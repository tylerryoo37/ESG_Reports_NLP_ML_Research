21284,21284,3M has a process in place to develop reasonable estimates for avoided emissions associated with the use of select 3M products.,3M,0
21285,21285,This estimation procedure is based on the ISO 14064-2 standard for determining GHG emissions reductions.,3M,0
21286,21286,It provides a framework for the estimation of emissions from the 3M product scenario (referred to as the “project scenario”) in relation to a baseline scenario.,3M,0
21287,21287,We start by defining the boundary of the 3M product scenario as ‘cradle’ (extraction from nature) through product use (product end-of-life is included where information is available).,3M,0
21288,21288,The GHG emissions for the 3M product scenario are calculated using life cycle assessment or are estimated using screening-level data.,3M,0
21289,21289,The same methods are used to estimate the GHG emissions for the baseline or comparative scenario.,3M,0
21290,21290,"Where the data availability differs from the 3M product scenario, we apply conservative assumptions as needed.",3M,0
21291,21291,"For example, if emissions data is not available for an aspect of the baseline scenario, we assume the emissions to be zero.",3M,0
21292,21292,The result is a comparison that conservatively estimates the potential impact of the 3M product.,3M,0
