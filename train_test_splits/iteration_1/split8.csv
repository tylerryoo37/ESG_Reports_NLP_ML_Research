1588,"Upon completion of the PTS expansion for which PT-FI will have majority ownership and the construction of the new greenfield smelter at Gresik, GHG emissions for smelting and refining are expected to  shift from Scope 3 to Scopes 1 or 2, and we will adjust our target and baseline in line with the GHG Protocol at such time.",0
1589,"While we plan to initially use biodiesel to fuel the DFPP, we are studying the feasibility of switching the fuel supply to  LNG, which could further reduce GHG emissions and provide other benefits, including potential energy cost savings.",0
1590,Nucor committed to a 35% combined reduction in its direct emissions (Scope 1) and indirect emissions from purchased electricity (Scope 2) GHG intensity for its steel mills segment by 2030.,1
