      "Foreword Microsoft’s sustainability commitments: two years into our ten-year journey By Brad Smith, President and Vice Chair and Dr. Lucas Joppa, Chief Environmental Officer As we look towards 2030, the world will need all the ingenuity it can muster.\n",
      "\n",
      "Because as significant as COVID-19 is, it’s not the only challenge our world faces.\n",
      "\n",
      "Climate change presents environmental, social, and economic crises on a whole new level.\n",
      "\n",
      "For nearly two millennia humans have been carbonizing our planet and we need to act together to decarbonize.\n",
      "\n",
      "Our first annual sustainability report, released in January 2021, showed early progress on our commitments to become a carbon negative, water positive, zero waste company by 2030 and protect ecosystems by building a Planetary Computer.\n",
      "\n",
      "2021 was a year of both successes and challenges.\n",
      "\n",
      "While we continued to make progress on several of our goals, with an overall reduction in Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions, our Scope 3 emissions increased year over year, due in substantial part to significant global datacenter expansions and the growth in Xbox sales and usage as a result of the pandemic.\n",
      "\n",
      "A closer look at 2021 During our most recent fiscal year, we grew business revenue by 20 percent while continuing to reduce our operational emissions, as represented by Scope 1 and 2 combined, with a decrease of approximately 17 percent through our purchasing of renewable energy.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, as our business has grown and we’ve seen increased use of our devices and cloud services, our total Scope 3 emissions (comprising the company’s entire value chain) have increased by about 23 percent year-over-year.\n",
      "\n",
      "These emissions include, among other things, the carbon emitted from electricity generation to power devices at home or at work and for producing the concrete and steel we use in construction.\n",
      "\n",
      "We work to limit these emissions when we design and manufacture our products, and work with our suppliers to report and reduce their emissions—but still saw an increase.\n",
      "\n",
      "This serves as an important reminder that Scope 3 emissions are the most difficult to control and reduce.\n",
      "\n",
      "This year has highlighted the challenges of reducing Scope 3 emissions and we’re committed to sharing our learnings to help other organizations who are wrestling with these same challenges.\n",
      "\n",
      "One Scope 3 category that saw an annual increase was capital equipment.\n",
      "\n",
      "This category includes the emissions to produce equipment we bought this year (and will use for a long time) as well as the carbon emissions associated with the construction of new buildings including both datacenters and office space.\n",
      "\n",
      "For example, as the Microsoft Cloud business expands, construction of new datacenters and new server equipment is needed to support growing customer demand.\n",
      "\n",
      "The emissions associated with the capital equipment category accounted for about 30 percent of our Scope 3 total this year.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another Scope 3 category that saw an increase was the use of our products, specifically the estimated emissions associated with powering products we sold including Xbox and Surface devices.\n",
      "\n",
      "This category accounted for about 29 percent of our Scope 3 total this year.\n",
      "\n",
      "Around the world, the electricity used to power devices today largely comes from grids reliant on carbon- intensive sources such as coal or gas, so Microsoft must account for that carbon for the lifetime of our devices to accurately track our Scope 3 emissions.\n",
      "\n",
      "And, because every part of the world has a different mix of electricity generation sources, we calculate a device’s climate impact based on where the device was sold.\n",
      "\n",
      "The journey to net zero Despite these Scope 3 increases, we remain dedicated to building a world better than the one we found, and to helping our customers and partners achieve the same.\n",
      "\n",
      "The impact of this work will not all be felt immediately, and our experience this year highlights a few takeaways relevant to many organizations executing against their sustainability commitments.\n",
      "\n",
      "Progress won’t always be linear.\n",
      "\n",
      "The rate at which we can implement emissions reductions is dependent on many factors that can fluctuate over time, ranging from our own business growth and supplier mix to the rate of growth of green infrastructure, such as the supply of and transition speed to renewable energy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Additionally, different sources of emissions will be addressed on different time frames as climate technologies and renewable alternatives advance.\n",
      "\n",
      "And as measurement methodologies improve and new standards emerge, companies like ours may see emissions rise or fall year-over-year.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nonetheless, the challenge remains: we must continuously improve on our efforts to decouple our emissions from our growth until we reach our carbon negative commitment in 2030.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some of this will happen through the completion of specific goals such as our shift to a 100 percent electric campus vehicle fleet, our move away from diesel fuel as a backup energy source for our datacenters, and the carbon benefits of our waste reduction improvements due to our expanding fleet of Circular Centers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Other progress will happen through the expansion of our renewable energy purchasing program to cover the energy consumption of our consumer devices, through advances by our suppliers in reducing their own emissions, and through increased purchasing of new materials as they enter the markets, including green steel, low carbon concrete, and other infrastructure components of a future net zero carbon economy.\n",
      "\n",
      "4 Overview Carbon Water Waste Ecosystems Appendix\n",
      "\n",
      "Progress relies on us all counting carbon consistently.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are several external factors or bugs in the world’s net zero carbon program that if addressed will help us all make greater progress toward our net zero goals.\n",
      "\n",
      "The world lacks a common meaning of the term net zero and a common unit of measurement for assessing the climate impact of various net zero approaches, and we must all focus on maturing the markets needed to achieve a net zero carbon economy by 2050.\n",
      "\n",
      "We explored these topics in greater detail through the lens of our work on carbon removal.\n",
      "\n",
      "We will continue to innovate and invest to meet our ambitious commitments and we’ll do so in a principled way.\n",
      "\n",
      "We will also continue to be transparent about our progress, our challenges, and our learnings to help others on their journey.\n",
      "\n",
      "As we look to the future we are committed to: • Counting everything, including challenging Scope 3 emissions.\n",
      "\n",
      "We are putting programs in place to help lower them, from working with our suppliers to help them decarbonize to continuing to innovate with our company-wide internal carbon tax to incentivize emissions reduction and continuing to invest in carbon removal.\n",
      "\n",
      "• Only investing in carbon removal offsets instead of traditional avoided emissions offsets because removal is an underdeveloped and critical tool to solve the world’s climate challenge.\n",
      "\n",
      "You can only get to net zero when you’ve reduced all that you can and your remaining carbon emissions are completely balanced by long-term carbon removal.\n",
      "\n",
      "Last year, we made the world’s largest purchase of carbon removal at 1.4 million metric tons and in this fiscal year we are on track to top that by procuring 1.5 million metric tons.\n",
      "\n",
      "From pledges to progress While 2021 presented us with some new learnings, we’ve also made some great progress that we share in more detail in this report.\n",
      "\n",
      "A few examples that illuminate the diversity of our work include the following.\n",
      "\n",
      "• Four datacenters are Zero Waste certified, with new certifications for the San Antonio, Texas and Quincy, Washington datacenters and renewed certifications for our Boydton, Virginia and Dublin, Ireland locations.\n",
      "\n",
      "• We announced the Microsoft Cloud for Sustainability to provide comprehensive, integrated, and automated sustainability management for organizations at any stage of the sustainability journey.\n",
      "\n",
      "• Through an investment from our Climate Innovation Fund, we’re helping LanzaJet complete their sustainable fuels plant in Georgia—a move that will help decarbonize our datacenters as well as the airline industry.\n",
      "\n",
      "• While overall device emissions grew because of higher sales and usage, we reduced the carbon footprint for several of our products.\n",
      "\n",
      "Surface Pro 8 is one of the most energy efficient Surface Pros ever and we introduced Energy Saver, a new low-power standby mode for Xbox consoles.\n",
      "\n",
      "• We granted $100 million to Breakthrough Energy Catalyst to accelerate the development of climate solutions the world needs to reach net-zero across four key areas: direct air capture, green hydrogen, long duration energy storage, and sustainable aviation fuel.\n",
      "\n",
      "We are committed to becoming a carbon negative, water positive, zero waste company by 2030.\n",
      "\n",
      "With net zero becoming the new normal—more than 1,500 companies with total net revenue of $11.4 trillion have pledged that they will become carbon neutral or net zero—the world must move from climate pledges to climate progress.\n",
      "\n",
      "As a leading technology provider of sustainable solutions, Microsoft stands ready to support our customers, partners, and the world in the move towards a net zero, environmentally sustainable future.\n",
      "\n",
      "And while the shape of what the future holds is unknown, we will continue to build the foundations needed today and do the work that needs to be done to deliver on our commitments.\n",
      "\n",

      "Carbon removal is a seller’s market.\n",
      "\n",
      "The pipeline is short for surging demand, and corporate buyers need more project development.\n",
      "\n",
      "Climate change is further complicating this, as wildfires erode the forest carbon purchases we’ve made and we, as well as other purchasers, need expanded credit buffers to ensure credits we pay for are removing carbon from the atmosphere.\n",

      "2 Progress on carbon reduction will be “lumpy” as carbon data and measurement improves.\n",
      "\n",
      "As Microsoft and the world mature in carbon accounting, we will continue to get better at understanding how our decisions reduce, or sometimes increase, carbon emissions.\n",
      "\n",
      "For example, some of the data used to estimate hardware emissions within certain categories of Scope 3 is drawn from industry-average “secondary” data rather than directly from suppliers.\n",
      "\n",
      "This data may not be reflective of recent supplier activity, which may cause fluctuations in emissions as primary data from suppliers is introduced.\n",
      "\n",
