      "As part of our journey to lead a thriving cocoa sector, in 2012, we committed to invest $400 million over 10 years to empower 200,000 cocoa farmers and improve the lives of approximately one million people living in cocoa communities.\n",
      "\n",
      "And in 2019, we set a new goal to source 100% of our cocoa volumes for chocolate brands through Cocoa Life by 2025.\n",

      "\n",
      "We are also launching new products and line extensions with less saturated fat and salt without sacrificing the quality, flavor or texture people have grown to trust and love in our brands.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sugar Sugar plays an important part in many of our snacks, for example giving them great taste and texture.\n",
      "\n",
      "We know some people want to limit their sugar intake as part of reducing calories.\n",
      "\n",
      "This aligns with the WHO and other health agencies’ advice to limit added sugar to no more than 10% of daily calories.\n",
      "\n",
      "We have launched and continue to expand options with less sugar.\n",
      "\n",
      "Whole Grains Most consumers do not get enough whole grains in their diet, so we try to provide them in our snacks.\n",
      "\n",
      "For example in 2021 we launched new belVita baked bars in Europe and TUC integrale with wholegrains in Italy.\n",
      "\n",
      "We continue to provide over 9 billion servings of whole grains with our products.\n",

      "As a result, the child no longer participates in activities defined as child labor and is no longer at risk of being enlisted to undertake these activities.\n",
      "\n",
      "Due to case-by-case differences between child labor situations, remediation can be done at the child, household or community level.\n",
      "\n",
      "Remediation responsiveness, therefore, can range from almost instant (e.g., household awareness training that is conducted when data is collected and/or cases found) to 6–18 months (e.g., renovation of classrooms or school canteens to get kids back to school).\n",

      "Most instances of inappropriate child labor involve tasks such as carrying heavy loads like firewood or water, contact with agrochemicals or clearing of land with sharp tools.\n",
      "\n",
      "Child labor is distinct from forced labor, which is defined by the ILO as: Situations in which persons are coerced to work through the use of violence or intimidation, or by more subtle means such as accumulated debt, retention of identity papers or threats of denunciation to immigration authorities.\n",

      "PMI’s Statement of Purpose While Philip Morris International Inc. (“PMI” or the “Company”) is widely known as a cigarette company, in 2016 it announced its new purpose: to deliver a smoke-free future by focusing its resources on developing, scientifically substantiating, and responsibly commercializing smoke-free products that are less harmful than smoking, with the aim of completely replacing cigarettes as soon as possible.\n",
      "\n",
      "These innovative alternative products do not burn tobacco or create smoke, and therefore emit significantly lower levels of carcinogens and other toxic substances than cigarettes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Building on the Board’s Letter to Shareholders and the first Statement of Purpose in PMI’s 2017 and 2020 Proxy Statements respectively, we reaffirm PMI’s purpose and acknowledge that, as the Company continues to transform its business and organization, its core effort to provide smoke-free alternatives that appeal to today’s adult smokers— and to work hard to convince them to switch—will not be enough.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Company needs to continue earning the trust and active cooperation of a host of stakeholders, from supply chain partners to regulators and public health authorities.\n",
      "\n",
      "A smoke-free future is attainable, and the benefits it can bring to the people who would otherwise continue to smoke, and hence to global public health, are enormous.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, the Company cannot succeed alone.\n",
      "\n",
      "Together with governments and civil society, we can maximize this opportunity through a consensus that smoke-free alternatives, when subject to proper government oversight and regulation, are part of a sound tobacco policy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Smoking causes serious disease, and the best way to avoid the harms of smoking is never to start or, for those who smoke, to quit.\n",
      "\n",
      "For decades, tobacco control has focused on strict fiscal, marketing, and other measures to deter initiation and to encourage cessation.\n",
      "\n",
      "These must be continued.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nevertheless, while smoking prevalence rates continue to slowly decline, the World Health Organization projects that the estimated number of 1.1 billion people who smoke tobacco products today will remain largely unchanged by 2025, reflecting population growth.1 Nicotine, while addictive and not risk-free, is not the primary cause of smoking-related disease.\n",
      "\n",
      "The primary cause is the harmful chemicals emitted while burning tobacco and contained in the smoke.\n",
      "\n",
      "Eliminating combustion from nicotine-containing products is the way to significantly reduce their toxicity.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thanks to rapid advances in science and technology, and a strong PMI commitment, these products are now a reality.\n",
      "\n",
      "In 2016, with the full support of the Board of Directors, the Company announced its new purpose of delivering a smoke-free future.\n",
      "\n",
      "Since then, the Company has fully aligned its employees with this purpose and swiftly shifted its organizational focus and resources to smoke- free alternatives.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Company is essentially disrupting its traditional business from the inside out and is leading the industry in this unprecedented transformation.\n",
      "\n",
      "PMI’s smoke-free product portfolio currently includes heat-not-burn products, nicotine-containing vapor products, and oral nicotine products, all without combustion.\n",
      "\n",
      "Their development and manufacturing follow high standards of quality and consistency.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Company is committed to scientifically substantiating the harm reduction potential of its smoke-free alternatives compared to cigarette smoking, including through rigorous preclinical and clinical assessments and sophisticated systems toxicology.\n",
      "\n",
      "Our scientific findings are publicly available and peer- reviewed, and we have submitted many of our findings to regulatory authorities, including the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.\n",
      "\n",
      "The totality of the scientific evidence makes the Company confident that switching completely to smoke-free products is likely to present less risk of harm than continuing to smoke.\n",
      "\n",
      "Post- market surveillance is necessary to continue building this confidence and, over time, quantify the reduction in morbidity and mortality through epidemiology.\n",
      "\n",
      "To be clear, these smoke-free alternatives are not risk-free and should not be used by youth or adults who would not otherwise continue to smoke or use other nicotine products.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Company must market its smoke-free alternatives responsibly to minimize any unintended use while maximizing the switching of adult smokers who would otherwise continue smoking.\n",

      "While cigarette sales today remain the largest part of PMI’s business in most countries, this is changing rapidly.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Company is actively accelerating the decline of cigarette smoking beyond what traditional tobacco control measures can achieve alone.\n",
      "\n",
      "To make its progress both measurable and verifiable, the Company developed a set of bespoke key performance indicators called Business Transformation Metrics.\n",
      "\n",
      "This set of metrics and related goals, which PMI reports on periodically, allow stakeholders to assess both the pace and the scale of its transformation and showcase how it is allocating resources away from its traditional cigarette business, aiming to base success on a future where it no longer makes or sells cigarettes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Although the Company’s transformation journey started with a vision centered on the critical mission of phasing out cigarettes, this is not its sole or ultimate end goal.\n",
      "\n",
      "Researching and developing noncombustible alternatives that are scientifically substantiated to be less harmful than cigarettes was the first step.\n",
      "\n",
      "Broadening access for adult smokers while simultaneously and deliberately working to phase out cigarette smoking completed the equation of its smoke-free purpose.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the process, the Company has expanded its social, human, intellectual, and manufactured capital in ways that allow it to go a step further, moving from a value proposition centered on doing less harm toward one where it can seek to have a net positive impact on society.\n",
      "\n",
      "PMI is now actively working to expand its purpose and evolve into a broader lifestyle, consumer wellness and healthcare company, extending its value proposition and innovative capability to commercialize products that go beyond tobacco and nicotine.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is built on two key growth areas: (1) wellness products, where the Company is developing and looking to commercialize scientifically substantiated consumer health products and solutions with the aim to improve people’s lives (2) healthcare products, where it has already committed resources to its development pipeline of over-the-counter and prescription products.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is part of a larger transformation that puts science, technology, and sustainability at the heart of PMI’s future by building on the Company’s expertise and investment in aerosol chemistry and physics, device technology, clinical research, and best-in- class preclinical safety and inhalation models.\n",
      "\n",
      "Employees PMI’s ability to accomplish its purpose depends on the skills, dedication, and relentless efforts of its employees.\n",

      "The Company’s focus on a smoke-free future and long-term opportunities in wellness and healthcare has enhanced its ability to attract the new talent needed to support its transformation.\n",

      "The Company compensates its employees fairly and provides important benefits.\n",

      "It fosters diversity, inclusion, equal opportunity, and equal salary policies to ensure PMI’s workforce reflects modern society.\n",
      "\n",
      "Regulators Regulators can decisively accelerate the industry’s transformation toward, and the speed at which adult smokers switch to, smoke-free products by implementing risk-proportionate regulations and taxation for all nicotine-containing products and by providing smokers with accurate information.\n",
      "\n",
      "PMI is committed to engaging transparently with regulators, sharing its scientific research and post-market data.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Company is ready to support an industry-wide gradual phaseout of cigarettes as soon as a majority of smokers in a country have switched to scientifically substantiated smoke-free products.\n",
      "\n",
      "PMI believes that with the right regulatory encouragement and support from civil society, cigarette sales can end within 10 to 15 years in many countries.\n",
      "\n",
      "Public health community The public health community is, unfortunately, polarized on the issue of smoke-free products.\n",
      "\n",
      "Without question, their work to discourage youth and nonsmokers from starting to use any tobacco or nicotine product and to encourage cessation should continue.\n",
      "\n",
      "At the same time, when better alternatives to cigarettes exist, the discussion should not be whether they should be made available to the more than one billion people who smoke today, but how fast and within what regulatory framework to maximize their adoption while minimizing unintended use.\n",
      "\n",
      "PMI’s key stakeholder constituencies, which are fundamental to both the achieving of its purpose and to the pace of its progress, will be affected in different ways by PMI’s transformation.\n",

      "The Company will seek to engage and collaborate with relevant stakeholders to speed the transformation while mitigating negative consequences.\n",
      "\n",
      "Consumers Adult smokers and adult nicotine users are at the core of PMI’s business transformation.\n",
      "\n",
      "The public health benefit of smoke-free products depends not only on their potential to reduce the risk of smoking- related disease compared to continued smoking but also on if they are actually used as alternatives to cigarettes by as many adult smokers as possible.\n",
      "\n",
      "For smokers to switch to them, these alternatives must be accessible.\n",
      "\n",
      "Increasing accessibility means improving consumer awareness, acceptability, as well as the availability and affordability of our smoke-free products.\n",
      "\n",
      "Acceptability means delivering experiences that satisfy the needs of adult smokers while significantly reducing the exposure to the harmful and potentially harmful constituents of cigarette smoke.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is vital that we engage with adult smokers to raise awareness of smoke-free products and their benefits compared with cigarettes.\n",
      "\n",
      "While PMI will continue to responsibly sell cigarettes as long as there is a significant legitimate demand, it will leverage its leading position to accelerate switching to better alternatives, continuing to focus its commercial efforts toward raising awareness of, and informing adult smokers in appropriate ways about, scientifically substantiated smoke-free products and the benefits of switching versus continued smoking.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Company carefully monitors the results of its marketing to minimize any unintended use of its smoke-free products by nonsmokers, especially youth.\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition, PMI’s new businesses will leverage its know-how and capabilities in areas such as inhalation and aerosolization to create better products to target unmet medical and consumer needs and deliver a better experience and enhanced products for consumers and patients.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Company is urging this important stakeholder group to seize the immense opportunity that smoke-free products present for advancing public health within the current generation of smokers.\n",
      "\n",

      "Our comprehensive strategy also recognizes the need to address other ESG issues related to our products and business operations.\n",
      "\n",
      "As we accelerate our transition from cigarettes to smoke-free products, we must also minimize any adverse effects of our products on the planet.\n",
      "\n",
      "Our efforts in this area include striving to design our products in a way that optimizes the use of materials and improves circularity, as well as appropriately managing their end-of-life to minimize negative environmental impacts.\n",

      "On the environmental front, this means tackling climate change and preserving natural ecosystems.\n",

      "As a result, our approach to sustainability addresses our ESG priorities through eight impact-driven strategies.\n",

      "Four of these strategies focus on the impacts derived from our products and the remaining four strategies focus on the impacts derived from our business operations.\n",

      "We seek solutions that are mutually reinforcing.\n",
      "\n",
      "For instance, our approach to carbon compensation—supported by our portfolio of climate investments (read more here)—favors nature-based solutions in our supply chain that remove carbon by restoring and enhancing plants and the ecosystem while also providing benefits in the areas of biodiversity, water, and social impact.\n",
      "\n",
      "In other instances, addressing a particular topic may limit how we tackle another.\n",
      "\n",
      "For example, the core of our smoke-free strategy is to raise awareness of smoke-free products among adult smokers and broaden access to them.\n",
      "\n",
      "In doing so, however, it is critical that we limit our initiatives to minimize the risk that our messages will reach unintended audiences—namely, nonsmokers and youth.\n",
      "\n",
      "Necessary trade-offs such as this often occur in the course of our business transformation.\n",
      "\n",
      "For instance, the manufacturing processes of smoke-free consumables are more resource- intensive than for cigarettes—a circumstance that runs counter to our energy and water conservation efforts in our direct operations.\n",
      "\n",
      "We are tackling this challenge and improving operational efficiency to mitigate and reverse this impact (read more here).\n",
      "\n",
      "As another example, the growth of our smoke-free business will result in a simultaneous decline of our cigarette business.\n",
      "\n",
      "While this consequence is fully intended, it also necessarily translates into a gradual decrease in demand for tobacco leaf, which will have an undeniable impact on our contracted farmers.\n",

      "We seek to minimize the negative effects by improving the socioeconomic well- being and resilience of tobacco-farming communities (read more here).\n",
      "\n",
      "Given the multifaceted and complex nature of sustainable development, trade-offs are inherent to decision-making.\n",
      "\n",
      "In some circumstances, we are compelled to make sacrifices in one sustainability area to obtain benefits in another, at least for a period.\n",
      "\n",
      "In designing our strategies and programs, it is vital that we accurately analyze, comprehend, and account for situations of forced compromise, guided by our sustainability materiality assessment.\n",

      "Incorporating three lenses (stakeholder perspectives, outward impacts, and inward impacts), our sustainability materiality assessment serves as a compass with which to calibrate and prioritize competing ESG issues.\n",

      "\n",
      "• Product manufacturing: The manufacturing of PMI products involves different stages, from the sourcing of tobacco leaf and other materials, as well as smoke-free electronic devices, to the production process for cigarettes and smoke-free consumables.\n",
      "\n",
      "• Commercialization (marketing and distribution): Once products are manufactured under the relevant trademarks, they are commercialized in different geographies through various activities, including distribution, marketing, merchandising, trade, and consumer engagement.\n",

      "\n",
      "Our new sustainability materiality assessment helped us identify, prioritize, calibrate, and define the ESG topics to focus on.\n",
      "\n",
      "The results allowed us to revamp our ESG framework, categorize topics according to their environmental, social, or governance nature, and introduce two pillars: our products and our business operations.\n",
      "\n",
      "Besides having a framework that clearly organizes ESG issues, we introduced a new format that helps us convey our approach to sustainability.\n",
      "\n",
      "More concretely, this new format showcases how these ESG topics are organized and become inputs to a strategy that aims to be impact-driven.\n",
      "\n",
      "Addressing the impacts of our products remains at the core of our strategy.\n",
      "\n",
      "We, of course, start by focusing on their health impacts.\n",
      "\n",
      "Beyond that, we have established a clear distinction between the environmental and social impacts that derive from our products (what we produce) and the impacts that derive from our business operations (how we produce).\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition, we have made corporate governance an all-encompassing component of our strategy, recognizing its importance in embedding sustainability into corporate strategy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Framing these different impacts and their origins in this way crystallizes both our inputs and desired outcomes, bringing clarity to our organization in terms of how best to allocate resources and integrate sustainability into our ways of working.\n",

      "We hope it will also help external stakeholders understand our approach to sustainability from an impact perspective.\n",

      "We certainly welcome recent developments leading to more consistency in standards under strong governance frameworks.\n",

      "Maximize the benefits of smoke-free products Overview of IQOS scientific substantiation • No combustion in our IQOS tobacco heating system: The primary cause of smoking- related disease is the long-term exposure to the high levels of harmful chemicals generated by burning tobacco.\n",
      "\n",
      "By avoiding combustion, we can significantly reduce or eliminate the formation of harmful and potentially harmful constituents (HPHCs).\n",
      "\n",
      "• Reduction in emissions of harmful and potentially harmful constituents: We compared the chemical composition of the aerosol produced by IQOS with the smoke from a reference cigarette designed for scientific research purposes and found that the levels of HPHCs in the aerosol are reduced on average by 90 to 95 percent compared with those found in the reference cigarette’s smoke.\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition, extensive chemical characterization of the IQOS aerosol showed that there are approximately 10 times fewer constituents in IQOS aerosol than in the reference cigarette smoke.\n",
      "\n",
      "• No negative impact on overall indoor air quality: We also conducted chemistry and quality studies, which demonstrated that the use of IQOS does not negatively impact indoor air quality.\n",
      "\n",
      "• Reduced toxicity: We conducted toxicological studies for IQOS, both in vitro and in vivo, to determine whether the reduced formation of HPHCs in the aerosol leads to reduced toxicity.\n",

      "Results from the in vitro studies show that the IQOS aerosol is significantly less cytotoxic and genotoxic than the smoke from cigarettes.\n",
      "\n",
      "The in vivo studies found that, compared with cigarette smoke, the reduced exposure to toxicants results in significantly reduced lung inflammation and respiratory toxicity.\n",
      "\n",
      "• Reduced risk of cardiovascular disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and lung cancer in laboratory models: We conducted several systems toxicology studies to assess the disease-relevant biological mechanisms affected by exposure to toxicants, using human-derived in vitro cell cultures and organotypic tissue cultures.\n",
      "\n",
      "These showed that, compared with the reference cigarette smoke, the IQOS aerosol has a significantly reduced impact on key mechanisms involved in the development of respiratory and cardiovascular diseases.\n",

      "We also completed an in vivo study to assess the potential of the IQOS aerosol to reduce the risk of lung inflammation, emphysema, and lung cancer compared with cigarette smoke.\n",

      "TOXICOLOGICAL ASSESSMENT Toxicological assessments are used to determine whether the reduced formation of HPHCs leads to reduced toxicity and reduced risk of smoking-related diseases in laboratory models.\n",
      "\n",
      "• Good product understanding and low intent to use among nonsmokers: The results of our premarket studies show that the adult consumer groups tested have a very good understanding that IQOS presents less risk of harm than cigarettes but is not risk-free and that it is riskier than nicotine cessation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Additionally, when assessed in the context of specific communication materials, more than 90 percent of participants in consumer studies understood that IQOS is not intended for nonsmokers, and more than 80 percent comprehended that quitting the use of tobacco and nicotine altogether is the best way to reduce the risk of tobacco-related diseases.\n",
      "\n",
      "• Post-market monitoring and use patterns: We constantly monitor reports to identify safety concerns and health-related adverse events potentially associated with the use of our smoke- free products.\n",
      "\n",
      "Further, we conduct post-market studies to understand how IQOS is used and by whom, helping us measure the extent to which adult smokers switch to the product.\n",
      "\n",
      "By conducting repeated studies in 53 countries among adult IQOS users, involving in total about 70,000 participants, we have been able to measure IQOS use patterns among adult users over time.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, the data from these studies confirm that IQOS is reaching the intended audience of adult smokers (with a significant proportion of individuals who purchase the product switching fully to it and stopping smoking) and is of very limited interest to adults who have never used nicotine products or who had already stopped using tobacco.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, our post-market studies confirm that consumers understand that IQOS presents less risk than cigarettes but is not risk-free and presents more risk than tobacco and nicotine cessation.\n",
      "\n",
      "PERCEPTION AND BEHAVIOR Perception and behavior studies help us evaluate risk perceptions and patterns of use of smoke-free products among various adult consumer groups.\n",
      "\n",
      "For smoke-free products to have an overall positive impact on public health, it is important that adult smokers use them, that those intending to quit tobacco and nicotine altogether are not dissuaded by these products, and that nonsmokers do not use them.\n",
      "\n",
      "• Nicotine uptake: When a smoker is switching to IQOS, the nicotine uptake and urge-to-smoke scores are comparable to continued smoking.\n",
      "\n",
      "This suggests that switchers can find IQOS acceptable and satisfying as an alternative to smoking.\n",
      "\n",
      "• Reduced exposure to harmful chemicals: Our clinical studies on IQOS completed to date have involved thousands of participants and up to 12 months of exposure.\n",
      "\n",
      "They have found that smokers who switched completely to IQOS during the studies were exposed to significantly lower levels of harmful chemicals compared with those who continued to smoke.\n",
      "\n",
      "Further, they showed that the levels of 15 biomarkers of exposure in participants switching completely to IQOS were comparable to the levels of those who quit tobacco and nicotine for the duration of the study.\n",
      "\n",
      "• Positive impact on smokers’ health: In a six-month clinical study of healthy volunteers, we measured eight health indicators that are known to change favorably following smoking cessation.\n",
      "\n",
      "We observed that after participants had switched from smoking to IQOS for six months, each of these indicators improved in the direction expected upon smoking cessation, five of them with statistical significance.\n",
      "\n",
      "We completed a six-month extension study to understand what the same markers look like 12 months after switching.\n",
      "\n",
      "CLINICAL ASSESSMENT Clinical assessments help determine the extent to which adult smokers would find the product an acceptable alternative to cigarettes.\n",
      "\n",
      "They assess whether a reduction in the formation of HPHCs measured in the laboratory leads to a reduction in HPHC exposure when an adult smoker switches to the product and investigate whether switching from cigarettes to a smoke-free product has a beneficial effect on a smoker’s health profile by reducing the risk of smoking- related diseases compared with continued smoking.\n",
      "\n",
      "• Long-term effects of product use: Long-term epidemiological data are needed to accurately quantify the overall disease risk reduction effect associated with switching from cigarette smoking to the use of smoke-free products, as well as to evaluate the excess disease risk associated with the use of these products compared with not using tobacco and nicotine.\n",
      "\n",
      "Generating reliable epidemiological evidence requires that smoke-free products be available on the market for many years.\n",
      "\n",
      "Further, the products must be used for a sufficiently long period by a sufficient portion of adult smokers who have switched to them.\n",
      "\n",
      "This renders epidemiological studies impracticable in a premarket setting or in the early phase of market introduction.\n",
      "\n",
      "• Real-world evidence: We initiated time-trend studies in 2020 to complement our other research.\n",
      "\n",
      "These studies use existing data to estimate the prevalence and incidence of disease.\n",
      "\n",
      "They explore factors associated with health outcomes at the population level.\n",
      "\n",
      "Independent evidence already links the launch of IQOS to an accelerated decline in cigarette sales in Japan, the first country in which IQOS was launched nationwide, in 2015.\n",
      "\n",
      "We assessed time series of Japanese hospital data and health insurance claims for two smoking-related diseases (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and ischemic heart disease) to detect a potential impact of the introduction of IQOS at the population level.\n",
      "\n",
      "We obtained hospitalization rates for selected smoking-related endpoints: COPD, COPD exacerbations, and ischemic heart disease.\n",
      "\n",
      "This data came from two databases: Medical Data Vision and Japan Medical Data Center.\n",
      "\n",
      "We compared rates of hospitalization for these endpoints before and after the introduction of heated tobacco products (HTPs) in Japan.\n",
      "\n",
      "We found that observed hospitalization rates dropped below predicted rates shortly after launch.\n",
      "\n",
      "Those decreases so far are modest but measurable.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are many limitations to this type of research, and these results by themselves do not indicate a causal relationship.\n",

      "Leveraging the power of our brands to drive positive behavior change We engage with adult smokers in a variety of ways, including, where permitted, by leveraging our cigarette packaging.\n",
      "\n",
      "JustScan (formerly ScanPack) is a mobile digital platform that allows adult smokers to access online content by scanning a QR code or using a weblink (typically featured on the cigarette pack insert).\n",

      "For example, in November and December 2021, our affiliate in Japan deployed JustScan to increase awareness of IQOS ILUMA, reaching close to 150,000 adult smokers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Globally in 2021, we used JustScan to successfully engage with close to two million adult smokers in 50 markets (2020: 850,000 adult smokers in 30 markets).\n",

      "\n",
      "Our commercial activities must strike the right balance between encouraging adult smokers to switch to smoke-free products and minimizing the risk of unintended consequences such as youth access, initiation, and use by nonsmokers.\n",
      "\n",
      "The results of our perception and behavior assessment studies conducted to date as part of the scientific assessment of our IQOS product show that the adult consumer groups surveyed have a very good understanding that IQOS presents less risk than cigarettes but is not risk-free and is riskier than tobacco and nicotine cessation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Additionally, when assessed in the context of specific communication materials, more than 90 percent of participants in consumer studies understood that IQOS is not intended for nonsmokers, and more than 80 percent comprehended that quitting the use of all tobacco is the best way to reduce the risk of tobacco-related disease.\n",
      "\n",
      "Further, we conducted 12 studies of our heat-not- burn (IQOS) and e-vapor (IQOS VEEV) products in six markets in 2020–21, including interviews with more than 23,000 adults who were not consumers of tobacco or nicotine products.\n",
      "\n",
      "The results of those studies show very low intention to use our smoke-free products among adult former users of tobacco or nicotine products (0.6 percent) and adults who had never used tobacco or nicotine products (0.3 percent).\n",

      "However, results of our studies among the youngest legal age adults who were not consumers of tobacco or nicotine products— those aged 18 (or higher, depending on the legal age in the country) to 24—show a very low intent to use our smoke-free products (0.3 percent).\n",
      "\n",
      "We also conduct post-market studies to understand how our smoke-free products are used and by whom once available for purchase in a market.\n",

      "\n",
      "We consider the full conversion rate a critical indicator of whether our smoke-free products meet consumer expectations.\n",

      "The manufacture of HTUs also incurs other costs that do not apply to cigarettes, such as the costs of scientifically substantiating the reduced-risk profile of these products, and ongoing post-market studies.\n",
      "\n",
      "Importantly, they entail much higher commercialization costs compared with cigarettes due to the need to properly introduce consumers to these new products and explain their functionalities.\n",
      "\n",
      "These costs include, for example, our customer care call centers and follow-up to ensure users do not fall back into smoking during their conversion journeys.\n",
      "\n",
      "Beyond production and commercialization costs, a key factor driving tobacco and nicotine product retail prices is the excise tax.\n",
      "\n",
      "Excise taxes on cigarettes are generally higher than those on smoke-free products.\n",
      "\n",
      "Within the smoke-free category, electronic cigarettes tend to be taxed at a lower rate than heated tobacco products.\n",
      "\n",
      "Differential taxation is an appropriate fiscal policy given the fundamentally different risk profiles of combustible tobacco products versus smoke-free alternatives.\n",
      "\n",
      "Applied appropriately, this approach can incentivize adult smokers to switch away from cigarettes and other combustible tobacco products and encourage manufacturers to channel their investments and R&D away from cigarettes and toward smoke-free alternatives.\n",
      "\n",
      "The combined effect of manufacturer costs and tax differences is such that the price to the consumer of IQOS HTUs is typically below that of premium cigarettes—or can even be at the low end of cigarette pricing.\n",
      "\n",
      "As of the end of 2021, we estimate that our HTUs are on average priced the same as or lower than an adult smoker’s current cigarette brand for 58 percent of smokers in the geographies where we commercialize IQOS.\n",
      "\n",
      "To address potential affordability barriers, we are also expanding consumers’ choice of HTUs by offering brands at multiple price points in many markets.\n",

      "Rolling out our updated Marketing Codes Consistent with our category-based organization, our marketing and sales principles and practices are codified in two separate Marketing Codes: one for combusted tobacco products (an enhanced version of the previous Marketing Code that had been in place for years) and one for smoke- free (or “noncombusted”) alternatives.\n",
      "\n",
      "We rolled out these Codes internally early in 2021, building on our previous Marketing Code centered on combusted tobacco products and the Good Conversion Practices we had established to govern the marketing and sale of our smoke- free products.\n",

      "During the year, we worked to embed the norms of these Codes within our organization and trained employees and relevant third parties.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "We have now published our two Codes on our website and welcome stakeholder feedback on our responsible commercialization practices.\n",
      "\n",
      "Our Marketing Codes are accompanied by a set of internal guidelines that provide more detailed information on implementation.\n",

      "The shoppers are at least 19 years old, and all of them are smokers.\n",
      "\n",
      "They are tasked with acting interested in PMI smoke-free products and with going through various service interactions, such as making a purchase at an IQOS store, placing an online product order, or interacting with an IQOS coach.\n",
      "\n",
      "While doing so, they assess and record not only their consumer experience and the quality of service delivered, but also whether appropriate control measures were exercised to determine and verify (a) their age and (b) whether they are smokers or users of nicotine products.\n",
      "\n",
      "We receive detailed and regular reports on the mystery shoppers’ feedback, allowing us to identify cases in which adherence to our requirements is not being met.\n",

      "We piloted this program in seven markets in 2017, focusing on PMI’s IQOS boutiques.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the ensuing years, we significantly increased the scale of our efforts.\n",
      "\n",
      "By the end of 2021, the MSP had been implemented across our IQOS stores, contact centers, and e-commerce sites (depending on the retail and support channels available) in 60 markets where our smoke-free products are commercialized.\n",
      "\n",
      "Where COVID-19 conditions allowed it, mystery shoppers performed around 2,500 visits in 2021 to over 640 IQOS stores, visiting on different days and at different times of the day.\n",
      "\n",
      "In over 96 percent of those cases, they reported that their age had been properly checked prior to starting the conversation about the product—unless their appearance made clear that the mystery shopper was above the minimum legal age (or at least 18 years old in markets without a minimum legal age).\n",

      "We dedicated our May 2021 Scientific Update to examining the capabilities our research on smoke-free products has given us and discussing how we can apply those capabilities to develop new research initiatives and products.\n",
      "\n",
      "For example, in the inhaled therapeutics space, there are significant unmet patient needs for fast and effective treatments in cardiovascular (e.g., myocardial infarction), neurology (e.g., migraine and chronic pain), and allergies that can be served via innovative solutions.\n",
      "\n",
      "One of those solutions could be inhalable acetylsalicylic acid (commonly known as aspirin) for the prevention and treatment of myocardial infarction.\n",

      "Seek net positive impact in wellness and healthcare Strategic acquisitions Repurposing the tobacco plant beyond nicotine In 2021, the Quebec City-based biopharmaceutical company Medicago—in which PMI has a minority shareholding—applied for Canadian approval for its COVID-19 vaccine candidate.\n",
      "\n",
      "Medicago is a leader in proprietary plant-based technology that uses virus-like particles (VLPs) to develop protein-based vaccines instead of relying on animal products or live viruses.\n",
      "\n",
      "Virus-like particles are used to create plant-based vaccines, which mimic viruses, enabling the body’s immune system to recognize them and create an immune response.\n",
      "\n",
      "But they lack the core genetic material of a virus, so they are not infectious and cannot replicate.\n",
      "\n",
      "Medicago’s technology only requires the genetic sequence of a viral strain, not the live virus itself.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, the company can mass-produce a therapy to attack a pandemic infection like COVID-19 soon after health officials identify it.\n",
      "\n",
      "By comparison, traditional vaccine development in chicken eggs takes six to nine months.\n",
      "\n",
      "Using a plant-based approach is relatively new but has advanced rapidly in the past decade.\n",
      "\n",
      "For its COVID-19 vaccine, Covifenz, Medicago is using a virus-like particle grown in Nicotiana benthamiana, a close relative of the tobacco plant.\n",
      "\n",
      "This world-first, plant-derived COVID-19 vaccine was approved by Health Canada in late February 2022 and will be available in the country for adults aged 18 to 64.\n",
      "\n",
      "Due to the close alignment of its own R&D and the potential synergies with this pharma company, PMI acquired a stake in Medicago in 2013, and currently holds approximately 23 percent of the company’s shares, as part of a wider push into wellness and healthcare products.\n",
      "\n",
      "To complement our in-house science and innovation capabilities, we made solid progress during 2021 on our “Innovation in wellness and healthcare” strategy with the acquisitions of three innovative and forward-looking companies that we are excited to join forces with and that will form the backbone of our purpose and new wellness and healthcare business.\n",
      "\n",
      "In August, we announced the acquisition of inhaled drug specialist OtiTopic, a U.S. respiratory drug development company with a late-stage inhalable acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) candidate for the prevention and treatment of acute myocardial infarction.\n",
      "\n",
      "ASPRIHALE® is a patented, dry powder inhalation ASA, delivered through a unique self-administered aerosol.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is designed for patients at risk of heart attacks.\n",
      "\n",
      "In clinical trials, ASPRIHALE® catalyzed peak plasma concentration and pharmacodynamic (PD) effect in two minutes due to its inhalation approach, compared with the 28 minutes coated chewable aspirin took.\n",
      "\n",
      "This speed is unprecedented and can have significant implications for reducing the risk of morbidity and mortality.\n",
      "\n",
      "Cardiologists agreed that the rapid drug exposure and PD effects would be beneficial, especially during the time before the patient arrives at the hospital.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the U.S. alone, someone has a heart attack every 40 seconds.\n",
      "\n",
      "With its inhalable version of ASA, OtiTopic has developed an asset that promises to have a much faster onset of effect compared with oral ASA.\n",
      "\n",
      "PMI looks forward to completing the planned ASPRIHALE® registration program and bringing this important treatment to market to address a significant unmet medical need in a clinical condition where every second counts.\n",
      "\n",
      "In September, we announced the closing of the acquisition of Fertin Pharma, a leading developer and manufacturer of innovative pharmaceutical and well-being products based on oral and intraoral delivery systems.\n",
      "\n",
      "With Fertin Pharma’s substantial know-how and oral delivery platforms, we plan to develop scientifically substantiated consumer health products, including over-the-counter solutions and supplements for better living in areas such as sleep, energy, calm, and focus.\n",
      "\n",
      "By serving as a critical pillar of the new wellness and healthcare business, as part of PMI’s transformation, Fertin will be uniquely positioned to continue to innovate and grow— delivering on our vision of enabling people to live healthier lives.\n",
      "\n",
      "Our shared commitment to science and consumer-centric innovation forms a strong basis for a very successful future together.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fertin will also continue to grow and serve external customers as a leading contract development and manufacturing company (CDMO) in the oral formulation space.\n",
      "\n",
      "Furthermore, we acquired Vectura, a leading specialist inhalation CDMO that provides innovative inhaled drug development solutions to help clients bring inhalable medicines to patients.\n",
      "\n",
      "The market for inhaled therapeutics is growing rapidly outside the traditional spaces where inhalable medicines have been used over the years, focusing on specialty disease areas with high unmet medical need and hence with significant potential to expand into new application areas beyond the current market offering.\n",
      "\n",
      "Within the context of our new wellness and healthcare business, Vectura is well-positioned to address this market growth while becoming the backbone of the inhaled therapeutics arm.\n",
      "\n",
      "PMI has made a clear commitment to advance Vectura’s existing strategy, expand it geographically, and extend the company into the development of proprietary inhaled therapeutic products, alongside its existing CDMO business.\n",
      "\n",
      "This will benefit Vectura’s differentiated technologies and development expertise for the delivery of complex inhaled therapeutics and will enable us to bring our initial pipeline of inhaled therapeutic products to market.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "Nonetheless, our key objective remains to drive centralization of our efforts, as we believe this approach can bring several benefits, including economies of scale, regional investment, illicit trade prevention, and quality enhancements (accelerating design and manufacturing improvements).\n",
      "\n",
      "For instance, we released a global campaign and made a mobile application available for IQOS users in 18 markets that provides tips on how to use and clean the devices, as well as basic troubleshooting instructions.\n",
      "\n",
      "We also installed firmware upgrade retail solutions in all markets in which our smoke- free products are sold to make device maintenance more convenient and support product life-cycle extension.\n",

      "We took steps in 2021 to prepare and scale up capabilities at our CIRCLE hubs to enable the processing of devices for a second life.\n",
      "\n",
      "To guide us in this journey, we have set an ambitious target to refresh or repair at least one million smoke- free electronic devices by 2025 (cumulative since 2021).\n",

      "The collection consists of four SKUs and will be launched in three markets as a pilot.\n",
      "\n",
      "We expect this initiative to further encourage consumers to play an active role in reducing post-consumer waste.\n",
      "\n",
      "In 2021, to build a foundation for our device second-life program, we conducted pilots to test the IQOS refreshed value proposition in several markets across Europe and Asia.\n",
      "\n",
      "In five of these markets (Austria, Germany, Japan, Switzerland, and U.K.), we collected and refreshed devices returned by consumers at the end of the device trial period (our lending program allows adult smokers to test the product for a maximum of 30 days).\n",
      "\n",
      "Product refreshes do not involve replacing internal components but, rather, swapping in new external components when damaged, deep cleaning, and repackaging.\n",
      "\n",
      "We worked with our partners at our CIRCLE hubs in Hungary and Japan to apply triage criteria.\n",
      "\n",
      "We determined whether each component merited recovery or recycling, primarily focusing on the IQOS chargers and holders.\n",
      "\n",
      "We also considered user documents, packaging boxes, and charging cables.\n",
      "\n",
      "We refreshed around 62,000 devices during this pilot phase and resold them in eight markets (the five pilot countries plus Malaysia, New Zealand, and Portugal), either as a pilot or as part of the standard product assortment.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, the results of the pilots, along with consumers’ direct feedback and research insights, confirmed the validity and potential of the second-life concept and encouraged us to continue our journey toward circularity.\n",
      "\n",
      "The refreshed products were sold at lower price points than new ones and demonstrated high consumer satisfaction.\n",
      "\n",
      "Also in 2021, we piloted an extended collection of used devices from consumers in two markets: the Czech Republic and Slovakia.\n",
      "\n",
      "Our take-back program has been designed to accept returns of any used devices consumers no longer want.\n",
      "\n",
      "We deployed dedicated collection boxes across our IQOS retail network, covering 56 shops in the Czech Republic and 19 in Slovakia.\n",
      "\n",
      "We then sent the returned electronic devices to the CIRCLE hub in Hungary for recycling.\n",
      "\n",
      "The initiative has been met with a very positive reaction from consumers.\n",
      "\n",
      "One of our next priorities will be to expand the collection of used devices via other consumer programs and increase their processing for a second life.\n",
      "\n",
      "We plan to further expand the program’s geographic coverage and will continue to increase our refresh and repair capabilities.\n",
      "\n",
      "“ Considering that we launched IQOS in the Czech and Slovak markets back in 2017, naturally some of our customers possess devices that have reached the end of their technological life cycle.\n",

      "\n",
      "As part of our regular employee listening, we ask employees three times a year to answer the following question: “How would you rate your psychological or emotional well-being at present?” This is measured on a five-point scale from very bad to very good.\n",
      "\n",
      "In October 2021, 61 percent of employees responded “good” or “very good.” While the score increased, we did not achieve the target we set in 2020 of 63 percent by 2021, likely because of the unexpected continuation of the pandemic.\n",
      "\n",
      "The gap of nine percentage points between men (64 percent) and women (55 percent) is substantial (and represents an increase from the gap of five percentage points recorded in October 2020) and requires further investigation.\n",
      "\n",
      "We will continue to track progress on this indicator and aim to achieve a 70 percent score by 2025.\n",
      "\n",
      "To get deeper insights, we piloted a tailored well-being study across six of our markets (one per region) in 2021.\n",
      "\n",
      "The study methodology incorporated a survey (to which more than 3,600 office-based employees responded) and analytics aggregating information on the use of computer-based tools by employees (data were drawn from those employees who agreed to share such information on a confidential basis).\n",
      "\n",
      "This two-pronged approach allowed us to analyze the root causes of well-being, ranging from our ways of working and relationships with managers to presenteeism and employees’ sense of belonging.\n",

      "\n",
      "Worryingly, issues of mental health are a growing problem globally, affecting nearly 10 percent of the world’s population and causing devastating impacts for the individuals directly affected and those close to them.1 There is also a business impact: Depression alone is estimated to cause USD 1 trillion in lost productivity every year.2 Strengthening resilience To build a solid well-being program, we must also look at how society and the workplace will evolve.\n",

      "\n",
      "A total of more than 1,600 smallholder farmers, covering nearly 2,900 hectares opted for mechanization services provided by 32 local entrepreneurs.\n",
      "\n",
      "This mechanization initiative, in combination with other agricultural practices, generated a 10 percent increase in yields and the mechanized plowing itself has reduced by 37 percent the labor hours required for the land preparation of one hectare in Malawi.\n",
      "\n",
      "Meanwhile in Mozambique, we initiated a mechanization pilot which we expect will cover 170 hectares.\n",
      "\n",
      "In Argentina, the mechanization program continued in 2021 with the objective to improve farm productivity, mitigate potential risks associated with manual tasks, and contribute to soil conservation.\n",
      "\n",
      "These services included soil preparation, transplanting, CPA spraying, and harvesting, with the predominant activity being soil preparation.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the North West region of Argentina where flue-cured tobacco is grown, the mechanization initiatives generated a 30 percent reduction in the overall labor hours needed for the various crop stages.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the North East region, where our Burley farmers are located, mechanized farmers were able to reduce by more than 50 percent the labor requirements for land preparation and have achieved an 18 percent increase in yields in the last crop season compared with nonmechanized farmers.\n",
      "\n",
      "In India, the focus of the mechanization program is to increase labor efficiency and, in 2021, we implemented multiple initiatives with varying coverage among the farmer base.\n",
      "\n",
      "These initiatives included seeding machines, transplanters, cultivators combined with fertilizer applicator, suckercide applicators, and stringing machines.\n",
      "\n",
      "The predominant initiative is combining cultivators with fertilizer applicators, with 69 machines to date covering over 2,200 hectares and more than 2,800 farmers.\n",

      "\n",
      "The results obtained showed us that, with the mechanical transplanter, farmers were able to gain 41 percent efficiency compared with manual transplanting, the earthing up tools increased efficiency by 82 percent versus the manual work, the suckercide applicator led to a 25 percent efficiency gain, and, finally, the stringing machine resulted in a 27 percent efficiency gain compared with the manual stick and tying, also contributing to a reduction of child labor incidents.\n",

      "\n",
      "In some cases, farmers are not heavily reliant on tobacco production for their livelihoods, have the means to easily switch to other crops, or will continue to grow tobacco for other customers.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "Many of the gender inequalities faced by women in general are exacerbated for women in agriculture.\n",
      "\n",
      "Globally, less than 15 percent of agricultural land is owned by women,1 and women involved in tobacco farming often face structural and cultural barriers such as gender gaps in earnings, financial inclusion, access to credit, employment segmentation, lack of ownership of land and property, inadequate opportunities to receive training or technical support, and difficulty balancing domestic responsibilities.\n",
      "\n",
      "Since the inception of our ALP program, gender equality and fair treatment have been incorporated as key principles in all the countries from which we source tobacco.\n",
      "\n",
      "When we evolved the program to include a Step Change approach in 2018, we seized the opportunity to strengthen our contribution to gender equality, taking into consideration the instrumental role women play in improving household economic conditions and addressing child labor and other social challenges.\n",
      "\n",
      "Consequently, PMI’s ALP program now deploys across our sourcing markets several initiatives focused on women empowerment.\n",
      "\n",

      "In addition, these unofficial benchmarks may vary due to supply and demand for workers during the key crop stages and payment to women workers is typically lower compared to men.\n",
      "\n",
      "Given the different wages paid to men and women workers and the fluctuating unofficial benchmarks, PMI together with our local suppliers considered it necessary to monitor the payment of wages throughout the various tobacco stages.\n",

      "The monitoring is based on key data collected, including the number of hired men and women workers, actual wages paid, and the number of hours they work, among others.\n",
      "\n",
      "Based on these data points, a weighted average of the combined tasks performed during the crop season per farm is applied to determine if the farmer is paying the legal minimum wage.\n",

      "Setting up our Portfolio of Climate Investments In 2021, we created a Portfolio of Climate Investments (PCI) to standardize and provide transparency on our approach to investments in offsets and insets.\n",
      "\n",
      "Such investments compensate for unavoidable carbon emissions related to our direct operations and are essential to achieving our 2025 carbon neutrality goal.\n",
      "\n",
      "To ensure management’s endorsement and alignment with the mid-term strategy of the company, the PCI is supervised by an advisory committee composed of cross-functional PMI senior leaders (including our Chief Sustainability Officer and SVP, Operations, among others).\n",

      "The committee revises and validates the proposals prepared by the project team and approves the allocation of resources to the proposed climate solutions through an investment strategy that leverages the budget generated by PMI’s carbon levy scheme.\n",
      "\n",
      "To support decarbonization efforts, PMI believes that limiting the use of market approaches (offsetting) in the short-term by prioritizing direct investment in our supply chain in the medium and long term (insetting) will result in a climate investment strategy that is cost-effective, transparent, consistent, and of high quality.\n",
      "\n",
      "We expect a higher annual budget in the first years of running the PCI, in line with PMI’s business emissions profile, to support investments in a long- term climate solution.\n",
      "\n",
      "The financial requirements of PMI’s PCI are expected to decrease once medium- and long-term scope 1+2 carbon reduction investments become operational and generate emissions reductions or removals.\n",
      "\n",
      "We also anticipate a decrease in the levy budget as our emissions profile shrinks.\n",
      "\n",
      "Where additional funding will be required for specific investments (e.g., unlocking innovative climate solutions and R&D), the advisory committee that governs the PCI will decide on approval.\n",

      "A set of mechanisms and rules—the PCI quality criteria— allows PMI to efficiently evaluate which climate solutions are most appropriate to pursue.\n",
      "\n",
      "Core carbon principles and additional attributes strongly support the development of nature-based solutions in PMI’s supply chain that generate benefits beyond carbon reduction or removal, such as ecosystem conservation and enhancement and positive impacts on local communities.\n",
      "\n",
      "To assess whether an investment will meet our quality criteria and generate a positive impact, we employ an external due diligence process managed with a proprietary methodology developed with PMI’s carbon finance adviser Clarmondial.\n",
      "\n",
      "This methodology considers GHG mitigation, biodiversity conservation, and community benefits.\n",
      "\n",
      "Clarmondial also supported PMI in establishing relationships that can support the company’s long-term climate, community, and nature-related targets in priority countries.\n",
      "\n",
      "In 2021, PMI’s PCI invested over USD 4 million in projects in Brazil, Laos, Malawi, Mozambique, and Uganda, with a focus on forest protection, reforestation, and the enhancement of quality of life through activities such as the provision of clean water access.\n",
      "\n",
      "Moreover, the PCI focused on securing high-quality offsets to support PMI’s decarbonization journey, and provided the required carbon offsets for the five manufacturing sites that achieved carbon neutrality certification during the calendar year.\n",
      "\n",
      "Pricing carbon Assigning a price—and hence a theoretical cost—to emissions makes the intangible tangible and further incentivizes action to reduce the emissions that contribute to global warming.\n",
      "\n",
      "PMI reviewed its carbon pricing policy in 2020 and took a pioneering approach by developing two complementary internal carbon pricing instruments: a shadow price of USD 65 per ton of CO2e and a carbon levy of USD 8 per ton of CO2e.\n",
      "\n",
      "Our shadow carbon price is integrated into the preparation and financial evaluation of business proposals that will impact our carbon emissions.\n",
      "\n",
      "This was instrumental in helping justify the approval of eight carbon emission reduction projects in 2021.\n",
      "\n",
      "While the shadow price helps prioritize the business case for investments in activities aimed at structurally reducing carbon emissions, our carbon levy helps determine the investments required to abate our emissions through offsetting or insetting initiatives.\n",
      "\n",
      "The levy is designed to internalize costs and support behavioral change by imposing a virtual internal tax on selected business units for their GHG emissions.\n",
      "\n",
      "This helps us determine a budget for a portfolio of climate investments dedicated to projects focused on nature-based solutions and community investments in markets relevant to PMI’s supply chain and to our global environmental strategy.\n",

      "\n",
      "Nicotine occurs naturally in tobacco and, at significantly lower levels, in some other plant varieties from the Solanaceae family, which includes tomatoes, potatoes, and eggplant.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is possible to extract nicotine from tobacco, as is done to derive the nicotine contained in nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) products and e-liquids for e-cigarettes.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is also possible to produce synthetic nicotine.\n",
      "\n",
      "While this process is relatively costly, there are an increasing number of products (e-liquids and nicotine pouches) that are now using synthetic nicotine.\n",
      "\n",
      "The route of nicotine administration (e.g., via the lung, mouth, or skin) influences the speed and amount of nicotine uptake into the body.\n",
      "\n",
      "When tobacco smoke or e-cigarette aerosol is inhaled into the lung, it is rapidly absorbed into the bloodstream and can reach the brain as quickly as 10–20 seconds after the puff is taken.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nicotine from oral tobacco products (e.g., snus, nicotine pouches, NRT gum) is absorbed into the bloodstream through oral tissues, and the nicotine concentration in the blood rises gradually, reaching a plateau in about 30 minutes.\n",
      "\n",
      "The rise in brain nicotine concentration is slower compared with the inhalation route.\n",
      "\n",
      "A certain amount of the orally administered nicotine is swallowed and absorbed, mostly in the small intestine, before passing to the liver, where it is metabolized (i.e., transformed to facilitate excretion of nicotine from the body).\n",
      "\n",
      "Nicotine, when absorbed through the skin, reaches a plateau concentration in the blood more slowly than via other routes of administration.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, the level typically is maintained for a longer period.\n",
      "\n",
      "Once nicotine is absorbed into the circulatory system, it is distributed to all body tissues and organs, including the brain.\n",
      "\n",
      "There, nicotine binds to specific receptor molecules, mimicking the actions of a naturally occurring brain chemical, the neurotransmitter acetylcholine.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nicotine is metabolized mainly in the liver.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nicotine absorbed via the lung and oral tissues reaches the brain directly without first passing through the liver to be metabolized, whereas nicotine absorbed via the gut passes first through the liver to be metabolized and is partially excreted before reaching the brain.\n",

      "In this domain, we are acting on three axes: 1.\n",

      "Nicotine and addiction Nicotine is an addictive chemical compound present in tobacco and tobacco products.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the addictive properties of smoking involve a more complex interaction of factors than nicotine alone.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ritual, the sensory experience, and social experiences also play a significant role in addiction.\n",
      "\n",
      "Exposure to nicotine and the extent of its effects can also be influenced by individual differences in smoking behavior, metabolism, body mass, and genetics.\n",
      "\n",
      "Continual use of nicotine may lead to dependence or physiological adaptations to maintain homeostasis, which are most evident in the emergence of withdrawal symptoms experienced during cessation.\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition to other physiological responses, long-term use of nicotine can induce changes in the brain’s reward and stress systems, which may manifest as anxiety, dysphoria, and other negative affect states during long-term withdrawal.\n",
      "\n",
      "Physiological dependence, coupled with altered responses from the reward and stress system, can make quitting very difficult.\n",
      "\n",
      "The rapid uptake and delivery of nicotine to the brain’s reward system via lung delivery is thought to be a primary reason for the addictive potential of cigarettes and other inhaled tobacco products.\n",
      "\n",
      "When someone smokes a cigarette, the nicotine levels peak quickly (in about six to 10 minutes), and then the level of nicotine drops fairly rapidly as it is metabolized.\n",
      "\n",
      "Most nicotine replacement therapies do not provide this same pharmacokinetic profile, making them less likely to be addictive but also less likely to satisfy smokers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Two critical factors are the dose and rate of nicotine delivery.\n",
      "\n",
      "NRTs and other cessation products can help address nicotine withdrawal symptoms.\n",
      "\n",
      "The use of NRTs is recommended for eight to 12 weeks, although use for six months or longer may be necessary to achieve optimal quit rates.\n",
      "\n",
      "It makes sense to use NRTs to support smoking cessation for as long as the individual feels at risk of relapse.\n",
      "\n",
      "NRTs, however, are not as satisfying as cigarette smoking.\n",
      "\n",
      "Firstly, they do not provide the ritual, sensory experience, and social components that complete the experience of consuming nicotine via smoking.\n",
      "\n",
      "Secondly, the route and speed of absorption of nicotine is different: Often, the NRTs that rapidly deliver high doses of nicotine, such as sprays and inhalators, are more satisfying to smokers than are those that slowly deliver nicotine at much lower doses, such as gums and patches.\n",

      "An Integrated Business Our environmental, social and governance (ESG) priorities are integrated into our strategy.\n",

      "\n",
      "Beginning in 2021, our reporting has been centered around a series of ESG issue briefs covering each of Walmart’s priority ESG issues in depth.\n",
      "\n",
      "Each of the 17 briefs covers our aspiration and strategy with respect to that issue, the relevance of the issue to business and society, our key goals and metrics and our progress to date.\n",

      "As discussed in Walmart’s fiscal year 2022 annual report on Form 10-K, the COVID-19 pandemic impacted Walmart’s business in many ways throughout FY2022, including through net-sales growth and strong comparable sales in a majority of our international markets, pandemic-related costs, changes in customer shopping patterns and employment trends.\n",

      "\n",
      "As we celebrate Walmart’s 60th anniversary this year, that purpose still guides us as we work to create environmental, social and economic progress in ways that strengthen our business and benefit our stakeholders.\n",
      "\n",
      "We believe a business’s long-term success will depend on its work to help create a strong, resilient society —for all.\n",
      "\n",
      "In 2005, we committed to shifting our mindset and broadening our view to take a multi-stakeholder approach to our business.\n",
      "\n",
      "This means not only do we want to be the primary destination for our customers and return value to our shareholders, but we want to do it in a way that creates value for all stakeholders —including our associates, suppliers and other partners, communities and the planet.\n",
      "\n",
      "As we engage and serve our stakeholders, we grow and strengthen our business—and vice versa.\n",
      "\n",
      "If the past couple years have reinforced anything, it’s the need for this kind of shared value approach.\n",
      "\n",
      "At Walmart, this isn’t something sprinkled throughout our business or added on as an afterthought—we strive to use this approach in all aspects of our business and help guide us.\n",
      "\n",
      "Throughout our journey, we have set goals, measured progress and reported on that progress.\n",
      "\n",
      "And we continually push ourselves, which is why we elevated our aspiration by making a commitment to become a regenerative company—one that puts people and nature at the center of our business practices.\n",
      "\n",
      "This commitment touches all parts of our business.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is anchored in our purpose—and we do that in a way that strives to create equitable opportunity for our associates and suppliers, enhance the sustainability of retail and product supply chains, help create more resilient communities and operate with the highest standards of ethics and integrity.\n",
      "\n",
      "Having a healthy business for the long-term requires healthy relationships and a healthy planet.\n",

      "\n",
      "There is a path of opportunity for everyone here.\n",
      "\n",
      "As I’ve visited stores, clubs and DCs over the past year, I’ve enjoyed talking with the many associates who are creating long, meaningful careers at Walmart.\n",
      "\n",
      "Last year, we promoted more than 135,000 associates to positions of greater responsibility and we continue to support and invest in them with job training, rising wages and by making it easier to gain a college degree or certificate by covering the costs of tuition and books through our Live Better U program.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the U.S., 40 percent of management promotions went to people of color and 45 percent to women.\n",
      "\n",
      "Creating opportunities for people is an important part of our work to become a regenerative company and we believe our success will depend on advancing prosperity and equity for all.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is also at the heart of our work with communities.\n",
      "\n",
      "When disaster strikes, we are there with food, water and helping hands—but we are there every day strengthening communities.\n",
      "\n",
      "Last year, in the U.S. alone, our associates volunteered close to 1,000 hours a day to causes they care about and the company donated more than $1.5 billion in cash, food and other products globally.\n",
      "\n",
      "Our experience confirms for us that, when we understand what a community needs and partner with others, we can strengthen the environment to create more opportunities for the people who live there and end up with a stronger business.\n",
      "\n",
      "Regeneration also means strengthening our planet.\n",
      "\n",
      "This spring, we hit a major milestone with Project Gigaton™: We are halfway toward our goal to reduce or avoid one billion metric tons of greenhouse gases from the global supply chain by 2030.\n",
      "\n",
      "Since 2017, our suppliers have reported a cumulative total of more than 574 million metric tons of emissions reduced or avoided.\n",
      "\n",
      "Additionally, we recently raised $2 billion through our first green bond and for the past four years we have received an A or A- score from CDP for our transparency on climate action.\n",
      "\n",
      "After 60 years in business, we are reflecting on the moments of celebration, challenge and change throughout our history.\n",
      "\n",
      "These milestones have a way of making you think about the future.\n",
      "\n",
      "Though you’ll see some of the progress we’ve made this past year in this report, we know there’s more to be done.\n",
      "\n",
      "We will continue to look for ways to make a difference and remain eager to collaborate—we need more businesses and NGOs, as well as governments, to get involved and do more.\n",
      "\n",
      "This work requires collective action.\n",
      "\n",
      "When our children and grandchildren look back at the work we’re doing now, I hope it’s clear we were part of the solution— working every day to make this world a better place.\n",

      "Yet despite such challenges—or as much spurred on by them— we are more committed than ever to our efforts to become a regenerative company, one that puts humanity and nature at the center of our business practices.\n",

      "We believe that we maximize the value of our company for our customers and other stakeholders by tackling relevant, pressing societal issues through business.\n",

      "\n",
      "The customer, always.” In a year where so many communities turned to Walmart for access to affordable food, consumables, COVID-19 vaccines and other everyday essentials, it became clearer than ever that delivering our customer proposition is itself a central ESG contribution.\n",
      "\n",
      "Progress on rewiring systems for equity.\n",
      "\n",
      "Because advancing equity in society requires transformation of complex systems, our strategies in arenas such as economic mobility, racial equity and human rights in supply chains involve long-term, intensive collaboration with others on business and philanthropic initiatives extending beyond the four walls of our company.\n",
      "\n",
      "Substantial improvements in outcomes may be years in the making.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yet we are encouraged by emerging shifts in mindsets, practices, resource flows and policies within each of these arenas as well as progress within our own company.\n",
      "\n",
      "Climate action: more than promises.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the lead up to COP26 in Glasgow, many companies set goals to help the world get to net-zero emissions.\n",
      "\n",
      "Walmart has been engaging in climate action since 2005 and enlisting suppliers to do the same since the launch of Project Gigaton™ in 2017.\n",
      "\n",
      "This year we reported that we continue to make progress toward our science-based targets for emissions reduction (for example, reporting a 17.5% reduction in FY2021 relative to our 2015 baseline for Scope 1 and 2 emissions) and we significantly expanded our efforts and disclosures related to our nature goals.\n",
      "\n",
      "No simple solutions.\n",

      "When it comes to complex societal issues, stakeholders don’t always agree on the way forward and there can be many obstacles to progress.\n",

      "Investors have asked businesses for more consistent and relevant ESG information.\n",
