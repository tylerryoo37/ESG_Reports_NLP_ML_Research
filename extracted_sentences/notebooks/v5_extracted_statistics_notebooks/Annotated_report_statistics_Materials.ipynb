      "4 Linde 2020 Sustainable Development Report Dear Stakeholder, Our mission statement making our world more productive is perfectly aligned with society's increasing focus on sustainability. This report illustrates how, at Linde, 75,000 employees in nearly one hundred countries strive every day to bring our mission to life. Last year, Linde announced a new set of targets in strategic areas of environment, social and governance (ESG). These included 10- year climate change targets, and I am pleased to share that we are well ahead of meeting these goals. As part of our commitment to increase decarbonization investments, we have announced several large projects including a multi-purpose green hydrogen plant in Germany, to supply, amongst others, the world’s first operational hydrogen-powered ferry. We have already lowered our greenhouse gas emissions intensity by 16 percent from 2018, toward a goal of 35 percent reduction by 2028, and increased our procurement of low- carbon and renewable electricity. It has only been one year since we announced our targets, and Linde employees are delivering on those targets just as they do in the areas of safety, reliability and productivity. But that is not enough – we will soon be issuing more aggressive GHG emissions reduction targets. Enabling our customers’ sustainability goals is also a priority. Our products help our customers reduce their carbon footprint and provide positive environmental impact to communities. In 2020, we helped to avoid 85 million metric tons of equivalent CO₂ emissions and enabled more than 200 million people to have access to safe drinking water. We are also reducing the environmental burden of communities where we operate: More than 100 sites joined our global Zero Waste program, diverting approximately 150 million pounds of waste from landfill, and our water management planning has helped reduce Linde's water use by 300 million gallons. Lastly, our employees performed over 300 projects in their communities addressing basic human needs such as education, shelter, hygiene and nutrition. As COVID-19 overwhelmed healthcare facilities around the world, our local teams took extraordinary measures to deliver essential medical oxygen under challenging conditions. This pandemic also exposed inequities in our society. In response, we expanded our Global Giving Program to over $10 million providing additional funding to organizations addressing social justice issues. Diversity and inclusion remain top priorities in our company and we expect to exceed our goal of 30 percent female representation globally by 2030. Linde continues to be recognized for excellence in sustainability performance: For example, Linde is a member of the FTSE4Good Index Series, and the company has been included within the Dow Jones Sustainability Index for 18 consecutive years – unique among companies in the chemicals sector. I am proud of what we have accomplished and am excited about the future. I fully expect the Linde team to continue our tradition of excellence as we strive to make a difference for our customers and our communities. Stay safe! \"I fully expect the Linde team to seek new ways to expand our impact and to continue Linde’s tradition of excellence as we strive to make a difference for our customers and our communities.\" Steve Angel Chief Executive Officer Message from our CEO 102-14\n",

      "6 Linde 2020 Sustainable Development Report About Linde Mission, Vision and Values Linde's Sustainable Development Report (SDR) demonstrates how we deliver on our mission of making our world more productive. We live our mission every day by providing high-quality solutions, technologies and services that are making our customers more successful and helping to sustain and protect our planet. Our vision is to be the best performing global industrial gases and engineering company, where our people deliver innovative and sustainable solutions for our customers in a connected world. Linde’s values are safety, integrity, community, inclusion and accountability. Ethics and Integrity 102-16 Responsible corporate governance is a key prerequisite for Linde’s business success. This means ensuring compliance with the law, rules and regulations, and voluntary commitments. Linde strives continuously to achieve its goals ethically and with the highest integrity. Interaction between management, employees and Linde’s business partners is expected to be transparent and respectful, consistent with our Code of Business Integrity (CBI). Linde’s governance of Ethics and Integrity is described in management approach for Material Economic Aspects, page 39. Organization Linde is a leading global industrial gases and engineering company with 2020 sales of $27 billion. The reporting currency is the U.S. dollar. All amounts are shown in U.S. dollars ($), unless stated otherwise. The company employs approximately 75,000 people globally and serves a diverse group of industries across more than 100 countries. Approximately 83 percent of Linde’s 2020 sales were generated from industrial gases operations in three geographic segments – Americas; Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA); and Asia Pacific (APAC). The remaining 17 percent is related primarily to the Engineering segment, and to a lesser extent, other operating segments (including the Praxair Surface Technologies business, a wholly owned subsidiary). Business Model 102-2, 102-9 Linde’s business model is to transform air and other process gases into applications that, in many cases, help customers become more energy and resource efficient or provide social benefits. Linde’s industrial gas processes transform natural resources into environmental and social value and impact; see the Business Model table, page 8. Principal business operations are to make atmospheric gases from raw materials in the air and electricity, and process gases, mainly hydrogen, from natural gas or industry byproducts, together with steam. The outputs of these processes, or our product applications, serve multiple end markets. More than 65 percent of sales are underpinned by fixed fees or resilient end-markets (e.g., healthcare, food and beverage, electronics, as well as portions of sales to chemicals and refining, metals and manufacturing), which provides some protection from market swings. Many of Linde's applications bring environmental, economic and social benefits to our customers, communities and the planet. Our \"sustainability portfolio\" applications are shown in the \"Outputs\" rows, by end market. The benefits that they enable are shown in the \"Outcomes\" rows, by gas. For example, Linde’s oxygen helps steelmakers save energy, allows sustainable aquaculture to thrive and serves hundreds of thousands of patients needing respiratory oxygen. Its hydrogen helps oil refiners to make ultra-low sulfur diesel (ULSD), which helps improve air quality; thereby improving the environment and human health. Linde's high-performance surface coatings help improve energy efficiency in jet engines and machine turbines. These outcomes deliver multiple longer-term impacts and sustainable business value. For more information about the company’s business model and products and services, please visit http://www.linde.com/. Creating Economic, Environmental and Social Value Linde’s business model creates additional enduring value that amplifies our mission of making our world more productive. The Business Model table shows a range of Linde’s inputs and activities, (1) Total sales excluding Linde Engineering ���������� �� ��� �� ��� ��� ��� ��� ��� ��� ��� ��� ��� ������������� �������������������� ������ ����������� �������� �������������� ��������������������� �������������������� ����������������� ������������ ��������������� ������ ����������� ����� ����������������� �����������\n",
      "7 Linde 2020 Sustainable Development Report and the output and outcomes of these beyond those described in our Business Model table. For example, Linde values the safety of its employees and contractors and invests more than 5 million hours of safety training each year. One outcome of this effort is that Linde’s safety record is several times better than industry benchmarks, which gives us confidence that our employees and contractors return home safely at the end of their day. Linde’s products contribute positively to the health and wellbeing of our customers. Homecare and hospital patients worldwide benefit from our medical gases, devices, services and therapies, especially in respiratory care. For example, during the COVID-19 pandemic, Linde medical oxygen was crucial to healthcare responders and their patients in many of our countries. In the United States, Lincare is a leading provider of home respiratory-therapy products and services. Linde gases also play an important role in tackling the global challenge of access to clean water. An ever-growing population and industrial activity, along with stringent environmental regulations, puts additional pressure on wastewater treatment plants across the globe to treat increasing volumes of wastewater - adding pure oxygen effectively increases plant capacity. As access to drinking water becomes more scarce, the market for desalination has expanded, particularly in drought-susceptible areas. Carbon dioxide can be used in the re-mineralization step, as a safer alternative to mineral acids. In Australia, for example, Linde CO₂ helps desalinate water to meet the needs of 15 percent of the population in Sydney. In 2020, Linde gases enabled more than 200 million people to have access to safe drinking water, including approximately 140 million people in APAC. The long-term impact of these activities is difficult to measure or attribute directly to one company. However, we can demonstrate how they contribute to the 17 global United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (UN SDGs) introduced by the UN to eradicate poverty, protect the planet and guarantee prosperity for all by 2030. The \"Impact\" column of the table on page 9, shows the SDGs most relevant to Linde, which are referenced in Linde’s Sustainable Development targets. There are many examples of how Linde's activities contribute towards the SDGs, including efforts to further SDG 12: Responsible Production and Consumption. SDG 12.2 is \"By 2030, achieve the sustainable management and efficient use of natural resources.\" Linde's broad range of resource intensity targets address this issue. The company also takes direct action on SDG 12.6: \"Encourage companies, especially large and transnational companies, to adopt sustainable practices and to integrate sustainability information into their reporting cycle.\" In the table we can observe, for instance, how Linde contributes to SDG 7.2: \"Increase the share of renewable energy by 2030\"; Linde will actively contribute to this target by doubling the purchase of low-carbon energy by 2028 (please refer to page 20 for more details on this target).\n",

      "11 Linde 2020 Sustainable Development Report Sustainable Development Targets 2028 102-47 Linde’s ambitious Sustainable Development 2028 (SD 2028) targets are our roadmap and plan for the coming years. The targets are organized in four categories or Priority Factors (PFs) that we consider relevant to the company and its internal and external stakeholders: Climate Change; Safety, Health & Environment; People & Community; and Integrity & Compliance. The PFs are shown in the box: Priority Factors. Within the four PFs are 10 subset areas, covering 20 targets. The Climate Change targets span Linde’s full value chain, from pre- investment and R&D to operations, customers and growth strategy. These are discussed in the Climate Change section. Our PF for Safety, Health & Environment is supported by targets for personnel safety, distribution safety and product safety, and in the environment area, for sustainable productivity, water and waste. The People & Community PF has targets for diversity and inclusion, community engagement and global giving. In the Integrity & Compliance category, we are targeting 100 percent of employees and contractors certified in our code of ethics and compliance. This set of targets has several features worth noting: 1. They are 10-year targets that set a long-term strategy for sustainable development at Linde. They are consistent with Linde’s business model, its mission and values and the strategic business objectives named by the Board as a basis for variable compensation. 2. Linde’s businesses and functions are accountable to deliver these targets – they are embedded into our businesses and operations. Each target is a business KPI and managed as part of the business. 3. The targets were developed with reference to external expectations. These include ESG investors, who look for non- financial information as the basis to make better informed investor decisions, such as the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB). They were also developed with stakeholders interested in understanding Linde’s impacts within the context of global needs and planetary boundaries (such as described by the GRI Sustainability Reporting Standards and the UN SDGs). Our SD targets contribute to several SDGs, as shown in the table on value creation on page 9, and in the Targets table. Linde publishes indexes that show how its SD strategy and targets align with the GRI Standards, TCFD and with SASB; and an ESG Report – Summary for Investors. For more information please visit: https://www.linde. com/about-linde/sustainable-development/reporting-center. 4. As part of its continuous improvement process, Linde conducts a condensed SDMA each year to confirm alignment and consider adjustments and improvements. The SDMA will be repeated after 5 years to confirm that the key issues remain relevant. The full SDMA process is described on our website at: https://www.linde. com/sustainable-development/selecting-priorities.

      "13 Linde 2020 Sustainable Development Report The effects of climate change are increasingly visible on the environment, society and the global economy. Climate change is not a distant threat — it is happening now. Linde has the technology, resources and people to help address climate change. For more than 100 years, we have been providing solutions to help solve global energy challenges. Our company’s mission of making our world more productive is fully aligned with the goals of addressing the global challenges of sustainable energy and climate change. Through our high-quality solutions, products, technologies and services, we are making our customers more successful and helping to sustain and protect our planet. TODAY Linde is in the business of resource transformation. We use fuels for energy and as feedstock. Our business and production processes are therefore energy-intensive, making the cost and availability of energy important for Linde. Our total carbon footprint in 2020 was about 37.2 million tons of CO₂e, where 44 percent stems from direct carbon dioxide emissions, mostly from our hydrogen plants, and 56 percent from indirect emissions from our electricity consumption, mostly from air separation. This energy use, in turn, delivers innovative and sustainable solutions for our customers. In many cases, these solutions improve the productivity, energy use and GHG emissions for our customers or end users. In fact, we calculate that in 2020, Linde gases, principally oxygen and hydrogen, enabled our customers to avoid 85 million metric tons of CO₂e, which is more than twice as much GHG avoided than emitted from all our operations. See page 14. As the electric grid decarbonizes by using more low-carbon and renewable sources, Linde’s indirect GHG emissions will reduce. In addition, Linde actively contributes to grid decarbonization in multiple ways: • Linde’s business proposition is that it is more reliable and more energy efficient for our customers to outsource the production of industrial gases than to insource. Linde’s energy efficiency is world-class, and we continue to improve it each year, saving money as well as energy and GHG emissions. • Many of Linde’s cryogenic air separation (ASU) plants are designed to include “buffer” inventories to retain reliable supply in case of power failure. This has allowed Linde to participate in demand- response programs. In periods of peak energy demand, Linde can interrupt its grid power use and effectively reduce grid electric load (by the equivalent of 40,000 homes from a single location). Linde’s design investment can provide ancillary service for grid operators to maintain reliable electric power service as wind and solar energy become a greater part of our resource mix. • Thirty-four percent of all Linde energy (16.4 TWh) is currently sourced from low-carbon and renewable power. Of that, 2.5 TWh is directly or actively sourced — equivalent to the annual electricity use of approximately 287,000 homes in the U.S. Linde electricity use in the UK and Brazil is almost 100 percent renewable, using wind and hydroelectric, respectively. Other low-carbon sources are hydro and nuclear power in New York state, wind and hydro in Mexico, and wind in India. Hydrogen is a key enabler of the clean energy transition. It is a versatile, clean and safe energy carrier that can be used as fuel for power or in the industry as feedstock. At the point of use, it produces zero emissions and it can be stored and transported at high energy density in liquid or gaseous form. It can be combusted or used in fuel cells to generate heat and electricity. We are at the beginning of this transition. Conventional processes are dominant today in refining, chemical production and other manufacturing processes (steel, electronics and other applications). R&D and emerging technologies are starting to change the landscape, but hydrogen fuel cell vehicles (HFCVs) are not yet widely adopted, green fuels and materials are still at pilot stages and hydrogen for energy storage is still in the development stage. Most hydrogen is produced by steam methane reforming (SMR) using natural gas, or recovered as a byproduct from other industrial processes. Water electrolysis is emerging as an effective low-carbon source of hydrogen production, but SMRs remain the dominant technology to produce hydrogen at a large scale. Climate Change—Challenge & Opportunity\n",
      "14 Linde 2020 Sustainable Development Report 10.9 million MT CO2e avoided from coatings for thermal barriers for industrial gas turbine and jet engine efficiency Values are based on 2020 reported and consolidated results from Linde plc subsidiaries following Linde plc reporting standards. CO2e = CO2 equivalents Linde is a company in the business of resource transformation in a world that is dealing with climate change. Below are our 2020 actual results as reported by Linde plc entities. We demonstrate that a subset of Linde applications allow our customers or their end users to avoid more than twice the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of all Linde operations. In 2020, total GHG emissions were 37.2 million MT CO2e, versus 85 million MT CO2e avoided by our customers or end users, from several applications shown below – 2.3x the GHG benefit created than depleted. 5.1 million MT CO2e avoided from Kr in windows and Ar in welding 58.5 million MT CO2e avoided from H2 for ultra-low sulfur diesel (ULSD) 0 37.2 million MT CO2e Linde GHG footprint 85 million MT CO2e benefits enabled by Linde applications for customers and end users In 2020, a subset of Linde applications enabled more than twice the GHG benefit than was emitted in all global operations. 10.5 million MT CO2e avoided from O2 for steelmaking Linde Applications Enable 2.3x Carbon Productivity 21 million MT CO2e Scope 2 indirect GHG emissions emitted mainly from air separation 16.2 million MT CO₂e Scope 1 GHG emissions: 10.6 million MT from hydrogen production, 5.6 million from other GHG emissions, driving and natural gas use\n",
      "15 Linde 2020 Sustainable Development Report Hydrogen is the most abundant element in the universe. Even though it’s light and small, hydrogen is a powerful energy carrier. For example, it can be used to store excess renewable energy. Hydrogen is transported underground through an extensive network of pipelines or overland by truck to be applied to a wide range of applications, from mobility to heavy industries. Due to its versatility, hydrogen is proving to be a key enabler of the transition to low and zero-carbon energy – clean energy, to help meet climate change targets. At Linde, we have been harnessing the power of hydrogen for over 100 years and are making continued investments in effective and economic ways to deliver gray, blue and, ultimately, green hydrogen. We can produce hydrogen from a range of feedstocks and natural resources. Using processes like steam reforming, we generate gray hydrogen from natural gas, liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) or naphtha. This is the most common hydrogen production process today. Gray hydrogen can be converted into blue hydrogen by adding carbon capture and storage technologies to the production process. Green hydrogen can be produced using electrolysis powered by renewable energy. An alternative green hydrogen production method is steam methane reforming using biomass as feedstock. Gray and blue hydrogen are important steppingstones on the path to green hydrogen as they allow the necessary frameworks and infrastructures to be developed while green hydrogen production reaches the necessary scale. As one of the world’s leading industrial gases and engineering companies, Linde covers the full spectrum of the hydrogen value chain. We can help customers and industry stakeholders navigate through the complexities of the transition to a zero-carbon economy. Our engineers work with customers in identifying their path to zero emissions and can provide support in designing, building and operating plants and facilities. Clean hydrogen is a cornerstone of our clean energy strategy comprised of 1) providing solutions to manage carbon emissions, and 2) clean hydrogen development. We are aligned with the Paris Agreement and contribute to accelerating the transition to a clean energy economy. We also support the Task Force on Climate Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) – an Index showing the alignment between Linde’s reporting and the TCFD Guidelines is available at: https://www.linde.com/about-linde/sustainabledevelopment/ reportingcenter. Advocacy is another way in which we actively drive the transition to clean energy: Linde is a founding member of the Hydrogen Council and participates in many other hydrogen and climate change forums and advocacy groups, such as the Sustainable Markets Initiative and the Hydrogen Forward coalition. Today, Linde has the largest liquid hydrogen production capacity and distribution system in the world. We also operate the world's first commercial high-purity hydrogen storage cavern, coupled with an unrivaled pipeline network of approximately 1,000 kilometers to reliably supply our customers. With close to 200 hydrogen refueling stations and 80 hydrogen electrolysis plants worldwide, we are at the forefront of the energy transition. Leading the Transition to Clean Hydrogen Linde’s Capabilities Across the Hydrogen Value Chain\n",
      "16 Linde 2020 Sustainable Development Report Linde's Roadmap to 2028 In 2028, the target horizon for our 10-year managed climate objectives will end. Our assumptions for this time horizon are that industrial-level decarbonization continues to accelerate. New technologies will be piloted and scaled commercially. Green fuels and materials will be scaling and the feasibility for hydrogen usage as an agent of decarbonization in multiple applications will be growing. SMRs will continue to be used for most large-scale hydrogen production. They will be more efficient, and many will incorporate carbon capture or use feedstocks and power from renewable sources. Electrolysis for green hydrogen production from renewable power will be available at capacities greater than 100 MW. Linde's six climate change targets through 2028 (with a 2018 baseline) follow the full value chain from investment to customer and planetary benefits. They are consistent with Linde’s mission and are critical to continuing the company's leadership in sustainability. These are management targets; our businesses are accountable for achieving them, and they are part of our compensation structure. Linde will invest more than $1 billion in decarbonization initiatives and triple the amount of clean hydrogen production. The company is investing across the hydrogen value chain to accelerate the clean energy transition with a higher global renewable power mix and significant operating and capital efficiencies. We will pursue competitive low-carbon sources of hydrogen, including energy- efficient SMRs with carbon dioxide capture, electrolysis with renewable power and piloting new low-carbon technologies. In the R&D decarbonization focus area, key projects include advanced thermal barrier coatings and advanced sealing technologies, improving global plant efficiency, energy optimization, logistics and operations optimization, and flexible operations to support demand-side management and allow for higher utilization of renewably produced electrical power. It also includes the development of alternative gas separation technologies to allow alternative process concepts with higher efficiency and a lower carbon dioxide footprint; and decarbonization of the integrated mill, heat recovery, direct reduced iron technologies and electrochemistry initiatives. Not all barriers to decarbonization can be overcome in the short term. However, we can continue to invest in optimizing operational efficiency, and we are making a commitment to a substantial increase in low-carbon and renewable energy to continue reducing carbon emissions. The target of 35 percent improvement in Linde GHG intensity 2018– 2028 is measured against adjusted EBITDA*. This target was chosen in order to show efficiency against a business denominator. EBITDA is one of the non-GAAP measures reported by Linde plc. Achieving this target will depend on a range of external variables that are not in our control, from global economic trends to government regulations to currency fluctuations. We remain committed to managing business growth while optimizing operational GHG emissions. In 2020, Linde reduced its GHG intensity by 16.5 percent; see Performance Towards Targets. In relation to Scope 1 or direct GHG emissions, we target improving Scope 1 GHG intensity for hydrogen plants (HyCOs) (4 percent improvement within the target horizon) and our distribution vehicles (10 percent) and reducing our absolute GHG emissions from other sources (e.g., refrigerant filling losses, nitrous oxide emissions) by 10 * Scope 1 and 2 emissions (in Million MT) divided by adjusted EBITDA in billion USD. Calculation for 2018 uses adjusted pro forma EBITDA. Calculation for 2019 onward uses adjusted EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP measure. For definition and reconciliation, please see Appendix to the Investor Teleconference Presentation Fourth Quarter 2020.

      "17 Linde 2020 Sustainable Development Report percent. In relation to Scope 2 or indirect GHG emissions, Linde aims to improve its operational efficiency and GHG intensity at ASU plants (7 percent within the target horizon). Linde's largest medium-term opportunity to affect its GHG footprint is in Scope 2 electricity. We continue to leverage our scale and geographic distribution to procure reliable and affordable sources of renewable electricity through active procurement of new direct renewable energy contracts, Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs) or Renewable Energy Credits (RECs). By 2028, we expect to have achieved: • 35 percent improvement in GHG intensity versus EBITDA – from 5.2 to 3.2 • Hold Scope 2 GHG emissions flat or reduced at the same time as we substantially increase our power use • More than 2x low-carbon power procured • Overall, renewable energy and low-carbon energy sources are projected to increase from 35 percent to more than 50 percent (all power) We are committed to setting a science-based target within the next year. Linde has joined the SBT Chemicals Stakeholder Advisory Group, which is the working group that is developing guidance for the chemicals sector. (More information is available at: https:// sciencebasedtargets.org/companies-taking-action/.) We have implemented several additional measures to help us better manage our carbon footprint, achieve our long-term targets, and assess the long-term risks of climate change. Linde's Clean Hydrogen organization was launched to focus and accelerate activity in this area. The GHG emissions from new investments are calculated and integrated into considerations in Capital Investment Committee decisions for every project. They are then considered in the selection of the technology solution and project risks across the project development cycle. To help mitigate potential physical risks from climate change, Linde has developed a tool to explore future climate change scenarios that could impose additional operational costs on production processes from factors like higher ambient temperature or air quality deterioration/higher carbon dioxide parts per million (PPMs) in the atmosphere at our locations. BEYOND: Bold, Achievable Impact Linde recognizes the degree of its stakeholders' interest in climate change and the importance of impact globally. As such, the company is continually assessing its targets and planning execution scenarios for even more far-reaching targets, to which the company can confidently commit. The world is at the brink of an energy transformation. The long- term effects of carbon-based fuels on the environment and climate require significant changes to the energy supply chain. We can envision a future where hydrogen fuel cells will be widely adopted; green electricity will be available commercially; and energy and fuel markets will be linked. Low-carbon hydrogen will be cost- competitive; SMRs will feature additional energy efficiency and carbon capture; and electrolysis will be available with renewable electricity sources at much greater capacities and will supply a significant share of new hydrogen demand. Tackling climate change is a shared and global responsibility. Linde plans to participate in the investments and technologies that will reduce global GHG emissions. We are proudly active in advancing the world towards the ambitious target of the IEA Beyond 2 Degrees Scenario (B2DS) and its required GHG pathway for the chemical industry. Achieving this objective will require changes in societal behaviors, government regulation, industry engagement and technology development. As a leading industrial gases and engineering company, we have the technology, resources and capability to contribute across all aspects of managing climate change and reducing GHG emissions.\n",
      "18 Linde 2020 Sustainable Development Report Linde’s 2028 Sustainable Development (SD 2028) targets set a long-term, 10-year action plan with commitments from leadership and all levels of the organization. These are managed targets with clear accountability, ongoing reporting to management, and an annual process of review and continuous improvement. These target areas are consistent with Linde’s strategic non-financial business objectives considered in determining executive variable compensation awards. Performance against this full slate of targets is reported quarterly to executive leadership, and at least once a year to the full Board of Directors. Operational performance towards targets is reported on a monthly basis to management. Linde began providing ESG performance results versus its climate change targets in 2020, the only chemicals company on the DAX and S&P 500 to report quarterly ESG performance against its targets. Most targets run from the 2018 base year, the first year of our combined company, for 10 years to 2028.

Since 2018, Linde has invested a cumulative $128 million. In 2020, Linde also approved an investment in the largest electrolyzer globally (24MW). This is projected to be operational in mid-2022. • Direct at least a third of Linde’s annual R&D budget to decarbonization The scope includes annual spend to develop lower-carbon technology for Linde assets or to develop lower-carbon solutions for our customers. Linde invested 26 percent of its 2020 R&D budget ($184 million) into decarbonization (2019: 25 percent). Initiatives include developing industry-leading carbon capture technologies, investing in promising green hydrogen technologies and driving operational efficiency to further reduce GHG intensity. • Contribute more than 50 percent of revenue from our Sustainability Portfolio The scope is annual Linde revenue associated with the sale of gases in applications that bring environmental and/or social benefits; see the Business Model table. In 2020, Linde generated 54 percent of revenue, or $13 billion, from its Sustainability Portfolio. The Sustainability Portfolio includes sales from Linde’s eco-portfolio ($8.3 billion) and social portfolio ($4.8 billion) — numbers do not sum because of some overlap. The eco-portfolio includes applications that have environmental and social benefits, such as oxygen for blast furnaces in steel; hydrogen for utra-low sulfur diesel (ULSD); and oxygen and carbon dioxide for wastewater treatment, desalination and aquaculture. The social portfolio included applications with targeted social benefits. Examples are oxygen for respiratory care and helium for MRI technology. For the eco-portfolio, R&D developed a simplified Life Cycle Assessment (LCA)-based screening methodology to determine and update which applications are included. A simplified LCA includes part of the four stages of a product lifecycle of raw material acquisition, manufacturing, use/reuse/maintenance and recycle/waste management (e.g., it assesses one or two of the stages completely, or analyzes all four stages to lesser depth). All (100 percent) of Linde’s products under development were evaluated in-depth in the first three stages (e.g., cradle to grave). For environmental impacts, we use Environmental Key Performance Indicators (EKPIs): energy (electricity, natural gas and fuel); air emissions and direct and indirect GHG emissions; waste (hazardous and non-hazardous); water; and ozone depleting substances (ODSs). • Enable >2X more GHG to be avoided per year than are emitted in all Linde operations The scope is GHG benefits from a subset of Linde applications that enable demonstrable GHG benefits, versus Linde’s 2020 total direct and indirect (Scopes 1 and 2) GHG emissions. In 2020, a subset of its applications enabled 85 million MT CO₂e to be avoided — 47.8 million MT more than its GHG emissions or 2.3x times more. See “Linde Applications Enable 2.3x Carbon Productivity.” Methodology: End-user avoided carbon dioxide emissions are calculated in accordance with the International Council of Chemical Associations (ICCA) guidelines. Avoided emissions arise from efforts by multiple partners along the respective value chains. Linde’s contribution has been characterized as fundamental in enabling the\n",

See \"Addressing the Avoided Emissions Challenge: Guidelines from the chemical industry for accounting for and reporting greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions avoided along the value chain based on comparative studies,\" ICCA October, 2003 (updated 2017), at: https://icca-chem.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/ICCA-2017_ Addressing_guidelines_WEB.pdf. Optimize Operational Energy Use and GHG Emissions Linde’s 2020 Scope 1 GHG emissions were 16.2 MM MT CO₂e. This represents a 1 percent absolute reduction, driven by lower hydrogen production due to the pandemic, improved HyCO GHG efficiency. Results were also impacted by increased direct emissions resulting from facilities and the startup of several new plants. Scope 1 GHG emissions were caused mainly (65 percent) by hydrogen production in SMRs. An additional 18 percent Scope 1 emissions were caused by “other” sources of GHG (e.g., nitrous oxide or other plants); 13 percent from air separation, where air separation units (ASUs) are run on natural gas; and 4 percent from driving. Targets to improve GHG intensity in hydrogen production, other GHG emissions, and driving address. Linde’s Scope 2 GHG emissions were 21 MM MT CO₂e. This represents a 6 percent absolute reduction versus 2019, driven by improvements in plant specific grid emission factors; increased low-carbon (LC) and renewable power purchases; and lower production due to the pandemic, as well as updated methodology for Scope 2 emissions from steam. Scope 2 GHG were caused by the use of electricity and steam, a portion of which comes from fossil fuel sources. Electricity is principally (90 percent) used by air separation plants and is tracked with the air separation energy efficiency target. An additional 5 percent of the electricity is used in hydrogen production. Targets to improve energy efficiency in ASUs and to increase low-carbon sourcing address this issue. In order to show efficiency against a business denominator, Linde selected EBITDA, which is one of the non-GAAP measures reported by Linde plc. It reflects the size of the business for which the emissions are being reported and the efficiency improvements that are being targeted. Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP measure. For definition and reconciliation, please see Appendix to the Investor Teleconference Presentation Fourth Quarter 2020. Linde’s 2020 adjusted EBITDA was $8.6 billion. • Achieve 35 percent GHG intensity improvement versus EBITDA The scope is Linde’s combined Scope 1 + Scope 2 GHG emissions versus EBITDA. In 2020, Linde’s GHG intensity was 4.3 MMT CO₂e/$ billion, representing 16.5 percent GHG intensity improvement over 2018, resulting from lower production volumes due to the pandemic and increased renewable energy availability and sourcing. • Achieve 7 percent improvement in ASU energy intensity The scope is Linde ASU facilities worldwide where Linde pays for the power and has operational control, including 50 percent at-equity joint ventures. The 2020 results represented a decline versus 2019, from 0.6 percent cumulative reduction to 0.5 percent cumulative reduction. This is contributed due to lower production volumes resulting from the pandemic. Total cumulative improvement relative to the baseline is 0.5 percent. This was achieved through targeted productivity efforts and capital investments, along with the startup of large plants incorporating state-of-the-art ASU equipment and processes. See GRI 302-1 for information on electricity consumption, GRI 302-3 for energy intensity, and GRI 302-4 for energy reduction activities. • Achieve 4 percent improvement in hydrogen GHG intensity The scope is Linde hydrogen facilities worldwide. The 2020 results were a 7.1 percent improvement versus 2018 (4 percent YOY). Performance against this target was not expected to be linear. It reflects both lower production volumes due to the pandemic and the effect of project startups over this period, the implementation of projected technology innovations as well as an increase in byproduct hydrogen sourced. • Achieve 10 percent Improvement in trucking GHG emissions intensity The scope is all Linde commercial driving operations (bulk and packaged gases combined) where the driver is a Linde employee. The 2020 results were a 7.22 percent GHG intensity improvement. The target is calculated by multiplying the number of miles driven and fuel used in each geography by GHG emissions factors and dividing by volume of product delivered. The 2020 performance was driven by improvements in packaged gas distribution and network optimization; operational efficiencies; better planning and scheduling to reduce kilometers per delivery; and improved vehicle technologies for fuel efficiency. Overall results also reflect changes in distribution patterns due to the pandemic. Contractor driving is reported as Scope 3 at GRI 305-3. • Achieve a 10 percent absolute reduction in other GHG emissions The scope is most “other GHG emissions” from a range of Scope 1 GHG emissions sources, calculated into CO₂ equivalents. In 2020, these emissions were 1.5 MM MT CO₂e (2019: 1.7). 2020 results were a 9.3 percent improvement over the baseline. This performance improvement was achieved by defining and improving best practices, particularly in U.S. electronics and reductions in refrigerants due to improved reporting. Other GHG emissions within this target are from refrigerant losses from cylinder refilling operations; nitrous oxide (N₂O) emissions from N₂O plants and cylinder filling; and methane releases from helium and CO₂ plants, which account for most of Linde’s other GHG emissions. • >2x low-carbon power sourcing (to >30TWh), primarily from active renewable electricity The scope is all Linde operations within our GHG reporting boundary. In 2020, the company sourced 16 million MWh low-carbon energy, or 39 percent of all its purchased electricity. Low-carbon electricity is defined as electricity produced from non-fossil sources including renewables (e.g., solar, wind, biomass, geothermal, hydro and other low-carbon [e.g., nuclear]). The target includes passive electricity (e.g., from the grid) and active sourcing over PPAs, RECs, certificates and sourcing contracts for specific facilities. It considers all energy consumption where Linde purchases the electricity. It excludes electricity where Linde is not the purchaser. Linde actively sourced 2.4 TWh renewable energy in 2020. Linde electricity use in the UK is almost 100 percent renewable using wind. Renewable electricity is also sourced in New York state, Colombia, India, Spain, Philippines and other geographies.\n"

All three programs are baselined with 2018 data from legacy Praxair only. In 2019, reported performance for sustainable productivity and zero waste decreased from 2018 due to the full year impact of 2018 divestitures and the mid-year launch of the global initiative. In 2020, we start to see results for the full Linde plc organization. • Save $1.3 billion from sustainable productivity Sustainable productivity projects bring financial and environmental savings in Linde's EKPIs. The target for sustainable productivity is a cumulative savings of $1.3 billion, 2018-2028. The 2020 results are on track to meet this target. Linde achieved savings of $133 million (cumulatively $310 million), or 15 percent of all productivity savings. Environmental protection costs in 2020 included approximately $13 million in capital expenditures and $42 million of expenses. The scope is all Linde operations. Sustainable productivity also saved 816 million KWh, 1,400 billion BTU, 3.2 million gallons of diesel fuel, approximately 8 million pounds of waste, 300 million gallons of water and 576,000 MT CO₂e. CO₂e savings count projects where benefits are fully realized and projects that were implemented in 2020 and are still accruing benefits. Based on our experience with rolling out this program at Praxair over almost a decade from 2010, the target assumes that both reported financial savings, and their percentage contribution to all productivity, will increase from the early years of the target period, before achieving a steady state in later years. • Implement Water Management Plans (WMPs) at high-water use sites in areas of water stress The scope is high-water use (hi-hi) sites, defined as sites exceeding 50,000 m³/ year of water withdrawal, excluding once-through, non- contacting cooling water. The 2020 results are on track to meet this target: Sixty-seven sites were defined as in scope for this target in 2020, a threefold increase from 2019. WMPs were implemented at 20 percent of applicable sites. Areas of water stress are defined by the World Business Council on Sustainable Development (WBCSD) (2015 version)/ WRI Aqueduct Global Water Risk Atlas Tool (2019 version). We determined “high stress” to mean that the baseline water stress was “high” or “extremely high”. In addition, businesses are encouraged to voluntarily use local determinants of water risk; sites thus defined are included in this target scope. Most of the water Linde uses is for cooling systems and for the production of steam for the steam methane reforming process to make hydrogen. Net freshwater consumption was 93.1 million m³. In 2020, Linde completed target scoping and criteria definition across Linde plc. To enhance data quality and visibility, Linde converted its water reporting from quarterly to monthly reporting for sites with WMPs. The number of total sites in scope increased from 22 to 67. Nine of these are sites added voluntarily in Latin America South and APAC, based on local knowledge of high water stress. Three of the 2019 sites were excluded from the 2020 scope based on new scoping criteria. Of the 67 sites determined to be in scope, 20 percent implemented WMPs by the end of 2020. In addition to the voluntary sites in Brazil (8) and Thailand (1), the remaining WMP sites are in EMEA (31), APAC (13), U.S. (9), Mexico (2) and South Latin America (3). South Latin America voluntarily adopted a target to reduce absolute water volume by 1 percent by 2020. They have achieved this voluntary target for 4 consecutive years. At the end of 2020, they achieved an overall water reduction of more than 2,125,834 m³ – a cumulative reduction of 52.3 percent, compared to its baseline. Investments were made to re-use rainwater and to condensate the water from thawing liquid vehicles hoses, and use it as make-up water at refrigeration towers. • SD 2028 Target: >450 sites achieve Zero Waste to Landfill\n",
      "22 Linde 2020 Sustainable Development Report The scope is all Linde operations. At the end of 2020, 286 sites achieved Zero Waste to Landfill. A Zero Waste to Landfill site is defined as one that diverts more than 90 percent process waste from landfills; this can include incineration for energy recovery. Altogether, 514 sites participated, and approximately 150 million pounds of waste was diverted from landfills. Zero Waste to Landfill helps extend our company’s mission and values and promotes circular economic practices. In many cases, the program brings social benefits to local communities, from education to job creation. See GRI 306-2 for more information on waste metrics. In addition to Linde facilities, six regional offices retained their external recognitions for greening their offices: Bangalore, India; Seoul, Korea; Burr Ridge, Illinois; The Woodlands, Texas; Danbury, Connecticut; and Tonawanda, New York. See the Green Seal website at: https://greenseal.org/programs/green-office-partnership. Safety & Health During 2020, Linde continued to align its safety and environmental standards and procedures for both work processes and product handling to enable employees around the world to execute their jobs safely and to prevent safety incidents relating to operational processes or products. Linde’s Safety SD 2028 targets include two for operational safety, one for distribution safety and one for product safety. • Annually achieve operational safety better than Industry Levels for Lost Workday Case Rate (LWCR) and Total Recordable Case Rate (TRCR). The scope of these targets are all Linde operations (e.g., for employees and contractors). Lost Workday Case Rate (LWCR): Linde’s 2020 LWCR was 0.21 (2019: 0.23), more than four times better than the OSHA all industries industrial average (0.9). Linde’s LWCR is defined as the number of Recordable Injury Cases (RIC) plus the number of Recordable Sickness Cases (RSC) that result in one or more day(s) away from work as a result of a work-related incident or exposure per 200,000 hours worked (for employees and contractors). Total Recordable Case Rate (TRCR): Linde’s 2020 TRCR (the number of employee or contractor recordable injuries per 200,000 hours worked) was 0.51 (2019: 0.57). Linde’s 2020 TRCR was more than five times better than the OSHA all industries industrial average (2.8). A recordable case is defined as any recordable injury or sickness of an employee, temporary worker or contractor that results from a work- related incident or exposure per 200,000 hours worked. • Annually achieve Commercial Vehicle Incident Rate (CVIR) of <2.5/ million kilometers The scope is all operations and all employee and contractor commercial vehicle incidents at all severity levels, per million kilometers. The annual vehicle safety target is to maintain Linde’s CVIR at <2.5/million kilometers. In 2020, this target was achieved: Linde’s global CVIR was 1.7 vehicle incidents per million kilometers (2019: 2.17). Linde product drivers and product contract drivers drive approximately a billion kilometers each year, equivalent to 68 times around the circumference of the earth each day, in all the countries, approximately 100, where we do business. Each high- severity vehicle incident is investigated, and the results from the investigation are reviewed by local leadership and Corporate SHEQ, including root cause analysis and corrective actions. In addition, selected high- severity incidents based on results and learnings are reviewed monthly with corporate and regional leadership. Target scope excludes service vehicles. Annually, all high-severity vehicle incidents, which are defined by Linde standards and closely aligned with ICCA guidance, are reviewed. As part of this review, an analysis is conducted to identify improvement opportunity areas in which the learnings and conclusions, as identified from the analysis, are used to improve safety standards and/or establish new initiatives and focus areas. As an example, the learning and conclusions identified from the 2020 analysis resulted in additional 2021 safety initiatives in the areas of addressing driver fatigue and driver distraction in addition to a continued focus in transport contractor management and driver development programs. See GRI 403-2 for more information. • Zero global sales of coating slurries that contain hexavalent chrome [Cr(VI)] by 2029. The scope is Surface Technologies. Four targets were established in relation to eliminating Cr(VI)-containing slurries and replacing coatings with strontium chromate, which is currently used in several SermeTel® and SermaLon® coatings. • By 2019: Offer coatings free of strontium chromate. • By 2021: Offer 100 percent chrome-free slurry product alternatives to the market. • By 2024: No sales of coating slurries that contain Cr(VI) if chrome- free alternatives have been developed and qualified by the original equipment manufacturers (OEMs). • By 2029: No sales of coating slurries that contain Cr(VI). These targets were prompted by the requirements of REACH*, but go beyond REACH in that they apply worldwide and will eliminate toxic substances not just in Europe, as required by REACH, but everywhere. Surface Technologies continues to develop additional Cr(VI)-free alternatives to replace legacy SermeTel systems targeted for elimination in 2029. In addition to the three targets to eliminate Cr(VI)-containing slurries, Surface Technologies has expanded its focus and developed replacement coatings that are free of strontium chromate, a chemical that is currently used in several SermeTel and SermaLon coatings. This target is on track. In 2019, Surface Technologies introduced replacement coatings to major OEMs, and they have been accepted and incorporated into usage, allowing the OEMs to comply with the January 2019 REACH sunset date for strontium chromate. Cr(VI)-free products have been introduced to the market. Upon the adoption of these products by the aerospace, industrial, and oil and gas industries, we have the potential to reduce our usage of Cr(VI)- containing substances of concern by an estimated 8,000–9,000 pounds annually. *REACH (the Registration, Evaluation, and Restriction of Chemicals) is a European Union regulation that aims to improve the protection of human health and the environment through the better and earlier identification of the intrinsic properties of chemical substances. This is done by the four processes of REACH, namely the registration, evaluation, authorisation and restriction of chemicals.\n",

      "24 Linde 2020 Sustainable Development Report Diversity & Inclusion This PF has four targets: one for Diversity & Inclusion (target year 2030), two for Community and one for Global Giving. • Diversity & Inclusion: achieve 30 percent representation of women globally by 2030 The aspirational goal for Linde is to achieve 30 percent female representation at all levels in Linde’s global professional employee population by 2030. In 2020, the overall average percentage of female professionals in the global Linde organization was 27 percent, flat with 2019 but on track to achieve target. The percentage of female executives in the global Linde organization was 17 percent, an increase from 16 percent in 2019. The global organizational goal of 30 percent is intended to apply at all management levels and for all business units and functions. The scope is all Linde employees. Inclusion is a Linde core value. The company embraces diversity and inclusion in order to attract, develop and retain the best talent and build high-performing teams. Linde’s CBI states that employees must not be discriminated against on the basis of their race, color, religion, gender, gender identity, national origin, age, disability, veteran status, pregnancy, sexual orientation or other protected characteristics. Linde’s Board and management have aligned diversity and inclusion with its business strategies and implemented diversity action planning into business process, performance management and executive compensation. See GRI 405-1 for more information. Community Engagement • Complete 550 Projects in Community Engagement Target scope is all reported employee-based Linde community engagement activities. Linde reported 317 projects in 2020. Projects are defined as reported by the project team into a Linde database. Linde measures the impact of projects, where applicable, on the community beneficiaries, employees and the company. Analysis shows positive impacts for all three groups. For example, teams report that in 92 percent of projects, the quality of life of the beneficiaries is positively impacted; in 80 percent of projects, teams reported that their own management effectiveness improved; in 90 percent of projects, teams reported positive employee engagement. Results for baseline year 2018 are as reported for legacy Praxair. The results for 2020 reflect the reality of the pandemic, which reduced direct human engagement. Community engagement projects are directed to address local needs. Projects focus on four themes: Education & Diversity (25 percent); Health & Wellness (21 percent); Community Support (45 percent); and Environment (9 percent). See GRI 413-1 for more information. • Community Relations (U.S.): community impact assessments in engineering project development at all new sites Scope is all new U.S. large capital projects that pass the regular engineering design process and commence construction. This target was launched in 2020 and activity will begin in 2021. The Community Impact Assessment is made by the business and project execution teams during the planning of new and/or significant expansions of Linde sites. It includes a discussion with key stakeholders in the community, which may include representatives from municipalities and community organizations; understanding community needs; and a proposal of potential ways to address these community needs and bring positive impact, especially through social, educational or environmental initiatives. Global Giving • Global Giving: increase environmental/climate-related philanthropic spend by 50 percent Target scope is Global Giving donations from corporate and global businesses. The program contributed $684,000 to environmental- related organizations in 2020, a 23 percent increase from the baseline and on track to achieve target. The objective of this target is to direct additional Global Giving funds towards initiatives that will have a positive impact on the environment/climate change and to support Linde’s new Climate Change targets. Linde has long-standing relationships with global environmental non-profit organizations such as The Nature Conservancy and the Arbor Day Foundation. Our company also supports regionally-based environmental programs in various countries, including Mexico, Canada, South Korea, Brazil and India. See GRI 201-1, 203-1 and 413-1 for more information.

      "25 Linde 2020 Sustainable Development Report Corporate Governance A comprehensive review of Linde’s corporate governance framework is provided on our website at: http://www.linde.com. It is also included in the proxy statement, dated April 29, 2021, for the 2021 Annual General Meeting of Shareholders in the Corporate Governance and Board Matters section. Linde’s Board of Directors consists of 12 Board members, each of whom joined the Board in 2018, when the Praxair-Linde business combination closed. Eleven are independent non-executive directors, including the non-executive Chairman of the Board. Linde’s CEO serves as an executive director. The Board currently has four standing committees: Audit Committee, Compensation Committee, Executive Committee, and Nomination and Governance Committee. Each is comprised of only independent directors, except for the Executive Committee, of which the CEO is a member. The Board maintains oversight of the company's values and strategy. Each year, it conducts a comprehensive long-term strategic review of the company's outlook and business plans and provides advice and counsel to management regarding the company's strategic issues. Linde’s values are considered integral to its long-term sustainable success, and executive compensation rewards performance in financial and strategic non-financial areas. The Board’s role in these areas, as well as in risk management, is described in the company’s annual proxy statement in the Corporate Governance and Board Matters Section, which is available on Linde’s website at: https://investors.linde.com/regulatory-filings. The Board has oversight of key aspects of the corporate governance structure in areas of particular interest to the sustainability community, such as director independence; split roles of Chairman and CEO; appropriate board committees; board effectiveness; shareholder outreach and alignment with long-term shareholder interests; mechanisms to avoid conflicts of interest; board diversity; limits to service; industry experience; and a comprehensive sustainability program. Board members are nominated by the Nomination and Governance Committee for election by the shareholders. Nominees are elected each year at the Annual General Meeting. The Nomination and Governance Committee believes that each director has an established record of accomplishment in areas relevant to our business and objectives, and possesses the characteristics identified in our Corporate Governance Guidelines as essential to a well- functioning and deliberative governing body, including integrity, independence and commitment. Each Board member has executive management and director oversight experience in most, if not all, areas that the Board considers critical to the conduct of the company’s business, including public policies as they affect global industrial corporations, compliance, corporate governance, productivity management, safety management and sustainable development. Governance of Non-Financial Matters Linde has established five core values: safety, inclusion, accountability, integrity and community. These are the basis of what the company stands for and how it behaves. A code of ethics has been adopted that provides clear instructions on expected behavior and for reporting concerns about potential non-conformance. This code has been approved by the Linde Board of Directors and is named the “Code of Business Integrity (CBI).” This document is made widely available to employees and third parties and is posted on the company’s website. Governance of Linde's CBI is described in the Performance section as it relates to an SD 2028 target. It is the view of Linde’s Board that non-financial issues are a component of the company's values, culture and performance expectations, and are a basis on which employees drive financial results. The Board has confirmed the importance of setting non- financial objectives as part of variable compensation to reinforce leadership’s focus on maintaining a culture that supports both short- and long-term sustainable results. It has established non-financial goals with respect to elements such as safety, environmental responsibility, global compliance, productivity and talent management. These measures are described in Linde’s April 2020 proxy statement. Annual payout of executive variable compensation depends on performance in several strategic non- financial areas, including best-in-class performance in safety, environmental responsibility, global compliance, productivity and talent management. Linde’s Board monitors the implementation of its CBI, which includes commitments to adhere to high standards for diversity and inclusion; safety; health; care for the environment and quality; human rights; corporate citizenship; and the prevention of bribery and corruption. The Audit Committee oversees the company's compliance with legal and regulatory requirements. The Compensation Committee oversees diversity and inclusion policies, objectives and programs to achieve those objectives. The Nomination and Governance Committee periodically reviews the company’s guidelines and policies governing its response to important broad public policy issues in the areas of corporate social responsibility and corporate citizenship. Alignment with Compensation When setting annual performance-based variable compensation targets and goals, the Linde Board Compensation Committee determined that selected key strategic and non-financial factors will be considered in determining potential variable compensation awards, and to recognize that these factors are also critical to measuring our businesses’ health and the potential for future success. The strategic and non-financial factors are weighed at 25 percent of the total payout. For 2020, management presented the degree of achievement in meeting each goal, and for each element, provided its view of the relative degree of importance to Linde’s long-term success. Based on the results, the Compensation Committee determined that the company’s performance with respect to the strategic and non-financial goals was favorable and set the Corporate strategic and non-financial payout factor at 160 percent of target variable compensation (relative to a 200 percent maximum). The table below illustrates the basis for which non-financial awards was determined. Governance 102-18\n",

      "27 Linde 2020 Sustainable Development Report Sustainable Development Governance 102-19, 102-20 Sustainable development is overseen by the Board and executive leadership and integrated throughout the company. Linde’s Board of Directors: In 2020, the full Board requested several presentations on issues directly related to sustainable development. Presentations were made on sustainability and climate change, on Linde’s Technology and Decarbonization strategy and, on Linde’s Climate Change targets. In addition, the Board reviews safety matters at each meeting. A compliance presentation is made annually by the Chief Compliance Officer. A presentation is made annually by the Chief Human Resources (HR) Officer on Linde’s program in Diversity and Inclusion. The Management Committee is the highest executive leadership team. It has responsibility for economic, environmental and social topics, and it oversees and approves of sustainable development strategies and programs. In 2020, they received presentations on all the issues that went to the Board. The EVP and Chief Operating Officer (COO) is a member of the executive leadership team and reports directly to the CEO. He is responsible for the regional operating segments of the Americas, APAC, and EMEA, as well as Linde Engineering, Lincare and Global Functions of Safety, Health, Environment and Quality (SHEQ), Applications Technology, Clean Energy, Sustainability and Digitalization. Linde’s EVP, Clean Energy is the executive officer responsible for sustainability. He is a member of the executive leadership team and reports to the COO. In addition to oversight of sustainable development, he is responsible for digitilization, technology and leading hydrogen strategy and partnerships, including green hydrogen and clean fuels programs. Specifically, in relation to sustainability and climate change, the EVP, Clean Energy is the highest management level responsible for coordinating the SD 2028 targets, including Linde’s climate change targets. The EVP, Clean Energy is responsible for aligning various functions of the organization and the businesses around sustainability goals: development of targets (by sustainability), standardizing methodologies (various global functions such as SHEQ and R&D, as well as HR and Legal), and reporting performance against many of the targets (for example, COE for environmental performance, SHEQ for safety performance, Strategy and Capex for investments in decarbonization, and R&D for innovation and growth related to decarbonization). In 2020, Linde formed the Linde Clean Hydrogen team to serve as a focal point for green hydrogen and clean fuels. Vice President, Sustainability reports to the EVP, Clean Energy and is the highest-ranking functional leader of sustainability. She is the Chair of the Corporate SD Council and coordinates performance and action planning to define and achieve the SD 2028 targets and action plans. She is also responsible for coordinating consultations with internal and external stakeholders relating to Environmental and Social Governance (ESG) issues (see the Engaging Stakeholders section) and staying current with emerging issues. She also leads global internal and external engagement on sustainable development issues and ensures the fair, reasonable treatment of all perspectives. The Corporate Sustainable Development Council (SD Council) is the corporate committee responsible for the proposal and execution of Linde’s sustainable development strategy, targets and programs. It consists of the heads of functions that support the implementation of Linde’s SD strategy and targets, and the designated heads of Operating Segments, Engineering, and global businesses who lead SD implementation in their areas. The SD Council is the institutional link between the Management Committee and the Board on Linde’s sustainable development. Business SD Councils are established in each Linde Operating Segment and global business. They are comprised of functional leads and coordinated by a business-level Sustainable Development leader, supported by an SD Coordinator, both appointed by that business' president. Business Councils meet quarterly. They lead business- and functional-level internal and external engagement on sustainable development and coordinate the implementation of local sustainable development action plans and Linde’s Sustainable Development Management System (SDMS). Business SD Coordinators participate in a monthly global meeting coordinated by the office of Sustainable Development. They share sustainable development best practices and challenges between corporate groups and the businesses. Linde’s 10-year SD (SD 2028) targets were set in 2019 and are baselined in 2018 to reflect the starting year of the combined company. They were developed at the request of Linde’s Board and Management Committee, who approved them in early 2020. These are managed targets; the businesses are accountable for achieving them. Reporting on specific targets is consolidated and coordinated by one or more corporate functional vice presidents and is reviewed internally (in most cases, monthly). Linde’s energy and climate change targets are reported each month from the businesses and reviewed at a monthly global meeting of the COE, led by its vice president. The meeting tracks trends against targets and seeks opportunities to replicate best practices. This monthly report is then provided to the Finance office, the CFO and the Management Committee. Other operational targets for water, sustainable productivity, zero waste and community engagement also report monthly into the COE meeting. Zero Waste, Community Engagement and Workforce Development programs are led by the Sustainable Development function. Community engagement encourages business programs that engage employees in volunteerism in their communities. “Community” is a core company value; community engagement is considered a leadership activity. Linde sites maintain a strong Community Engagement program. Workforce Development programs have been designed and launched with community partners in a range of areas from welding to additive manufacturing to heavy-duty truck driving.\n",
      "28 Linde 2020 Sustainable Development Report Risk Management Linde’s risk management process includes risk reviews by management as well as annual review by the Board. In its Annual Report (10k), Linde lists risk factors that management assesses may significantly impact the company. Several risk factors have been identified. Risks include short-term, long-term and emerging risks. Examples of emerging, long-term risks include: Catastrophic Events or Natural Disasters Increasing Significance According to TCFD, natural disasters are increasingly common due to the rise in Earth’s temperature. TCFD notes impacts to ecosystems, human health and businesses; see https://www.fsb-tcfd.org/about/. Potential Impact on Linde The potential impact of this risk is both short- and long-term. Linde’s most recent risk assessment notes that such events could disrupt or delay Linde’s ability to produce and distribute its products to customers and could potentially expose Linde to third-party liability claims. In addition, such events could impact Linde’s customers and suppliers resulting in temporary or long- term outages and/or the limitation of supply of energy and other raw materials used in normal business operations. Steps Undertaken Linde evaluates the direct and indirect business risks, consults with vendors, insurance providers and industry experts, makes investments in suitably resilient design and technology, and conducts regular reviews of the business risks with management. See Linde’s 2020 Annual Report (10k), page 9, and Linde’s 2021 CDP Climate Change Response. IT System Failures and Network Disruptions Increasing Significance According to the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), there is increased risk for “wide-scale or high- consequence events.” The agency notes that critical infrastructure is increasingly subject to sophisticated cyber intrusions that pose new risks; see https://www.cisa.gov/cybersecurity. Potential Impact on Linde Linde’s most recent risk assessment notes that the company relies on information technology systems and networks, and stores and processes sensitive business and proprietary information in these systems and networks. Operational failures and breaches of security from increasingly sophisticated cyberthreats could lead to the loss or disclosure of confidential information, result in business interruption or malfunction or regulatory actions and have a material adverse impact on the company’s operations, reputation and financial results. Steps Undertaken Linde has taken steps to address these risks and concerns by implementing advanced security technologies, internal controls, network and data center resiliency and recovery process.

Linde’s annual Sustainable Development Report (this report) provides additional quantitative and qualitative non-financial information the company believes to be relevant to stakeholders and key to driving long-term sustainable results and disclosures based on the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Sustainability Reporting Standards. In the sustainability reporting ecosystem, the GRI Sustainability Reporting Standards is one of several key frameworks and standards for voluntary disclosure. It is designed to provide sustainability information of relevance to a broad range of stakeholders, such as employees and potential employees, communities, customers, suppliers, regulators and the general public. Linde is also aligned with other reporting frameworks; see the \"Reporting Frameworks Applied\" section. This report scope is for the full Linde plc organization and for the calendar year 2020. Information is provided from entities where Linde is the majority shareholder (more than 50 percent) and certain joint ventures (JVs). It excludes data from entities where Linde has a minority interest. Principles for Defining Report Content and Quality Consistent with the GRI Standards and to define the content and the quality of data and narrative in this report, the company followed the principles of being context-driven, inclusive, material, responsive and complete, and had data externally assured in Priority Factor (PF) areas. Data Consolidation and Reporting Various databases are managed across Linde to aggregate data. Data is collected from the businesses and other corporate functions, including Safety, Health, Environment & Quality (SHEQ), Human Resources (HR), Finance, Operations, Center of Excellence (COE) (which includes Procurement and Productivity), R&D, Sales, Sustainable Development and the Global Giving Program. Consolidated information is housed in various corporate databases. Linde uses a licensed global sustainability reporting software program to integrate data reporting for sustainable development. Performance data is reported against the Linde Sustainable Development 2028 (SD 2028) targets to a management team. See 103-1, 103-2 and 103-2 for management discussion and analysis (MD&A) for economic, environmental and social topics. Reporting Frameworks Applied This report drew on these voluntary reporting frameworks: GRI Sustainability Reporting Standards (GRI SRSs). This report has been prepared in Accordance with the GRI Standards: Core option. For the GRI Content Index Service, GRI Services reviewed that the GRI Content Index is clearly presented and the references for all disclosures included align with the appropriate sections in the body of the report. See the Content Index at the end of this report. Those standards that are considered material are marked within this Annex by the following symbol: 1. The Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) framework was used to ensure that disclosures about climate change are linked to information about financial performance in mainstream financial reports. See Linde TCFD Index at: https://www.linde.com/about- linde/sustainable-development/reporting-center. 2. The International Integrated Reporting Framework provides a framework for investors and other stakeholders to gain greater insight into the medium- and long-term sustainability of a company. It proposes that a company should report how it manages all its six capital flows: financial capital as well as human, intellectual, manufactured, natural and social and relationship (sometimes referred to collectively as \"social capital\"), and the connectivity between them. 3. Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) Standard for the Chemicals Sector (Version 2018-10). This provides sector standards and KPIs that are considered materially relevant to ESG investors.

      "38 Linde 2020 Sustainable Development Report 102-48 Restatements of information • Linde updated its methodology for calculating steam consumption. Instead of an equivalent amount of electricity used, the thermal balance is now calculated, which accounts for efficiency losses during the generation of electricity from steam. This results in more accurate calculations and led to an increase in steam consumed as well as a corresponding increase in calculated Scope 2 emissions. Scope 3 emissions in the fuel- and energy- related emissions category also increased accordingly, as did Scope 3 emissions in the investments category. The new methodology has been applied from 2018 onwards; 2018 and 2019 values have been restated for steam consumption, total non-renewable energy consumption, total energy consumption, Scope 2 emissions, Scope 3 fuel and energy-related emissions, Scope 3 investments and, total GHG and GHG intensity. • Linde is restating water withdrawal, discharge and consumption to align with GRI’s updated Standard 303: Water and Effluents 2018. Linde transitioned to the 2018 version of the 303 Standard in 2020 and updated its fresh and non-fresh water classifications accordingly. This led to a decrease in fresh water withdrawn from municipal utilities and an increase in industrial/recycled (non-fresh) water withdrawn. Discharge and consumption figures were also adjusted accordingly. The revised reclassifications have been applied from 2018 onwards. • Linde is restating NOx emissions for 2018 and 2019 due to updating the emission factor for diesel, which caused NOx emissions to increase. The updated emission factor has been applied from 2018 onwards. • Linde is restating 2019 COD due to the updated reporting from one site. 102-49 Changes in reporting See 102-48 for restatements Reporting Pro Forma 2018 and Reporting of Numbers for Linde’s SD 2028 Targets Data is reported consistent with Linde’s 2019 Sustainable Development Report and utilizes pro forma information. “Pro forma” definition: Pro forma means a calculated number or result that is not related to the official financial boundaries, reporting scope or period. A pro forma number serves as an indicator of what the result of the new merged company would theoretically look like if the new company had reported for the complete year and applied new company reporting boundaries and methodologies. As an example, financial reporting for 2018 was based on a full year of Linde Inc. (formerly named Praxair, Inc.) results plus two months of Linde GmbH (previously Linde AG), as the merger legally took place at the end of October 2018. The 2018 pro forma result, in contrast, reflects the complete 2018 calendar year. Please see Linde’s 2019 Sustainable Development Report for more information on the use of pro forma information for 2018 and baselines.\n",

The Code is posted on the company website and is communicated to employees. It provides clear instructions on expected behavior to conform with the Code and for reporting of concerns about potential non- conformance. Employees also receive training and certification to the Code. Subcontractors and other stakeholders are expected to follow this standard. The Board Audit Committee is responsible to review the processes and results for certification of employees’ understanding of, and compliance with, the company’s Business Integrity and Ethics Policy. Linde has appointed a CCO within the department of Global Legal and Compliance, who reports to the General Counsel, who reports to the CEO. Compliance with policies prohibiting corruption or anti-competitive behavior, the maintenance of Linde's reputation for strong ethics and integrity, and the protection of human rights are managed under the CCO. The Board’s Audit Committee reviews the company’s key compliance risks and compliance program, including that program’s design, implementation and effectiveness, with the CCO and the General Counsel. Linde follows the law and is governed by all local laws wherever it is located. In the event of a conflict between local law and the CBI or company policy, Linde will follow the stricter standard within the framework of the applicable laws. The issues of information and cybersecurity fall under the remit of the Board Audit Committee. In addition, the full Board reviews cybersecurity as part of its regular risk reviews. Linde has appointed a Global Chief Information Officer (CIO) reporting to the chief financial officer (CFO). The CIO is the senior functional head of information and cybersecurity. A Chief Cybersecurity Officer reports to the CIO. Linde's executive annual variable compensation is impacted by performance in non-financial areas considered to be Strategic Business Objectives. These include achieving best-in-class performance in several areas, including global compliance.

By revenue, 87 percent of Linde’s worldwide gases production and engineering sites are externally certified to RCMS, ISO 14001 or an equivalent national standard. Internal SHEQ Assessment Program All Linde sites, and other sites where Linde is a majority shareholder, are evaluated for safety, environment and quality (the latter for compliance with local medical regulations, where applicable). Quarterly assessment reports are provided to senior management. The full Board is committed to review safety and environmental risks at each board meeting. Regular assessments are a requirement of Linde's SHEQ standards and help ensure consistently high standards in all areas of safety, environmental protection, security and compliance. Linde's internal SHEQ assessment program includes type \"A\" and \"B\" assessments and facility self-assessments. Type A assessments are led by Global SHEQ staff or their designated agent. Type B assessments are led by a member of one of the global business units. Both type A and B assessments are independent of the facility being audited, and the number of these assessments is tracked by Global SHEQ. Facility self-assessments are also conducted by local or regional personnel to help facilities self-identify areas in need of improvement and are not tracked outside of the local operating unit. In 2020, Linde conducted 26 \"A\" assessment audits, all at Linde sites, and 250 internal \"B\" assessment audits as per business safety plans. See GEN (2). Fewer assessments were conducted in 2020 due to travel and other restrictions associated with the COVID-19 pandemic.

Organizational Responsibility, Accountability and Incentives Linde’s strong worldwide social policies and procedures include issues such as compliance and integrity, human resources, diversity and inclusion, safety, community engagement and Global Giving. These are managed as part of daily operations. In many cases, suppliers are expected to adhere to equivalent standards. Linde's CEO and the Board of Directors are accountable for social issues impacting the company. Linde’s full Board of Directors has responsibility for reviewing safety and environmental risk at each Board meeting. The Compensation Committee assists the Board in its oversight of Linde’s compensation and incentive policies and programs, and management development and succession, particularly in regard to reviewing executive compensation for Linde’s executive officers. The Committee also periodically reviews the company’s diversity policies and objectives, and the programs to achieve those objectives. Charitable contributions are mainly made through the Global Giving Program. Employee community engagement in all businesses and functions is promoted from the Sustainable Development department. Responsibility for performance lies with the businesses. Several executives are responsible for social issues: • The CHRO is responsible for talent sourcing, management and retention, and diversity and inclusion. He reports to the CEO. The global leader of Diversity and Inclusion is the senior functional lead in this area and reports to the CHRO. • The General Counsel is responsible for ethics and integrity and compliance and reports to the CEO. The CCO is the senior functional lead in this area. He reports to the General Counsel. • The COO is responsible for SHEQ and reports to the CEO. The vice president of SHEQ is the senior functional lead in this area. • The COO is responsible for sustainable development. The EVP, Clean Energy, reports to the COO and oversees sustainable development. The VP, Sustainability is the senior functional lead in this area. • Procurement leadership exists within each business segment and region, and the vice presidents serve as the senior functional leads in this area. Together with the CCO, they coordinate activity to ensure adherence to Linde’s supplier sustainability and human rights commitments, among others. Safety, inclusion and community are Linde values, and, therefore, are non-negotiable. Linde's executive annual variable compensation is impacted by performance in non-financial areas considered to be Strategic Business Objectives. These include achieving best-in-class performance in several areas, including safety and talent management. Policies, Commitments, Goals and Targets Corporate policies are posted on the company website at www.linde.com. Linde's CBI, corporate HSE Policy, Human Rights Policy, Global Diversity & Inclusion Guidelines, Supplier Code of Conduct and other corporate and country-level policies make clear the company's commitment to and management processes for addressing relevant areas of potential human rights concern. These include: • Safety and health protection; a safe work environment • The prevention of discrimination and harassment of employees • Equal opportunity and equal treatment • Merit-based decisions on recruitment, hiring, promotion and compensation • Compliance with regulations, including on working hours • The right to privacy • Freedom of association and freedom of peaceful assembly, including freedom to choose whether to engage in collective bargaining and employees' participation in works agreements in various countries Specifically, the Linde CBI makes clear Linde's commitment to human rights. Linde recognizes every person's innate humanity and treats everyone with dignity and respect. In supporting the protection and promotion of human rights worldwide, Linde abides by the principles of the International Bill of Human Rights enacted by the United Nations, and does not condone or engage in discrimination; harassment; violations of privacy, slavery or servitude; restrictions on free assembly; or unfair employment practices. Linde commits to adhering to these human rights principles and expects similar standards to be observed by all with whom it conducts business. As described in Sustainable Development Targets 2028 (102-47) on page 10, Linde’s social PFs and related SD 2028 targets include Environment, Safety & Health; and People Development & Communities, and they have related KPIs and SD 2028\n",

A full description of Linde's financial results is provided in the Annual Report (10K). See also EC (1) for earnings per share (EPS) performance. Tax Strategy Linde is a leading industrial gases and engineering company with more than 74,000 employees globally, serving customers in approximately 100 countries worldwide. Linde delivers innovative and sustainable solutions to customers and creates long-term value for all stakeholders. The company is making our world more productive by providing products, technologies and services that help customers improve their economic and environmental performance in a connected world. The nature of Linde’s industrial gases business is substantially local. As a result, Linde generates income and pays taxes in jurisdictions in which it has business operations. In case of cross-border transactions, the respective Linde parties endeavor to comply with the applicable transfer price regimes, including transfer price determination rules. Linde’s business, in particular in the industrial gases segment, is capital-intensive. Linde believes that capital investment provides the basis for economic growth; hence the company supports tax policies that promote capital investment. Linde is committed to developing new technologies that help its customers increase productivity and achieve environmental benefits in a wide range of industries. Linde also supports tax policies that incent innovation and protect the value of intellectual property. Linde’s intellectual property assets are primarily developed and maintained in the United States and Germany, both geographies that are not typically regarded as low-tax countries. Transfer of these assets to low-tax jurisdictions is not part of Linde’s tax planning. Linde, as a multinational company, supports the continued expansion of a network of bilateral income tax treaties to reduce barriers to cross-border investment and eliminate double taxation. For all of these reasons, Linde advocates for tax policies that drive economic growth, particularly in areas of increased engineering efficiency and enhanced local production and development. Linde has adopted a CBI and One Linde Philosophy. It explains Linde’s corporate vision, mission and values —safety, integrity, accountability, inclusion and community. The principles in the CBI set out Linde’s commitment to integrity, to its employees, to the company, to its customers and partners and to its communities. The CBI provides guidance and insight to navigate compliance and ethical questions and to promote an overall culture of compliance. One key guiding principle is full compliance with applicable laws and regulations. In line with its CBI, Linde manages its tax affairs in a responsible and transparent manner and in compliance with applicable tax legislation. Linde maintains processes and controls designed to minimize the risk of errors that could impact the amount of tax that it pays. These processes and controls are regularly monitored, reviewed and tested, and underpin the preparation and submission of its tax returns. Linde has a responsibility to its shareholders to maximize returns and structure its affairs in an efficient manner, including taxes. Linde’s effective tax rate and tax exposures are reviewed annually with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. Linde discloses its effective tax rate publicly, together with the associated risks for the company’s future tax rate and exposures, in the company’s annual 10-K filing on its website at: https://investors.linde.com/-/media/linde/investors/documents/full-year-financial-reports/2020-linde-annual-report-to-shareholders.pdf?la=en Charitable Spend Linde Global Giving Program spend: $9.4 million.

      "48 Linde 2020 Sustainable Development Report 201-1 In 2020, the Linde Global Giving Program donated approximately 10 percent of Global Giving funds toward efforts to increase diversity and inclusion. About forty percent of the funding was directed to education and approximately 6 percent was directed to the environment. Each of these three areas directly complements the company's strategic focus for philanthropy. The balance provided impact in communities through targeted community support, healthcare support and other areas; support for disaster relief in 2020 represented about 16 percent of charitable giving. Linde also reports the breakdown of Global Giving support by purpose and by region. See also 413-1 for information on community engagement.

Further detail is provided in Note 16, pages 83 and following, in Linde’s 10-K filing. Dependent upon the business and date of hire, employees may participate in legacy Praxair or Linde GmbH (previously Linde AG) programs, which may include defined benefits and contributions. Retirement coverage for employees of the company’s international subsidiaries is provided by those companies through separate plans that are typical for the country of employment. 201-4 Financial assistance received from government The government is not present in Linde’s shareholding structure. Linde periodically receives grants from government entities (e.g., the Department of Energy in the U.S., Department of Research and Education BMBF/ Department of Economy BMWI in Germany) to sponsor innovation. Linde also periodically receives local, state, country or regional economic development incentives related to capital investments. 202-1 Ratios of standard entry-level wage by gender compared to local minimum wage at significant locations of operation One hundred percent of employees in all business units earn at least the local minimum wage. Linde's CBI reinforces its commitment to \"provide equal employment opportunity, and we recruit, hire, promote and compensate people based solely on merit and ability.\" This is reinforced by Linde's Diversity & Inclusion Guidelines, provided on the website at: https://www.linde.com/-/media/linde/merger/documents/diversity-and- inclusion/linde_global_di_policy.pdf?la=en. See also Linde’s Human Rights Policy: https://www.linde.com/sustainable-development/policies-and- position-statements/human-rights-policy. Linde’s compensation policy assigns jobs into pay levels based on job descriptions so that people performing the same type of job functions are in the same pay range, regardless of age, gender or race. To help ensure that its compensation policy is being appropriately administered, the company conducts annual pay equity analyses in the United States and in other countries where required by law. Specific salary information is confidential.\n",
      "50 Linde 2020 Sustainable Development Report 202-2 Proportion of senior management hired from the local community at significant locations of operation Linde's business model is locally focused: Consistent with its growth goals and goals to grow innovation capacity in emerging economies, Linde has a commitment to source and develop local talent. Many country or regional business leaders are local or regional nationals. In hiring and promotion, the company practices the consideration of local leadership who understands the culture and business practices of the area. This provides ideal role models for the local workforce and offers a more cost-effective option than moving leaders from another country. The following activities help ensure that local talent receives leadership opportunities: 1. Increase local recruiting efforts. 2. Train and develop current workforce for advancement. 3. Offer opportunities for language learning to promote the ability to operate effectively in a multi-national environment. 4. Create opportunities for high-potential local nationals to have special assignments outside their home countries. 5. Collaborate with educational programs to develop the local workforce. See 405-1. 203-1 Development and impact of infrastructure investments and services supported A significant portion of the company's applications support the development of social and economic infrastructures. Linde gases help to enable safe drinking water for more than 200 million people each day. Industrial and specialty gases enable cleaner and more efficient economic growth in industries from cement to steel. Linde applications are also integral to the development of future energy infrastructures (e.g., applications for renewable energy and second-generation biofuels). The company is committed to improving the quality of life in the communities it serves. Through financial contributions and the volunteer efforts of employees, Linde supports programs that address diversity, education, the environment and community resilience — all important aspects of community sustainability. In 2020, the company’s Global Giving Program contributed $9.4 million to a range of programs and charitable organizations around the world. See 201-1 for information on how the Global Giving contribution was distributed by focus area and by business region. Employee and facility/business contributions from community engagement projects were estimated at more than $800,000, and the dollar value of employee and facility in-kind contributions, such as food, clothing and supplies, was estimated at more than $500,000. Global Giving also tracked more than $500,000 in in-kind contributions of Linde products such as gases. The total Linde contribution, including in-kind contributions, but not volunteer time, is estimated at approximately $11 million. The estimated value of volunteer time is nearly $500,000. 203-2 Significant indirect economic impacts Linde's business helps countries modernize with technologies that enable environmentally responsible economic growth. Linde provides careers and benefits to nearly 75,000 employees, many of whom are hired locally, and to thousands of retirees. Indirect benefits accrue to Linde’s vendors (also, often, contracted locally), as well as customers, shareholders and communities in which the company operates. For descriptions of how Linde's business model enables indirect economic, social and environmental benefits, see pages 8 and 9. The company hires local talent: • Most emerging economy business leaders are host country or regional nationals. • It sources local contractors. Substantially all contract drivers, and most contract construction workers, are sourced locally. • It helps build capacity in local communities. Linde employee volunteers provided a range of benefits to approximately 350,000 people, mostly in communities local to Linde sites. All Linde community engagement projects are encouraged to help meet specific needs identified by community leaders, but there is no science to measure the impact of community outreach. Linde uses a methodology developed by the London Benchmarking Group (LBG)\n",
      "Linde 2020 Sustainable Development Report 51 203-2 to evaluate the indirect economic, environmental and social impacts of its community engagement activity for the company, its employees and beneficiaries (see 413-1 and 413-2). In 2020, for 92 percent of projects, volunteers reported that community engagement had a direct positive impact on recipients' quality of life. In approximately 59 percent of projects, volunteers reported that community engagement provided the beneficiaries with value that could lead to economic benefits, such as job skills or opportunities for personal growth. Community engagement is a component of Linde's SD 2028 goals, with the target to deliver 550 projects per year in communities by 2028 through Linde community engagement initiatives. In 2020, Linde employees delivered more than 300 such projects, as substantial portion of the 2020 goal, prioritizing support for the pandemic, remote education opportunities and virtual engagement. Many of the projects directed towards education support Linde's contribution to SDG Target 8 to achieve full and productive employment and decent work for all women and men. The significance of Linde's economic and governance PFs and targets in the context of external benchmarks and stakeholder priorities is explained in the introduction to Sustainable Development Targets, page 11. 204-1 Proportion of spending on local suppliers Note: This section responds to 204-1 and also responds to 102-9. Policy Linde’s Supplier Code of Conduct (Supplier Code) is made available on its website at: https://www.linde.com/about-linde/global-procurement. Suppliers, contractors and third parties play a critical role in Linde’s ability to operate and provide products and services to its customers. Suppliers' actions and practices also reflect on Linde. Therefore, the company chooses suppliers carefully based on merit and a due diligence process. Linde expects suppliers to comply with legal requirements and to act in a manner that is consistent with Linde’s values and the principles outlined in its Supplier Code and CBI. The Supplier Code defines Linde’s minimum requirements for its suppliers concerning their responsibilities towards Linde and its stakeholders, societies and the environment. As part of the standard documentation for all new and renewing contracts, suppliers must confirm conformance with the Supplier Code and with Linde’s CBI or equivalent policies of their own. Specific expectations are laid out for Integrity and Legal Compliance; Human Rights and Labor Standards; Health, Safety and Environment; Accuracy of Books and Records; Intellectual Property; and Supply Chain. A grievance mechanism is provided. Local Sourcing Linde works with suppliers in many countries in which it does business — nearly 100 countries. Linde has a corporate value of community. This reflects the nature of Linde's industrial gas products: it is generally uneconomical to transport them distances greater than a few hundred miles from the production facility. As a result, the company invests in building local facilities and hires locally for management, employees and contractors. The most significant sets of suppliers from the point of view of local sourcing are facility construction contractors and contract drivers. Installation of new equipment, as well as ongoing maintenance, is largely performed by local suppliers. Linde uses locally-sourced contract drivers in most of its Asia Pacific countries; in EMEA (except for Germany and the UK); in South America; and in parts of Central America. 102-9 The company invests in supplier capacity-building to raise performance standards and share benefits at the same time. The company also values opportunities to engage suppliers and team members to better understand product offerings and applications. Past examples of supplier collaboration include the Supplier Innovation Fair at the Linde Technology Center, where suppliers discussed technology topics with Linde team members. Currently, Group Procurement Fleet Management is working with suppliers in some localities on initiatives for vehicles with lower fossil fuel consumption, as part of overall efforts to lower CO2 emissions. Promoting Supplier Diversity Providing innovative and valuable solutions for customers around the globe requires diverse talents, perspectives and experiences. As part of this, Linde supports programs that assist it in fostering relationships with a variety of qualified, diverse businesses for its supply chain around the globe.\n",
      "52 Linde 2020 Sustainable Development Report 204-1, 102-9 Linde's Supplier Diversity Program in the U.S. encourages and supports the use of a variety of qualified distinct business enterprises. It seeks to provide maximum practical opportunities for diverse businesses to participate in the supply of goods and/or services that support the company's business model. In South Africa, Afrox participates in the Broad Based Black Economic Empowerment program and successfully received the verification certificate for seven consecutive years. The company achieved a Level 1, the highest ranking, in 2020. The program has championed companies classified as small and diverse businesses for nearly two decades. The vice president and controller serves as the small business liaison officer and oversees the Small Business Subcontracting Program. On an annual basis, in collaboration with management and support staff from the company’s Procurement team, a detailed small business subcontracting plan is established with practical goals that the company strives to achieve with small businesses in procuring designated commodities. In 2020, the company spent a total of $448 million with small and diverse business enterprises. Approximately $340 million was procured from U.S. small businesses, representing products and services that covered approximately 447 different commodity codes. Some companies that identified as small also identified as a veteran-owned or service-disabled-veteran- owned businesses, corresponding to nearly one-tenth of total small business spend, or $31 million. Approximately $26 million was spent with women- owned businesses, and $30 million with minority-owned businesses, including businesses identifying as ethnic minorities or non-ethnic minorities, such as LGBT or persons with disabilities. The company's U.S. Procurement team has collaborated with its global affiliates to understand the supplier diversity landscape and opportunities in each country in which it operates. By leveraging the knowledge and skills of the company's diverse employee population and continuing to provide cultural awareness training around the world, the company strives to achieve an organically inclusive environment where diversity is known as a valuable asset and competitive advantage in its supply chain. Globally, the company continues to identify and enhance supplier diversity initiatives in areas with emerging programs and/or the potential to develop them. In 2020, the company renewed its membership with the Regional Councils of Minority Supplier Development Council (MSDC), Women's Business Enterprise National Council (WBENC), National Gay and Lesbian Chamber of Commerce, NY Chapter (NGLCC-NY) and National Gay and Lesbian Chamber of Commerce (NGLCC). Throughout 2019, the company continued to promote its pre-qualification program for potential suppliers by collecting advanced information on diverse businesses seeking sales opportunities, including, but not limited to, service geography, description of business capabilities and acquired certifications. Coupled with the company's existing business matchmaker program, the advanced business information has continued to provide opportunities for the company's procurement team and operations personnel to more efficiently identify experienced candidates for requests for proposals, leading to a higher percentage of diverse suppliers offering proposals and ultimately being awarded contracts. Outreach and capacity-building with the company's prime supplier population allowed for the sharing of best practices in supplier diversity and yielded a commitment to enhance or establish mutually beneficial diversity metrics from suppliers with whom the company spends $1 million or more with annually. In 2020, the company continued its Tier 2 diverse spend reporting program with U.S. prime suppliers, demonstrating the company's long-term commitment of sustaining diversity and inclusion in its supply chain. The program's goal is to develop diverse suppliers, beyond the company's direct supplier relationships, by providing additional economic growth opportunities. In its fourth year, the program identified $14 million in combined direct and indirect diverse spend. Sixteen prime suppliers from various industry sectors, including telecom, logistics, healthcare and MRO, participated in the program. Capturing this information has allowed the team to advance its supplier diversity program for validating and tracking the company’s spend with diverse businesses and has helped to identify collaboration opportunities for 2021 with companies that have established supplier diversity programs. Investing in Supplier Relationships: A Win-Win-Win Linde works hard to deepen relationships with suppliers and contractors while ensuring that they meet its standards and business values. This brings multiple benefits to the company and to the communities near to its operations. Linde puts a high priority on evaluating risks associated with its supply chain and collaborates with suppliers and other stakeholders where its involvement can make the most impact. On a regular basis, Linde works with its carriers on safety training, initiatives and sharing best practices to continuously improve upon operational efficiency, reduce environmental hazards and promote security and human rights. For example, Procurement is championing a circular economy initiative, engaging with suppliers and academia on benefits of circular supply chains and life cycle analyses. Such engagements can unearth win-win approaches to reduce resources and provide social and environmental benefits throughout the supply chain. Safety Training Worldwide contractor safety training: One-hundred percent of contract drivers, and most contract construction workers, are hired from local firms. In addition to the jobs provided to locally based construction workers and drivers, in 2020, Linde invested more than 1.6 million hours in safety training to\n",
      "Linde 2020 Sustainable Development Report 53 204-1, 102-9 contractors in several categories. This included training for more than 33,000 contractors. Contractor training averaged 49 hours a year, more than a work week. If each contractor hour costs Linde $20, this investment can be estimated at more than $32 million. In all cases, this training is directed towards achieving safer construction of Linde facilities and safer, more secure and more fuel-efficient transportation of Linde products. Linde’s world-class results for contractor and driver safety are a measurable consequence of this investment. See 403-2. In addition, the safety and other professional driver training results in a transfer of professional skills that increases the employability of the recipient For information on supplier and contractor training, see 414-2. 205-1 Operations assessed for risks related to corruption Linde administers an annual risk assessment that is circulated to all business managers globally and functional leaders and covers 100 percent of all business units. Potential risks related to corruption are an explicit focus. A Compliance Review Board (CRB) performs quarterly regulatory risk assessments. Dedicated Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) and anti-bribery audits are also conducted. In the last 10 years, 37 audits have been conducted, an average of four audits per year. Linde operates in certain jurisdictions identified as high risk based on the Corruption Perception Index from Transparency International. The company has not identified significant risks other than regular risks that are dealt with through training and certifications of employees. 205-2 Communication and training on anti-corruption policies and procedures In 2020, Linde’s Board of Directors received training on the CBI, which includes anti-corruption policies and procedures. The company also trains all its salaried employees globally on anti-corruption. The company has an established process to conduct thorough due diligence prior to contracting and sends training to 100 percent of all third parties and agents who interact with the government on the company’s behalf. Linde’s CBI applies to the company's directors and employees, including its CEO, CFO and controller. This CBI, which includes elements of compliance with laws, business integrity and ethics, has been approved by the Linde Board of Directors. To assist employees and directors in complying with this code of ethics, management periodically develops specific standards implementing certain provisions of the code. Linde's CBI is posted on Linde's website. One-hundred percent of salaried Linde management and employees, and some non-exempt employees, are required to annually certify that they have read and understand the company’s CBI, which includes a rigorous outline of the FCPA and anti-bribery laws. This is an online training and survey. Training to targeted populations was conducted in 2020; the company achieved 100 percent compliance with this requirement. 205-3 Confirmed incidents of corruption and actions taken Linde takes its commitment to integrity very seriously. Non-compliance with the CBI, depending on the circumstances, can result in serious disciplinary action up to and including termination of employment. Employees are actively encouraged to report suspected complaints and concerns, and are expected to report violations through a number of channels, including the Integrity Hotline. Reports through the Integrity Hotline may be made anonymously. It is a violation of company policy for any person to retaliate against any individual who has reported any matter in good faith. Table SOC (12) provides the aggregate number of hotline reports and a summary of the types of reports received; see 406-1. All hotline reports are promptly handled, and identified issues are addressed. Further details are not provided in Linde's public reporting as they are business confidential. No confirmed incidents of corruption occurred in 2020. 206-1 Legal actions for anti-competitive behavior, anti-trust, and monopoly practices and their outcomes No anti-trust regulatory or enforcement action was initiated in 2020.

      "54 Linde 2020 Sustainable Development Report 300 Series: Environmental Topics Linde is a resource-intensive company. Linde’s environmental performance year-on-year can best be evaluated on an intensity basis versus revenue. In most cases, this shows a positive trend. In addition, Linde’s business model is resource efficiency — to make more value than it consumes. The environmental and other benefits of Linde applications are described in the \"Business Model\" section on page 6, the \"Creating Economic, Environmental and Social Value\" section on pages 6-7, and the \"Linde Applications Enable >2x Carbon Productivity\" section on page 14. For ease of comparison and to follow Linde’s performance year-on-year, Linde presents a full-year pro forma value for 2018 for each environmental KPI. These 2018 pro forma values are comparable to the 2019 and 2020 numbers, using the same reporting scope, definition and boundaries. Pro forma numbers for 2018 have either been fully re-audited (energy consumption, Scopes 1 and 2) or are calculated from audited 12+2 numbers, where two months of Linde GmbH (previously Linde AG) numbers have been scaled up to a full year (unless otherwise stated). Trend data needs to be understood in the context of the merger. For 2017, data is reported for legacy Praxair only, and this year is not a basis to understand trends. Linde’s reporting boundaries for eKPIs are consistent with the financial reporting boundaries and financial control definition to the greatest extent possible. Linde reports on all eKPIs for all subsidiaries, JVs and other holdings within its organizational boundaries whose revenues and Earnings Before Interests and Taxes (EBIT) are included in Linde’s financial results. Linde does not collect eKPI data for minority holdings and other holdings that are not reporting their financials. EKPIs for JVs, which are not fully consolidated into the company financials (at-equity JVs), are collected but are only included in external GHG reporting under Scope 3. 301-1 Materials used by weight or volume Raw materials are procured through a global procurement organization under global procurement standards and expectations that include requirements for material sustainability. Linde has Supplier Expectations that manage sustainability in its supply chain. Non-Renewable Materials Used Linde estimates that 1 percent by weight of the raw materials used in 2020 were non-renewable, including natural gas and naphtha, which are used in hydrogen production. Linde also builds air separation units (ASUs) and steam methane reformers (SMRs). Construction materials for these are generally from non-renewable sources: aluminum, carbon steel, stainless steel, copper and brass alloys, brass and metals. The largest material by spend is steel. Renewable Materials Used Ninety-nine percent by weight of the raw materials used in 2020 to produce gaseous nitrogen, oxygen, argon, carbon dioxide and hydrogen were renewable raw materials. Renewable raw materials used by Linde include air, water, carbon dioxide and hydrogen. These products represent over 90 percent of the revenue Linde received for the products it manufactures. Examples of products not included are those manufactured by Surface Technologies and low-volume products, such as acetylene. Using air as its raw material, Linde produces oxygen, nitrogen, argon and rare gases through several air separation processes, of which cryogenic air separation is the most prevalent. As air is a renewable natural resource, there is no negative environmental consequence to using this raw material. Process gases, including carbon dioxide, hydrogen, carbon monoxide, helium, specialty gases and acetylene, are produced by methods other than air separation. In many cases, these are sourced as an industrial byproduct or waste. Some of these byproduct sources are renewable, but all offer a means to reuse products that would otherwise have been waste. • Most carbon dioxide is purchased from byproduct sources, including chemical plants, refineries and industrial processes. These byproduct sources include ethanol manufacturing facilities, where the waste carbon dioxide is considered renewable. A portion is recovered from carbon dioxide wells. • Hydrogen and carbon monoxide are produced by either steam methane reforming of natural gas or by purifying byproduct sources obtained from the chemical and petrochemical industries. In 2020, Linde procured 19 percent byproduct hydrogen.\n",
      "Linde 2020 Sustainable Development Report 55 301-1 • Most of the helium sold by Linde is sourced from helium-rich natural gas streams in the U.S., with additional supplies being acquired from outside the U.S. • Acetylene can be produced from calcium carbide and water. A significant percentage is purchased as a chemical byproduct. The volumes of process gases procured are considered business confidential. 301-2 Percentage of materials used that are recycled input materials Also see 301-1 for information on renewable raw materials. As part of its sustainable supply chain program, Linde’s Procurement organization works with vendors to reduce consumption of upstream, non-renewable natural resources. For some of its business lines, Linde actively sources recycled input materials by using byproducts from other industrial processes. The total weight of these byproducts as a percentage of total material use is not reported here. From 2011–2020, most of the acetylene produced by Linde in the U.S. was sourced from byproduct acetylene, avoiding the mining of calcium carbonate and the recycling or disposal of carbide lime. Most Linde carbon dioxide sold in the U.S. was sourced from ethanol fermentation (a biomass source). As a business, Linde is constantly researching innovative ways to expand the use of this application. Most gases are transported in pipelines or trucks, including cylinder trucks, and use little packaging (see 301-3). Linde has a large engineering business, which designs and constructs new production plants. When building a new plant, the focus is put on the re-use of parts/components from other dissembled plants (e.g., refurbished parts) as much as possible. At the end-of-life of a production facility, parts and components are checked, refurbished if required, and directly re-used or put in stock for future usage. Thus, most of the materials are recycled and become input materials (e.g., for new plants). In order to avoid procurement of new materials, the company has established several asset management programs that are actively identifying idle assets (e.g., cylinders) to ensure that they are put back into use rather than purchasing new materials. The programs actively track all assets, are well reported and yielding good results. 301-3 Reclaimed products and their packaging materials Linde produces very little packaging waste. Linde delivers most of its product in pipelines or bulk cylinder trucks. As the products are consumable, there is nothing to reclaim and no packaging material for the majority of products. For the packaged gases product lines, either disposable cylinders or reusable cylinders are utilized. The metal cylinders last about 40 years, are returnable and are typically reused multiple times. In its cylinder test shop in Wolverhampton, UK, with more than 100 employees, Linde refurbishes about 1.8 million cylinders per year in order to avoid unnecessary scrapping. Linde runs several of these large cylinder refurbishment centers worldwide as well as many smaller test shops and repair centers in many countries.\n",
      "56 Linde 2020 Sustainable Development Report 302-1 Energy consumption within the organization Where MWh were converted to GJ, MWh were multiplied by 3.6. Fuel Consumption Linde’s total non-renewable fuel consumption in 2020 was 76.7 million GJ, or 21.3 million MWh. This figure represents energy consumption and excludes fuel consumed as a feedstock for production. Fuel types used included natural gas, diesel, oil and \"other,\" which includes naphtha and other refinery fuel gas. Linde did not consume any renewable fuel in 2020. Electricity Consumed Total non-renewable electricity consumed in 2020 was 39.1 million MWh, or 140.9 million GJ. Total renewable electricity purchased in 2020 was 2.5 million MWh, or 9.0 million GJ. Linde also tracks low carbon electricity, which includes both active and passive renewable electricity as well as nuclear. Active RE is classified as electricity procured through Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs), directly connected 100 percent RE supplier contracts, or validated green energy certificates. Passively procured electricity from the grid was calculated using the latest location-based renewable energy grid factors from the IEA and, where available, plant-specific RE factors according to the supplier contract/utility bill. In 2020, active RE was 2.493 million MWh and passive RE was 9.176 million MWh, for a total of 11.669 million MWh. Nuclear was 4.750 million RE, bringing the total low carbon electricity to 16.419 million MWh of low carbon electricity, which represents 39 percent of Linde’s total electricity consumption in 2020. See page 20 in Performance Towards Targets for information about Linde’s low carbon power sourcing target. Steam Consumed Linde did not consume any heating or cooling in 2020. Linde consumed 6.4 million MWh, or 22.9 million GJ, of steam in 2020. See 102-48 on page 38 for information on steam restatements. Electricity, Heating, Cooling and Steam Sold Linde sold 8.82 million MWh of steam in 2020. Total Energy Consumed Linde consumed a total of 69,277,000 MWh, or 249.4 million GJ, of energy in 2020. This is a 0.2 percent increase from the previous year. While Linde continued to implement energy efficiency projects, energy use was consistent with 2019 mainly due to changes in production volumes brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic: Some plants produced lower volumes of product’ therefore, consumed less energy, while others saw increases in production volumes, with corresponding increases in energy use. Total energy consumed has been restated for 2018 and 2019; see 102-48 on page 38. Linde tracks energy consumption through meters and utility bills, collecting information for each plant and location in a global eKPI system. Newly constructed plants less than two months old and de-minimis locations consuming less than 1,500 MWh are excluded from reporting.\n",

The company considers production volumes to be business confidential. Internally, energy intensity is tracked monthly and is a basis for Linde’s operational GHG intensity targets, see Performance Towards Targets, page 20. 302-4 Reduction of energy consumption Linde has a 7% energy intensity improvement target by 2028 for air separation units, see Performance Towards Targets, page 20. 303-1 Interactions with water as a shared resource 303-2 Management of water discharge-related impacts Note: This section responds to 303-1 and 303-2 Beginning with this report, Linde is reporting against GRI’s Standard 303: Water and Effluents (2018). Using GRI’s definitions of fresh and other water, Linde has restated water values for 2018 and 2019; see 102-48 on page 38. Water sourced from municipal utilities, surface waters and ground water is considered fresh water (<= 1,000 mg/L Total Dissolved Solids); all other sources are considered “other” (> 1,000 mg/L Total Dissolved Solids). For more information on the company’s water impact, interactions with key stakeholders, management approach and commitment to water stewardship, see Linde’s Water Position Statement at https://www.linde.com/sustainable-development/policies-and-position-statements/water- position-statement and the most recent CDP Water Security response at: https://www.linde.com/sustainable-development/2021/cdp-response- climate-water. 303-3 Water withdrawal 303-4 Water discharge 303-5 Water consumption Note: This section responds to 303-3, 303-4, and 303-5 Water Withdrawal In 2020, Linde withdrew 833.2 million m3 of water. Linde tracks water withdrawals primarily through utility bills. No water sources were significantly affected by Linde's withdrawal of water in 2020. Of the 833.2 million m3 of water that Linde withdrew in 2020, 51 percent was from fresh water sources (municipal, surface water and groundwater), 24 percent from seawater, and 25 percent from third-party (industrial/recycled) sources. Linde estimates that more than 90 percent of the water withdrawn in 2020 at Linde production plants (excluding once-through) was recycled numerous times through cooling towers before discharge. Overall, water withdrawal increased 4 percent compared to 2019, mainly due to increased production at certain sites that use water from non-fresh water sources and one new plant startup that uses a significant volume of third-party recycled water. Total water withdrawal from freshwater sources decreased by 6 percent compared to 2019 due to reduced production resulting from COVID-19 as well as continued efforts to improve fresh water use efficiency and implementation of water conservation projects.\n",
      "Linde 2020 Sustainable Development Report 59 303-3, 303-4, 303-5 Water Discharge Linde did not have any unplanned water discharges in 2020. No water bodies or related habitats were significantly affected by Linde water discharges or runoff in 2020. Where Linde facilities discharge process water, discharges are governed by discharge permits issued by a regulatory agency. Linde estimated chemical oxygen demand (COD) at these sites to be 2,007 metric tons in 2020, which is a 5.7 percent decrease from 2019. Linde discharged 759.5 million m3 of water in 2020, of which 43.1 million m3 was wastewater. Linde also discharged once-through cooling water back to the source from which it came. In 2020, 716.4 million m3 of water was discharged in this manner, of which 47 percent was to fresh water sources, 28 percent was to seawater sources, and 25 percent was to third-party sources. Water Consumption Linde consumed 73.7 million m3 of water in 2020. Consumption is defined as total water withdrawn minus wastewater discharged, minus once-though cooling water that is returned to the original source with no impact to quality. Consumption decreased by 11 percent compared to 2019. Consumption of fresh water was 93.1 million m3 in 2020, which is an 8 percent decrease compared to 2019. Overall, consumption decreased due to a combination of water efficiency improvements and more efficient cooling processes. Additionally, water discharge increased, due in part to a new plant startup that returns 100 percent of its water (27 million m3) as once-through cooling water. Water-stressed Areas Linde tracks water withdrawal, discharge and consumption from sites in areas of water stress. Areas of water stress are defined by the WRI Aqueduct Water Risk Atlas. Linde determines sites to be in a water-stressed area if the Atlas lists the baseline water stress as “high” or “extremely high.” See page 21 for information on Linde’s target to implement water management plant at high-water-use sites in areas of water stress.

When planning new sites, processes are in place to ensure that Linde minimizes any potential negative impacts on biodiversity. It follows internationally recognized guidelines when performing its evaluations, such as the Voluntary Guidelines on Biodiversity-Inclusive Impact Assessment issued by the United Nations. Greenhouse Gas Emissions 305-1, 305-2, 305-3, 305-4, 305-5 GHG Inventory Methodology Linde’s GHG emissions disclosures have been prepared based on a reporting year of January 1 to December 31, the same as the financial reporting period. All GHG emissions figures are in metric tons of CO2e and cover six gases: CO2, CH4, N2O, PFCs, HFCs and SF6. Linde does not have emissions of nitrogen trifluoride (NF3). Linde's GHG emissions information was prepared with reference to the World Resources Institute/World Business Council for Sustainable Development's Greenhouse Gas Protocol: A Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard, revised edition (the GHG Protocol®). Global warming potentials (GWPs) are sourced from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Fourth Assessment Report.\n",
      "Linde 2020 Sustainable Development Report 61 • Timelines and Base Year GHG Emissions Linde reports on its eKPIs for the last four years in order to reflect the trend and development of KPIs. Linde defined new sustainable development targets in 2019, which set 2018 as a baseline year for the new company’s targets. Those targets include targets relating to GHG emissions. The basis for those targets is a 2018 full-year pro forma value for the complete merged company according to the final organizational structure. For pro forma information and performance against GHG targets, see the \"Performance Towards Targets\" section, pages 19-20. • Excluded Sources of GHG Emissions Linde has very small office sites and smaller sales outlets (such as retail outlets) with fewer than five people, called “de-minimis” sites. Emissions from these sites are negligible and are therefore not included in the GHG inventory. • Prior Year Revisions The company has restated 2018 and 2019 Scope 2 to reflect an update to the calculation methodology for steam consumption. See 102-48 on page 38. • External Verification Linde’s 2020 GHG inventory was verified by a third party. In 2021, a Limited Assurance was performed on Scopes 1 and 2 and a subset of Scope 3 emissions (2020 calendar year data). A copy of Linde's assurance statement is available at the end of this report. 305-1 Direct greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions (Scope 1) Linde’s total Scope 1 emissions in 2020 were 16,247,000 MT CO2e, which is a decrease of 1.3 percent from 2019. The primary source of Scope 1 emissions for Linde is the combustion of natural gas at hydrogen plants, which represented 10.6 million metric tons of Scope 1 emissions in 2020. Another portion is from ASU plants using natural gas for energy generation, which amounted to 2.1 million metric tons CO2e. Smaller sources of Scope 1 emissions are other GHGs (e.g., from methane plants or nitrous oxide plants) or other types of GHG emissions that are converted into CO2 equivalents. The total of such “other GHG emissions” was 1.5 million metric tons in 2020. Carbon dioxide and other plants caused approximately 1.4 million metric tons. The combustion of diesel and gasoline from transport activities resulted in approximately 0.6 million metric tons CO2e in 2020. Scope 1 Emissions Covered by Emissions-limiting Regulations In 2020, 1,478,000 metric tons of Scope 1 emissions (9 percent) were subject to a form of carbon legislation, over a cap-and-trade scheme, ETS or a form of carbon taxation. Most of this number (more than 80 percent) was covered by the EU ETS scheme; smaller amounts were subject to sub-national regulations like the California CAT scheme or the Singapore carbon tax. For details on the 2020 carbon regulation schemes applicable to Linde, see the Linde CDP report, which will be available at the end of July 2021 at: https://www.linde.com/sustainable-development/2021/cdp-response-climate- change. Calculation Methodology Hydrogen plants, which represent the largest source of Linde’s Scope 1 emissions, consume natural gas, both for fuel and feedstock. To determine Scope 1 emissions, the amount of carbon produced as product is subtracted. In addition, Linde calculates Scope 1 emissions from gases losses (during production and filling processes). These are calculated for nitrous oxide manufacturing and filling facilities, carbon dioxide plants, on-site refrigeration equipment and cylinder filling operations associated with methane (CH4), sulfur hexafluoride (SF6), perfluorocarbons (PFCs), hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) and nitrogen trifluoride (NF3). To calculate Scope 1 emissions from natural gas, Linde uses the reported natural gas factors from each production plant (depending on the mix of hydrocarbons). If a specific natural gas factor is not available or known, Linde uses a chemical natural gas to CO2 conversion factor from the Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs (DEFRA), from the Government of United Kingdom. For other fuels, Linde uses DEFRA factors to convert to CO2 equivalents. Emissions from transport are calculated based on actual kilometers driven for commercial and non-commercial vehicles, multiplied by average emission factors by vehicle type from the “Estimated U.S. Average Vehicle Emissions Rates per Vehicle by Vehicle Type using Gasoline and Diesel (Grams per mile)” from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Office of Transportation and Air Quality, personal communication, Apr. 6, 2018.\n",

These emissions were calculated using the market-based approach. The largest electricity user is ASUs, which account for approximately 90 percent of all electricity used. Linde also calculated Scope 2 emissions for 2020 using the location-based approach, which applies IEA factors and eGRID emission factors in the U.S. Scope 2 emissions calculated with the location-based approach were 20.1 million metric tons CO2e in 2020. The difference between market-based and location-based emissions are mostly due to certain plants where customers provide the electricity to Linde (which Linde purchases). Some of these plants have a very high market-based emissions factor compared to the location-based emissions factor. Organizational Boundary Beginning with 2018 pro forma and going forward, Linde reports on all electricity and its resulting Scope 2 emissions purchased by the company. Electricity for sites where Linde does not pay the utility bill is excluded from its reported electricity number as well as from the reported Scope 2; however, it is tracked internally for operational purposes and for Scope 3 reporting. Calculation Methodology The main methodology for calculating Scope 2 emissions from electricity is the market-based approach, using site-specific emissions factors by plant according to supplier contracts and utility bills where available. For sites where such market-based factors are not known, Linde uses the most recent location-based factors from the IEA and the EPA’s eGRID factors for the U.S. See 102-48 on page 38 for information on restating Scope 2 emissions for 2018 and 2019 due to a methodology change in how Linde calculates steam consumption and corresponding GHG emissions.

      "Linde 2020 Sustainable Development Report 63 Upstream Scope 3 Emissions Linde’s methodologies for upstream Scope 3 emissions are described below. • Fuel- and energy-related activities not included in Scopes 1 or 2 Scope 3 emissions from fuel-and energy-related activities (including upstream emissions from purchased fuel, purchased electricity and transmission and distribution losses) are a significant source of Scope 3 emissions for Linde, as Linde's business is energy-intensive, and energy is a significant cost for Linde. The methodology used is based on the GHG Protocol Corporate Value Chain (Scope 3) Accounting and Reporting Standard, Category 3 for Scope 3 emissions caused in the extraction, production and transportation of fuels and energy purchased by Linde. For electricity, Linde applies IEA factors for transmission and distribution (T&D) losses and DEFRA factors for Well-to-Tank (WTT) to calculate all the Scope 3 GHG emissions released into the atmosphere from the production, processing and delivery of energy. The calculation is done on a site level for each site for which Linde purchases the power. For thermal energy, a global WTT factor for heat and steam from DEFRA is applied. For Scope 3 emissions from transport fuels as well as other fuels consumed (excluding feedstocks), DEFRA factors for fuel- and energy-related emissions are used per relevant category. See 102-48 on page 38 for information on restating Scope 3 emissions for 2018 and 2019 due to a methodology change in how Linde calculates steam consumption and corresponding GHG emissions. • Purchased Goods and Services After electricity and energy (reported as fuel-and energy-related Scope 3), the most important input/raw material used by Linde is natural gas. This represents over 80 percent of Scope 3 emissions from purchased goods and services (the rest is distributed over numerous small items and values). Linde’s Scope 3 number is, therefore, based on this input material only as this represents the majority source of emissions from this category. To calculate Scope 3 emissions from natural gas purchased and used as feedstock, Linde applies the same methodology and calculations as for natural gas purchased as fuel/energy, which is based on the GHG Protocol Corporate Value Chain (Scope 3) Accounting and Reporting Standard, Category 3, for Scope 3 emissions caused in the extraction, production and transportation of fuels and energy. • Capital Goods The principal material Linde procures for capital projects is metal products, mainly steel, followed by electrical equipment and other non-ferrous materials. Linde uses industry emission factors for emissions/spend to calculate its Scope 3 emissions for the most important materials by value. The last calculation of this type of Scope 3 emissions used for 2018 reporting was based on data accumulated from legacy companies. Since annual revenue and the size of the Linde business was similar in 2019 when compared to 2018, the same full-year value for 2018 was carried forward. In 2020, due to limited resources resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, these emissions were estimated by pro-rating revenue. Downstream Scope 3 Emissions Linde’s methodologies for downstream Scope 3 emissions are described below. • Downstream Leased Assets This category includes emissions for assets like smaller on-site facilities where the customer is paying for the power and, in many cases, operating the plant. This also includes several major plants where customers are paying for the power and where Linde is charging a facility fee to the customer. Emissions for those plants where the customer pays for the power are not included in Linde’s Scope 2. HyCO plants/facilities that are owned by Linde are fully reported under Scope 1, regardless of whether they are leased out or independent on who is running the plant or providing the fuel or feedstock. Emissions from leased out or charged out entities are calculated on a plant level, using the same calculation methodology as for calculating indirect/ Scope 2 emissions for other Linde plants. For plants where the customer pays for the power and the plant-specific emissions factors are not known, Linde uses country emission factors from the IEA to calculate indirect emissions for those sites.\n",
      "64 Linde 2020 Sustainable Development Report Emissions from downstream leased assets decreased by 10 percent compared to last year largely due to the COVID-19 pandemic and lower production volumes, which resulted in lower energy use from these plants. • Downstream Transportation and Distribution (Contractor Driving) Contractor miles driven are collected in each country and business or region and tracked. Linde’s Scope 3 emissions resulting from delivery of products by third-party carriers were derived using the same methodology to calculate GHG emissions from owned trucks: Emissions from transport are calculated based on actual kilometers driven for commercial and non-commercial vehicles, multiplied by average emissions factors by vehicle type from the “Estimated U.S. Average Vehicle Emissions Rates per Vehicle by Vehicle Type using Gasoline and Diesel (Grams per mile)” from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Office of Transportation and Air Quality, personal communication, Apr. 6, 2018. • Emissions due to Investments Linde includes in its Scope 1 and 2 reporting only subsidiaries/holdings that are reporting their financials to the company and whose results are consolidated into the company P&L. Holdings/investments that are reporting their results but are not consolidated into the P&L statement (mainly JVs consolidated at-equity) are not considered for Scope 1 and 2 emissions, but are reported as Scope 3 from investments. Linde has large JV operations, especially in China. Linde is calculating its emissions due to investments on a plant level. All JVs are reporting their electricity and other fuel consumption into Linde's environmental reporting system. Linde is then calculating Scope 3 from such investments for all plants in this category, by adding reported direct emissions from HyCO plants and indirect emissions from ASUs and other plants, based on reported electricity consumption, multiplied by a country IEA factor. Linde recalculated emissions in this category for 2018 and 2019 based on the company’s updated methodology for calculating steam consumption; see 102-48 on page 38. Emissions from investments decreased by 12% compared to 2019 due to the COVID-19 pandemic and lower production volumes - which resulted in lower energy use - from these sites. Scope 3 Sources Not Reported Linde does not report emissions in the following categories: upstream transportation and distribution, business travel, employee commuting, upstream leased assets and waste generated in operations. These emissions have been calculated or estimated and were determined to be not relevant due to their very small contribution to Linde's Scope 3 footprint. Linde also does not report emissions from processing of sold products, use of sold products and end-of-life treatment of sold products. Linde is at the beginning of numerous value chains and provides many intermediate products with many downstream applications, each of which has a very different GHG profile. Linde does not estimate the downstream emissions associated with the various end uses of all its products.\n",

      "66 Linde 2020 Sustainable Development Report 305-5 Reduction of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions Scopes 1+2 GHG Emissions Reductions Linde’s total sustainable productivity in 2020 yielded savings equivalent to 576,000 metric tons CO2e. It counts projects where benefits are fully realized as well as projects that were implemented in 2019 and are still accruing benefits. These projects provided GHG savings from enhancing the energy efficiency of buildings, processes and the transportation fleet. Information on the projects, including investment made and cost savings, can be found in Linde’s 2021 CDP response, which is available at: https://www.linde.com/sustainable-development/2021/cdp-response-climate-change. Customer GHG Benefits A subset of Linde applications enabled customers and end users to avoid 85 million metric tons of CO2e in 2020; see pages 14 and 19-20. Such emissions represent avoided emissions, which are sometimes referred to as Scope 4. 305-7 NOx, SOx, and other significant air emissions NOx Emissions The 13.5 percent increase in NOx emissions between 2019 and 2020 was driven by a single facility in Mexico that accounts for more than 75 percent of the company’s NOx emissions. Unlike most ASUs, which rely on grid electricity for power, this facility – due to its remote location – generates its own power using combined cycle gas turbines. During typical maintenance activities, the turbines are shut down, reducing natural gas consumption and corresponding NOx emissions. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, all major maintenance activities in 2020 were suspended. The plant can operate without staff onsite, so to meet social distancing and lockdown recommendations, staff did not come onsite to perform maintenance activities. Instead, the plant continued operating and producing product. Natural gas consumption at this plant was 25 percent higher in 2020 than 2019. If 2020 had been a normal year, with maintenance shutdowns, we estimate this plant’s NOx emissions would have been 3,200 metric tons lower, which would have resulted in a 0.2 percent increase in total NOx emissions in 2020. NOx emissions from all other facilities and activities decreased by 5.7 percent between 2019 and 2020, in line with efforts across the globe to minimize fuel usage and increase the efficiency of transportation activities and combustion processes. SOx Emissions The 8 percent increase in SOx emissions between 2019 and 2020 can be attributed largely to one of Linde's largest plants in Singapore, and the source of 56 percent of Linde's total SOx emissions in 2020. The amount of SOx emissions is proportional to production volumes, as the feedstock contains inorganic sulfur. Production at this plant increased in 2020, as the plant did not discontinue operations during COVID-19 lockdowns, resulting in a 15 percent increase in this plant’s SOx emissions. The Singapore plant uses a sulfur-rich gas as feedstock that is provided by the customer. If Linde did not use this gas, it would likely be burned as fuel and 100 percent of the sulfur would be emitted. Instead, Linde uses the gas and has an air pollution control device installed on the plant, which captures more than 10 times the amount of sulfur than the plant emits. VOC Emissions VOC emissions decreased between 2019 and 2020 by nearly 19 percent, mainly due to the COVID-19 pandemic resulting in lower production volumes at plants with VOC emissions and decreases in transportation activities. Calculation Methodology NOx, SOx and VOC emissions from plants are taken from emissions monitoring systems or are estimated based on operations data where emissions monitoring is not required by local regulations. SOx emissions from transport are estimated based on sulfur concentration in local fuel using local transport knowledge and legislative limits. NOx and VOC emissions from transport are calculated based on estimated diesel consumption rates and local regulatory limits. Emissions factors are sourced from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Inventory of U.S. Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Sinks: 1990-2005. See 102-48 on page 38 for information on restated NOx emissions.\n"

Linde tracks the amount of hazardous waste recycled but does not track the portion of this that is sold. Linde estimates that about half of recycled hazardous waste is marketable. In 2020, Linde recycled 9,800 metric tons of hazardous waste, including 4,900 metric tons of marketable and 4,900 metric tons of non-marketable hazardous waste. Linde reports the half that is not marketable in the table below in as part of “hazardous waste generated.” In 2020, total hazardous waste generated (which does not include hazardous waste that is sold for recycling, as this is considered a product) was 24,900 metric tons, which is a 9 percent decrease from 2019, largely due to plant closures driven by the COVID-19 pandemic. Non-hazardous Waste Total non-hazardous waste disposed in 2020 was 30,800 metric tons, which is a 7 percent increase from 2019. The main reasons for the significant increase are: 1) a site closure in Sweden that resulted in a significant amount of waste from disposing of equipment, and 2) downtime during the COVID-19 pandemic allowed several sites to dispose of waste that would otherwise have been stored until the following year. Zero Waste Program Linde is committed to reducing hazardous and non-hazardous waste. Linde’s Zero Waste program is an effort that has existed for more than a decade. Sites work to divert at least 90 percent of the normal waste from going to landfill. The program encourages a practice, prioritizing reduction of waste generation at the source. Therefore, in addition to recycling and other reclamation efforts, many sites have incorporated initiatives that not only reduce waste but also extend conservation principles in the community and help foster economic opportunity. By the end 2020, more than 500 sites participated in the program, collectively diverting approximately 150 million pounds from landfill. See page 22 of this report for information on the Zero Waste Program and performance against the SD 2028 Zero Waste target.

      "70 Linde 2020 Sustainable Development Report 401-2 Benefits provided to full-time employees that are not provided to temporary or part-time employees, by significant locations of operation The company offers a high-performance culture, values ambitious and creative employees, and incentivizes and rewards good performance. Employees can expect to receive a competitive pay package that recognizes the experience, skills and abilities they bring to the company. Training and development are offered, as well as a full range of benefit programs ranging from wellness to work-life balance. Benefits are available to all full-time employees—in the U.S., those working more than 20 hours per week—and vary according to business unit. Paid vacations and holidays, life and accident insurance, healthcare, disability/invalidity coverage, primary caregiver leave (maternity/paternity leave, including for adoption), flextime, education reimbursement, wellness allowances and a range of personal and family insurance policies, options for professional services (legal, counseling, medical care, childcare, eldercare), purchasing subsidies (personal office equipment and supplies, gym membership/equipment) and retirement provisions are some of the types of benefits provided to employees of the organization. Many specific program descriptions here apply to U.S. programs, but equivalent programs may be offered in each country and referenced on that country's careers website. These benefits are generally not provided to temporary or part-time employees by major operations. 403-3 • Flexible Work: The company understands that everyone has commitments outside of work. Recognizing this, the company has global policies that provide work arrangements that help employees meet enduring or shorter-term personal needs through formal and informal means. For example, in the U.S., Linde offers paid personal days and a Flexible Work Policy that allows flexible scheduling. • Work/Life: The company offers a confidential resource and referral service for practical advice and referrals related to parenting and childcare, eldercare, financial and college planning, retirement planning, survivor support programs and more. Facilities offer accommodations to employees. Employee assistance programs are offered in many locations, including in the U.S. and in the U.K. • Health and Wellness: A range of activities are offered to all employees to support employee health and wellness. They include seminars on such diverse topics as financial health/retirement; stress management information and stress management/reduction techniques and training; sleep management; managing work-life issues such as a family member with Alzheimer's disease; community engagement; office picnics/parties; and \"bring your child to work day.\" Some activities are managed by an Employee Activity Council or similar and vary by site. For those participating in the company medical plan in the U.S., benefits include a Healthy Living Plan, nutritional/health support and a 24-hour nursing consultation. Some sites also have on-site fitness programs. In the U.K. for example, cycle to work programs are also offered. Some sites have onsite health or wellness personnel for occupational health. 403-3, 403-6 • Volunteerism: Linde is committed to supporting the communities around the world where its employees live and work. Employees are encouraged to participate in volunteerism and community engagement activities. Its Global Giving Program provides substantial matches to a range of employee giving. Community engagement is part of the company culture, and employees at all levels of the company contribute their time and skills to help build resilient communities. Corporate policies allow employees to volunteer during work hours with the support of their managers. Options for employees include employee-driven projects, giving campaigns such as the annual United Way campaign held at various locations, and the year-round matching gift program. The matching gifts program provides a 100-percent match for all eligible donations, up to $15,000. It was previously available to employees in the United States; a similar program has also been extended to other regions. 401-3 Return to work and retention rates after parental leave, by gender Subject to country or region's laws, Linde employees of either gender are entitled to parental leave or benefit entitlement that may be used for parental leave purposes. Additional employee benefits and entitlements in the U.S. fall under the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) and Short-Term Disability (STD). To be eligible for FMLA leave benefits of 12 weeks in a year, an employee must meet some eligibility requirements, for example, time worked for the company (12 months). The FMLA covers birth, adoption or foster care of an employee's child within 12 months after the birth or placement of the child (\"Bonding Leave\"); care for an immediate family member (spouse, child or parent) with a serious health condition (\"Family Care Leave\"); and an employee's inability to work because of a serious health condition (\"Serious Health Condition Leave\"). Other countries have equivalent programs. In the United States, full-time employees, having one year or more of service, who are parents of newly birthed or adopted children are eligible for a Primary Caregiver Leave, which allows parents of newly birthed or adopted children up to 10 weeks of leave. This includes four weeks of paid leave in addition to any disability benefits that may be available. In addition, subject to management's discretions, all new parents may request flexibility or accommodations in the six months after birth or adoption. At this time, the company does not report on the number of employees who took parental leave or their return to work retention rates.\n",
      "Linde 2020 Sustainable Development Report 71 402-1 Minimum notice periods regarding operational changes, including whether these are specified in collective agreements Note: This section responds to 402-1 and also responds to 102-41 and 403-4. Linde considers relations with its employees to be excellent. Linde's CBI and Human Rights policy makes clear the company's commitment and management processes to address relevant areas of human rights concern, including freedom of association and freedom of peaceful assembly and the freedom to choose whether to engage in collective bargaining or to participate in works agreements in various countries. An estimated thirty-two percent of Linde employees worldwide belong to an independent trade union or are covered by collective bargaining agreements or are members of work councils. The company has collective bargaining agreements with unions at numerous locations throughout the world, which expire at various dates. Most of the company's labor agreements have language that defines severance arrangements. In countries or companies where employees have third-party representation via a works council or collective bargaining, the company respects these relationships and works with these third parties in a mutually respectful manner. In the case of work councils, the company meets any predetermined notice periods mutually agreed to by the parties. 102-41 As a matter of business practice, the company keeps employees well informed of operational changes through normal internal communications channels, most notably its corporate intranet, through which global/corporate information and business unit information (in home country language) is provided directly to employees. Business leaders also communicate through regular channels that include periodic business teleconferences, newsletters and issue communications. The company makes every effort to be proactive and to provide reasonable notice to all employees if a significant change occurs, and it has a good record of employee relations in countries where it does business. 403-9 Work-related Injuries Note: This section also responds to 403-6. Key KPIs for Linde's safety performance include days away from work (lost workday case rate), and the tracking of illnesses and injuries, including fatalities and occupational diseases. These and other safety key figures are reported monthly to the Office of the Chairman. In addition, Linde's full Board of Directors has responsibility to review safety and environmental risk at each Board meeting. The Board has established a strategic business objective to maintain best-in-class performance in safety. Accidents and near misses are closely monitored, reported and investigated. Evaluations of these events are performed, and the lessons learned are communicated in safety training and special safety alerts for the relevant work groups. The benefit of these continuous efforts is that Linde's employee and contractor safety performance continues to be better than general industry benchmarks and among the best within the industrial gases and chemical industry. To promote continuous improvement and recognize efforts contributing to a safe working environment, Linde recognizes its businesses through safety awards for reduction in recordable injuries, lost workday cases and/or product vehicle accidents. In addition, Linde annually holds a global \"Safety Commitment Day,\" which provides information about different safety issues and various workshops around safety. External contractors are also invited to join in safety programming. In 2020, Linde also translated safety principles to reflect the COVID-19 pandemic and introduced safety protocols and measures due to the worldwide pandemic. 403-6 Linde also promotes a healthy work environment by providing employees with information on ergonomics and lighting considerations. Linde controls workplace environmental factors, including noise, lighting, indoor air quality, humidity and temperature. 403-6 Linde reports safety rates for Praxair in 2017, Linde pro forma for 2018, and Linde consolidated for 2019 and 2020. See tables SOC (3) and SOC (5). Contractor lost workday case rates are reported for construction contractors. See SOC (4).For ease to stakeholders, the company also reports lost time injury frequency rate (LTIFR) for employees and contractors and rates for Tier 1 process safety events in units of per million work hours.

      "74 Linde 2020 Sustainable Development Report 404-1 Average hours of training per year per employee by gender, and by employee category Business Benefits from Training and Education Like many companies, Linde must attract, hire and retain qualified personnel to develop, market or sell its products or successfully manage its business. Linde is dependent upon its highly skilled, experienced and efficient workforce to be successful. Much of Linde's competitive advantage is based on the expertise and experience of its key personnel in marketing, technology, manufacturing, distribution infrastructure, systems and products. The inability to attract and hire qualified individuals, or the loss of key employees in very skilled areas, could have a negative effect on the company's financial results. Investments in employee training and development bring value, but this is often hard to measure, or of indirect business benefit. The challenge in this area is to create training interventions that bring direct learning and measurable business benefits. One example of the company’s investment in development training demonstrates the multiple values of employee development programs to employees and to the company. The Talent Development team has conducted needs assessments to ensure that potential programs met the needs of the company. One key goal was to increase the engagement and efficiency of the company’s people managers. Some key e-learning initiatives resulted, and these programs are now increasingly employing technology in training and development. Two examples of continued deployment of e- learning include the use of Skillsoft and the “Inclusion Boost” program. Due to the global pandemic, the use of e-learning and virtual platforms became the dominant mode of training, with widespread utilization in areas including compliance training, safety training, and inclusion. Examples below depict typical programs offered, although all may not have been offered in 2020 due to constraints due to the pandemic. Many e-learning programs exist throughout the globe: The APAC team piloted an online platform to increase digitalization skills. Nearly 500 employees have participated in this pilot, and similar programming continues across the globe. Employee Learning and Development The careers and career paths of Linde employees are strategically managed. Employees and management use a range of competence-based and goal- setting tools. Employees store and maintain resumes, experience, completed training, certifications achieved, performance appraisals and career goals and aspirations. Career paths are planned in conversations with their managers against competency ladders. These plans are used for talent development and succession planning and in internal recruitment. Linde has invested in Learning Management System (LMS) software that facilitates global reporting of formal training. The data reported below is a subset of all the company-sponsored formal training provided. The LMS system enables all businesses and functions to house, track and offer training and training-related information on a single enterprise platform. Linde expanded the system in 2020. Linde reports an average of 9 hours of training globally (regional average); however, these hours vary depending on training needs and budgets. See SOC (8). In 2020, the company continued to expand the use of technology to offer significant training with increased efficiency of time and cost: • The company’s e-learning offerings have reached more than 3,500 employees. Nearly 26,000 courses, videos and other resources were taken, representing more than 60,000 training hours. • The company continued the use of e-learning for business integrity and sustainability training. Globally, this is typically more than 20,000 employees. When added to standard compliance training and safety training, employees received an average of 59 hours of training in 2020. See SOC (9). This training consists of: 1. Ethics and compliance training: This is mandatory at all levels. The average employee receives 2 hours of training each year. 2. Employee development training: Linde employees received an average of 9 hours of formal training in 2020. 3. Professional skills training: Employees in specific businesses and functions receive additional training as needed or requested. 4. Management and development training: The company also provided additional management and development training as needed or requested. Safety Training 403-5 Linde is committed to providing its employees with a safe operating environment by investing in state-of-the-art technology and driving a culture in which safety is the top priority. Accordingly, the company rigorously focuses on training to prevent work-related risks and/or occupational health hazards for employees, their families, contractors and, in many cases, for community members. Its industry-leading safety performance is the result of a program of continuous training and communication using a wide range of media.\n",
      "Linde 2020 Sustainable Development Report 75 In 2020, Linde invested nearly 5 million hours in safety training for its employees and contractors. The average Linde employee (at facilities and offices) received approximately 48 hours of formal safety training in 2020. (See 204-1 for information on safety training for contractors.) 403-5 All sites in all regions and business units have periodic safety meetings and an annual Safety Commitment Program, which is held at every facility globally and represents Linde’s commitment to safety (operations are shut down for Safety Commitment Programs). There are periodic \"stand-down\" meetings when operations are stopped for a safety program, continuous short \"toolbox\" reviews, and additional annual training for specific job functions and for compliance purposes. In addition, Linde conducts general safety training and communication through a range of global, regional and site-based channels on a needs basis, for example, in relation to safety changes in different seasons, a worldwide health threat or to communicate learnings after a safety incident. Safety training is conducted for all employees, in all functions. Cultural Awareness, Diversity and Inclusion, and Unconscious Bias Training Training is one of the four key tenets of Linde's diversity and inclusion strategy. Accordingly, training is offered globally through multiple platforms, with various contents and to various levels across the organization. Diversity and inclusion training goals are to enhance managerial and leadership capabilities in understanding the business case for diversity and building inclusive leadership skillsets, and also equipping employees to effectively manage talent in a multicultural, increasingly diverse environment. Classroom training and e-learning are used to enhance personal and managerial skills and are offered on a mandatory and voluntary basis. Since 2015, the company has implemented unconscious bias training and tools for managers; more than 1,200 global managers have received this training. “Inclusion Boost” was introduced in 2018. This self-directed training uses videos to reinforce inclusion initiatives and prior unconscious bias training. In a series of short videos, employees can learn, reflect and share. More than 2,000 employees have participated in this training. In South Latin America, Radar do Saber—translated as “Knowledge Radar”—sessions focus on various diversity topics. Examples of issues addressed in the last two years are “Green September,” to increase awareness of issues regarding people with disabilities; “Pink October” and “Blue November”, focused on women's and men's health and “Orange December” to highlight the importance of combating violence against women. Informal diversity training is also offered at all global locations, embedded within celebrations of Global Diversity Day and International Women's Day events, during which time the company offers learning webinars and inclusion activities. The company also celebrates heritage days around the world to recognize the global diversity of its employees. Leadership and Skills Development Classroom training is only part of the education that employees receive. Mentoring, networking, skills training and work experience are all designed to enhance employee career opportunities. Some employees receive formal mentoring, and there are various networks for employees to join based on interest (e.g., Toastmasters clubs or \"Success Network\" events). Eligible employees receive tuition reimbursement for approved studies, including university degrees. Following are highlights of additional initiatives that promote the career development of employees: • Widespread e-learning opportunities to increase technical and managerial skills and for personal development. • The Personal Development Center, for example, provides online coaching and tools for developing competencies used in annual performance evaluations, and other valued skills. • An enterprise-wide LMS system enables all businesses and functions to house, track and offer training and training-related information on a single enterprise platform. Business Programs The company's commercial and corporate programs offer challenging projects that help prepare dynamic sales and corporate talent within the business. Examples include the following rotational programs: • Commercial Development Programs - Lincare’s Sales Representative Training Program: This 10-day program prepares sales team members with customer relationship management tools, as well as clinical knowledge. - Commercial Leadership Program (CLP): The CLP is designed to expose employees to key areas within the company's sales arena and cylinder gas business. - Leadership and Technical Orientation Program (LTOP): LTOP is a one-year program designed to introduce employees to the operations and commercial aspects of the America’s gases business in the U.S., such as plant startups or shutdowns, maintenance, project planning and execution, project management, sales and planning.\n",
      "76 Linde 2020 Sustainable Development Report - International Leadership Development Program (ILDP): ILDP is a two-year international program designed to expose attendees to key business areas and help them to build their skills. Rotations can be across several functions, including the financial, business development and marketing areas. • Corporate Development Programs - Leading in Linde (LIL): This three-day supervisory skills program is offered in all geographies. To date, more than 2,300 managers have benefitted from this training, helping them to expand their managerial skills. This program allows the company to standardize managerial practices around the world. - Career Development Program (CDP): This program was developed for early-career employees. \"Train the Trainer\" sessions for regional groups provide the capability to deliver the CDP to more employees, as millennials continue to enter the workforce. - General Managers Program (GMP): This program teaches employees how to create value using experiential techniques. The program enhances employees' ability to operate in a competitive business environment. - The Global Leadership Program (GLP): This program helps prepare future executives to develop the business management and leadership skills required to achieve both short- and long-term business objectives. Participants work to understand their leadership strengths and weaknesses and to develop the potential of their own direct reports. Digitalization: Developing Skills for the Future Linde also makes investments in employees so that they are prepared for the increasingly fast-moving and data-intensive world and better grasp opportunities from digitalization. Over the last three years, Linde has introduced “digital transformation” programs. The cornerstone program involves a three-month session, which includes coaching, immediately followed by opportunities to put the concepts into practice. The program includes digital boot camps, introduction to AGILE frameworks, demystification of digital technologies and use cases. The team’s focus is on solving real business challenges utilizing new methodologies, tools and digital technologies. They also explore alternative and more efficient modes of technology platforms. A key goal of the sessions is to simplify processes and to build digital solutions, products and tools that move decision-making from descriptive to predictive. This program continued in 2020, and to date, more than 1,000 cross-functional employees from all areas of the business have participated in these programs and increased their digital capabilities. Projects implemented have resulted in productivity improvements and new ways to solve business challenges. This indicator is partially reported. Linde businesses are responsible for HR management at their respective regional level. Key metrics are consolidated at the global level and reported here.

Examples include: • Linde-provided training programs and university courses with a work experience element for young people, as well as training opportunities in various technical and commercial areas. In Germany, the company has offered vocational training in dozens of different professions. Many of the apprentices and student trainees have been offered job opportunities. • The Emerging Leader Program is targeted at managers in transition (from first-line managers to middle managers). It was launched in 2018 in all three segments with 60 people participating. • Eligible employees receive tuition reimbursement for eligible studies such as an MBA. • Linde Engineering’s Project Execution Academy (PEA) provides an opportunity for project managers to gain industry-recognized Project Management Professional (PMP) credentials. This fosters a better understanding of the project execution process and leads to better preparation to lead company construction projects. Several learning and development tools are made available to employees allowing them to develop professional and interpersonal skills. Employees participate in industry conferences and seminars that facilitate best-practice sharing and professional networking. The company’s financial services vendor routinely offers on-line and in-office seminars on financial planning, including financial planning for employees approaching retirement, in some areas. In the U.S., under the company's generally applicable severance plan, if employment terminates for certain reasons, U.S. employees are generally eligible for severance benefits of up to a maximum of 26 weeks of base pay, depending on their completed years of service. In addition to retirement savings plan benefits, the company offers access to financial planning tools and resources to aid in transition to retirement. 404-3 Percentage of employees receiving regular performance and career development reviews Talent Management At least annually, all eligible Linde employees meet formally with their supervisors to review their performance and development opportunities. Employees receive a performance appraisal through the systematic use of agreed-upon measurable targets and a multi-dimensional performance appraisal. Performance reviews and development plans are a part of a global talent management system, which is designed to effectively utilize and advance employees across all regions. Performance Every year, Linde ensures that managers and employees measure the results of individual objectives, creating a transparent link between performance and rewards. All employees around the world are expected to obtain results and demonstrate a series of competencies and behaviors that support the local business strategy. The company's performance management process is designed to: • Ensure alignment between employee and business unit/function goals. • Enhance communication between employees and managers. • Promote meaningful assessment and evaluation of individual performance. • Promote alignment between individual performance and pay. The focus on continuous improvement allows employees to update goals based upon business needs. This fosters collaboration between managers and employees. Goals are the driving force behind achievement and provide an opportunity to challenge employees and improve their skills. Goals serve the needs of the company and aid in the development of employees. 405-1 Diversity of governance bodies and employees Global Diversity and Inclusion is a formal support function operating under Corporate HR and develops strategies and initiatives within four pillars: Talent Management, Inclusive Culture, Managerial Training and Marketplace Branding.

This oversight, which includes quarterly reviews, provides accountability for business leaders and ensures that diversity and inclusion is sustained as a top priority for the organization's long-term growth and viability. Each subsidiary and business is held accountable through the development and implementation of an annual Diversity Action Plan that includes both qualitative and quantitative aspirational goals. Among other things, Linde (1) sponsors talent pipeline initiatives, including employee resource groups, for diverse talent segments; (2) celebrates heritage days and cultural awareness events; (3) offers Inclusive Leadership and Unconscious Bias training to employees; and (4) brands itself through social media and other forms of external communications. See also 404-1. SOC (10) provides current and historical information on diversity to the Board, global senior leadership team and CEO senior management team. The Linde Board of Directors consists of 12 members, including its CEO. In 2020, all were over 50 years old. Of the 12 Board members, three (25 percent) are female, and one board member is African-American. In 2020, three-quarters of executive officers were over the age of 50, and one-quarter was 50 or below. Globally, the percentage of women employees is 27 percent. Linde is committed to sourcing and retaining local talent, particularly in its emerging economy countries. The company does not currently report global diversity breakdowns in all the ways requested in the GRI Standards. In addition, Linde reports on the age distribution of its global workforce in the following categories: silent generation (those born in 1945 or before); baby boomers (those born from 1946 to 1964); generation X (those born from 1965 to 1980); millennials (those born from 1981 to 1996); and generation Z (those born in 1997 or later).

As part of its compensation program, Linde conducts annual pay equity analyses in the U.S. and in other countries where required by law. Linde disclosed compensation information for named executive officers, both men and women, as well as the ratio of CEO pay to the median employee. See Linde’s 2021 Proxy statement, pages 59 and 76. Other specific salary information is confidential. 406-1 Incidents of discrimination and corrective actions taken Discrimination is prohibited by company policies. The Board of Directors has approved the CBI and related program(s) to provide additional, specific business conduct guidance to employees. Linde is committed to recruiting, hiring, compensating and promoting people based solely on their abilities, performance and qualifications for their jobs, and to maintaining a professional work environment in which employees are treated with respect and dignity. As part of its commitment to equal employment opportunity, the company prohibits discrimination or harassment based on race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, disability, veteran status, pregnancy or gender identity or expression. This prohibition is applicable to all employees worldwide whether such behavior is prohibited by the laws in the regions where it operates. The company is also committed to complying fully with applicable labor and employment laws wherever it operates. The company takes these standards very seriously, and any non-compliance, depending on the circumstances, can result in serious disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment. Information was distributed to employees worldwide to outline management's expectation of ethical conduct and integrity wherever Linde does business. Employees are required to annually certify that they have read and understood the material. This was conducted in 2020. Employees are expected to report suspected complaints, concerns and violations through a number of channels, including the Linde Integrity Hotline. Reports may be made anonymously. All reports to the hotline are appropriately investigated and satisfactorily closed. It is a violation of company policy for any person to retaliate against any individual who has reported such a matter in good faith. Reports to the company’s Integrity Hotline include, but are not limited to, potential human rights violations and potential incidents of alleged discrimination involving internal and/or external stakeholders across operations in the reporting period. See 412-1, 412-2, 414-1 and 414-2. The year 2019 was the first year Linde reports for the consolidated company, and 2020 data is on the same basis.

Linde’s CBI, Human Rights Policy, Corporate HSE Policy and Supplier Code, as well as other corporate and country-level policies, make clear the company’s commitment and management processes to address relevant areas of potential human rights concern. These include: freedom of peaceful assembly, including freedom to choose whether to engage in collective bargaining, and employees’ participation in works agreements in various countries. Linde's Supplier Code of Conduct makes clear that suppliers are expected to recognize, as far as legally permitted, the right of free association and collective bargaining of employees. For actions taken, see 412-2. 408-1 Operations and suppliers identified as having significant risk for incidents of child labor Linde’s CBI, Human Rights Policy and Corporate HSE Policy, as well as other corporate and country-level policies, make clear the company’s commitment and management processes to address relevant areas of potential human rights concern.

      "Linde 2020 Sustainable Development Report 81 411-1 Incidents of violations involving rights of indigenous peoples In 2020, there were no determinations of Linde's operations precluding employees from their rights to freedom of association, there was no likelihood of incidences of child labor or forced labor, and Linde was not involved in any incidents of violation of the rights of indigenous people, so action was not required. 412-1 Operations that have been subject to human rights reviews or impact assessments An \"adverse human rights impact\" occurs when an action removes or reduces the ability of an individual to enjoy his or her human rights. Both because it is consistent with the company's values and because of potential risk, Linde actively seeks to avoid causing or contributing to adverse human rights impacts through its own activities with its employees, contractors and suppliers, and also with JVs, including those over which the company does not have management control. Linde may be required to address human rights impacts when required by national regulation and may choose to take voluntary action to support its values and reputation, even if the company has not contributed to those impacts. Operational human rights issues include those connected to employee and contractor work conditions (e.g., safety, training, personal protective and other safety equipment, the prohibition of forced or child labor, and if appropriate, access to housing and to clean and sanitary facilities) and worker wellness (inclusion, development opportunities, diversity, access to healthcare and appropriate facilities). These are assured as part of the company's normal management processes in 100 percent of its sites and offices globally, as well as in JVs where it has management control. One hundred percent of operations were reviewed. This exceeds 1,000 sites. 412-1 Human rights issues also may arise in Linde’s value chain — among Linde’s suppliers, customers or communities. For these and general human rights issues management, see 414-1 and 414-2. 412-2 Employee training on human rights policies or procedures One hundred percent of targeted employees are trained annually in Linde’s CBI, which deals specifically with human rights. Assuming a minimum of hour per person, this amounts to a minimum of 50,000 hours. In addition, 100 percent of employees are trained in relevant issues pertaining to safety and diversity and inclusion. Training in Human Rights Relevant to Linde’s Value Chain One hundred percent of construction contractors and 100 percent of contract truck drivers are trained in Linde’s operational safety requirements. Linde has identified a salient human rights risk that it has an opportunity to help mitigate — the crime of sex trafficking along long-haul truck routes. Linde has worked with leading non-governmental organizations (NGOs) in the Americas to bring awareness of this crime to its drivers, contract drivers, management and employees. Since 2012, more than 5,000 employees and contractors have been trained across Linde Americas. Detail was provided in Linde’s 2018 Sustainable Development Report. 412-3 Significant investment agreements and contracts that include human rights clauses or that underwent human rights screening One hundred percent of significant investment decisions incorporated human rights screening in keeping with Linde’s CBI. Potential investment agreements that would violate this policy are not pursued. This includes capital investments and acquisitions. 413-1 Percentage of operations with implemented local community engagement, impact assessments and development programs Community is a core value at Linde: We are committed to improving the communities where we live and work. Our charitable contributions, along with employee volunteerism, support initiatives that make important and sustainable contributions to our world.\n",
      "82 Linde 2020 Sustainable Development Report 413-1 The company’s commitment to community is executed through two philanthropic program arms: • Community engagement represents employee- and corporate-led programmatic efforts in communities where the company has a presence. • Charitable contributions through Linde's Global Giving Program, which provides financial, philanthropic support in the form of scholarships, contributions and support for employee volunteerism and matching gifts. Both of these strategic arms are aligned and work together to provide a significant, lasting value to local communities, to positively impact the company's reputation, and to develop and engage employees. Strategically, the programs work to deepen impact, engage employees and drive business goals, complementing the corporate mission of making our world more productive. In Linde, many community engagement projects are also supported by the Global Giving Program. This financial support helps volunteer projects to potentially have more far-reaching, long-term impact. One hundred percent of Linde businesses participated in employee volunteer community engagement activities in 2020. 413-1 Businesses also provide charitable development through the company’s Global Giving Program. Impact assessments are performed on all reported community engagement efforts and on significant and long-term projects supported by the Global Giving Program. 413-1 Community Engagement Overview and Strategic Focus Since being formally launched in 2009, community engagement remains strong. In 2020, all Linde businesses participated in employee volunteer community engagement activities, and Linde employees spearheaded approximately 317 projects across the globe. These projects represent the efforts of approximately 300 sites. Frequently, sites collaborate on projects. In 2020, 17 percent of Linde community engagement projects were sponsored by more than one site. The incidence of volunteerism — a measure of the number of times individual employees engaged with the community — reached more than 5,000. The company has a healthy mix of established projects and a growing pipeline of new efforts launched to address changing needs. Approximately 7 percent of projects have continued for more than 10 years, and approximately one-third of projects in 2020 were new initiatives. Community engagement projects are classified by focus areas: environment, health, education, diversity and general community support. These focus areas parallel the focus areas of the Global Giving Program. See SOC (13) and EC(2). More than one-third of community engagement projects are in the priority focus areas of education, diversity and environment. These support the strategic priorities aligned with the business: Education—especially STEM education—and diversity are critical to a robust, talented pipeline. As well, environmental responsibility is a key priority for the company. In addition to several climate change targets, the SD 2028 targets include targets for diversity and increased philanthropic spend in the area of environment. Examples of company projects include: • Education: Education Sponsorship Program: Over several years, the increased effort of Linde’s Engineering team in India’s Vadodara district has resulted in deep collaborations with the community, as exemplified with the unveiling of the Bhayali Girl's Primary School. This new school helps to foster a new learning environment for girls in the community and is expected to be one step toward lifelong success, confidence and increased self-sufficiency. • Diversity - MLK Literacy Kits: Linde employees in the United States donate books annually to support literacy in honor of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. holiday. - In North and South America, employees mentor underserved populations to help encourage career awareness and preparation. • Environment Earth Week celebration: In Toulouse, France, in addition to conservation activities, members of PST’s team donated items to healthcare workers as a part of the Earth Week program. Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), Linde's SD 2028 Goals and Community Engagement Community engagement efforts seek to make a lasting impact on communities and to address enduring problems. Linde has tracked projects against the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) for the past several years.\n",
      "Linde 2020 Sustainable Development Report 83 Linde's community engagement program supports the SDGs. More than 90 percent of the community engagement projects addressed specific SDGs. These foci also reflect congruence with Linde's priority areas, focusing on development in the areas of environment, diversity/inclusion and education. Several programs contribute to SDG 8: Decent work and economic growth (to achieve decent work and employment for men and women by 2030) and its subsets. The company’s SKILLS PIPELINE™ workforce development program is directly tied to the SDG for decent work and economic growth (to achieve decent work and employment for men and women by 2030). In 2016, the program was expanded from the Louisiana inaugural effort to China. In 2017, the program was expanded to Indiana in the area of advanced manufacturing. In 2018, the program was further expanded to other geographies in welding. In 2019, the program expanded to professional truck driving, in a program focused on transitioning soldiers. In addition to the driving program, with the help of collaborating colleges, two other programs continued during the pandemic in 2020: First, the program’s offering for dual-credit students in East Chicago, IN, which provides an early start to college and preparation for careers in production maintenance technology, continued into 2021. In addition, the advanced manufacturing program in Danbury, CT, welcomed a second cohort. In 2021, Linde looks forward to further geographic and skills area expansion for this program. Recognition and Incentives to Grow Impact Enthusiasm for community engagement is complemented by Linde's global award for Community Engagement. Introduced in 2009, this recognition from Linde's CEO honors successful efforts that demonstrate a high level of commitment and impact. In 2020, exemplary projects from each business or region were recognized, along with five global winners. Award-winning project teams are honored and receive a significant charitable donation. Projects are recognized for outcomes as well as strategic alignment with company goals. Charitable awards, when possible, are designated to the original beneficiary organization to enable the project teams to deepen their efforts, and, ultimately, to increase the impact to communities. Strategy Three strategic elements for community engagement are deepen, engage and drive. • Deepen Community need is a primary driver of community engagement. Projects are dictated by the needs of local communities combined with the desire and ability of local project teams to help address these needs. Linde community engagement is a proactive outreach to help build community resilience. In order to facilitate needs assessment, the company has conducted training on incorporating community needs assessments when determining projects, and guidance for needs assessment is included in the community engagement reporting tool. Sites are encouraged to build strong relationships with local communities. In order to identify and meet local needs, community engagement is frequently conducted with partners, including local government agencies, suppliers, customers and community groups. These partnerships help deepen and extend the ability to help build resilient communities. • Engage Community engagement is considered a leadership activity and is initiated by volunteers. It is also a way to increase awareness of community needs. Linde often incorporates community engagement at company-sponsored meetings and conferences, and the company uses these events to develop employee skills and company networks; the company has done so formally since 2012. With the support and participation of business leaders, these events continue to spur additional community engagement participation in locations around the globe. A hallmark of engagement at Linde has been the annual Earth Week celebration. In place formally since 2012, Earth Week is an opportunity for employees and teams around the world to engage in personal and corporate acts of environmental responsibility, mirroring the culture at Linde every day. Projects often involve community activities, including tree planting, roadside clean-ups and school educational events. Employees also share individual environmentally-friendly acts. Linde's Global Giving Program then \"matches\" each act with a donation.\n",
      "84 Linde 2020 Sustainable Development Report The 2020 Earth Week celebration at Linde reflected the EarthDay Network theme, Global Citizenship and Science. Due to the COVID-19 health crisis, the focus of participation shifted from local activities and projects to online donation support by sharing personal acts of kindness. The emphasis was on sharing the gift of science with local children, schools, families and communities – in a time when many children were sheltered at home. In addition, Linde employees could share photos of rainbows as a global sign of hope. Thousands of employees worldwide participated on Linde’s Earth Week site. These voluntary actions resulted in donations to Seed Programs International, supporting up to 75,000 pounds of vegetables in areas where hunger is a pressing concern. Linde’s Earth Week donations have supported irrigation and gardening projects with the AMDAE organization in Colombia (Asociación Mutual para el Desarrollo integral de la Afrocolombianidad y el Empresarismo). The goal of the project is to help integrate displaced members of the Afro-Colombian community into their new homes in other parts of Colombia. The goal of the farm is to house, feed and economically support 40 people. They integrate knowledge and customs from their past into modern farming techniques. The farm is a cultural learning center available to all Colombians. The model farm shares all aspects of Afro-Colombian culture with the general community. Such programs not only have social impact, but also environmental impact. They also support Linde’s strategic goal to engage employees. In addition to the camaraderie, community engagement also helps to develop leadership and other beneficial skills for all employees. Employees participate in design contests for museum exhibits and help to build skills by organizing activities in local communities. Employees continue to affirm the value of time spent in these activities, and community engagement has been cited as a factor that contributes to choosing to join Linde for employment. Employees also direct much of the spending from Linde's Global Giving Program. Through matching gifts and employee volunteer grants, the Global Giving Program helps employees benefit charities in their communities. About 11 percent of the Global Giving Program is employee- directed. The matching gifts program also includes countries outside of the U.S. • Drive Driving impact through community engagement is the third main strategic objective. Along with employee-led efforts, Linde's corporate-led community engagement efforts work to confirm its mission and align with business drivers through strategic initiatives, especially in the STEM fields. These programs directly help to increase the number of skilled men and women in the workforce. In addition, both illustrate that the Linde community engagement program and Linde's Global Giving Program work hand-in-hand. The skills gap comprises problems for many stakeholders: - Workers: Lack of preparedness for the underemployed and unemployed - Colleges: Disconnects between training and industry expectations - Industry: Increased cost or project delays due to training or retraining In certain programs, students also earn college credit, allowing students to stack credits transferable to degree programs, in addition to gaining industry-relevant credentials and exposure to potential employment opportunities. The SKILLS PIPELINE program offers a multi-faceted approach to workforce development, including community awareness campaigns, scholarships to provide training for skilled workers, professional development opportunities, support to increase the skills of incumbent workers and instructorships for teachers. In 2020, Linde also saw the graduations from workforce development efforts, including transitioning soldiers in the company’s SKILLS PIPELINE workforce development program in driving. Some of these graduates have found a place in industry post-transition, and some are working for Linde businesses, demonstrating the ability of programs such as those in the SKILLS PIPELINE family to address the skilled-crafts gap that exists in industry. In 2021, the company is considering expansion to other skill areas critical for Linde, and to more geographical locations outside of the U.S.\n",
      "Linde 2020 Sustainable Development Report 85 Linde has supported schools and training centers for welding technology outside of the U.S., especially in regions with low levels of average income, by providing the necessary equipment and expertise. Such programs contribute to improving local living conditions and enhancing equal opportunities. Community Input With a presence in nearly 100 countries, Linde is, at its core, a “local” company. As the company is a member of numerous individual local neighborhoods, communities are one of its relevant stakeholders. For the process for determining Linde stakeholders and engaging those stakeholder groups see the section commencing on page 29. Linde integrates their feedback into its process to determine priority factors, key performance indicators and the company’s SD 2028 targets. Community relations begin with the initial entry into a new area, and the company continues to be part of the neighborhoods where its facilities have a presence and where its team members live and work. Being a good neighbor includes not only understanding community needs to set up or volunteer in suitable community engagement activities but also to communicate crucial information, and to listen to and consider opinions, questions, and concerns. In its Responsible Care Global Policy, the company defines general guiding principles regarding communications with external stakeholders like communities, periodically assess their questions and concerns, implementing suitable communication processes, and measuring performance. The policy also provides for the responsibilities for Business Heads and Operations Heads, accordingly. Linde communicates information about product hazards and safe handling, safety, health and environmental programs and performance, as appropriate. This also includes sharing emergency preparedness plans with community representatives. The effectiveness of the company’s stakeholder communications programs is evaluated regularly. As for all other stakeholders, the company’s standard of responsible behavior towards communities is confirmed by Linde’s Code of Business Integrity. Formal ways to contact Linde can be found on the website, for both email and phone inquiries. Linde employees and teams pay close attention to local needs through activities, such as joining community committees, attending local town meetings, providing public safety awareness, hosting educational community events, and engaging with relevant nonprofit and/or community organizations. Linde hosts community informational events in neighborhoods near operations and builds close relationships with local providers of emergency services. Community events are often a part of workforce development programming as well as engagement between businesses and neighborhoods. In addition, the company's pipeline business has frequent events to educate the community about the business and the importance of safety. As part of the continuing focus on community relations and as part of its SD 2028 goals, Linde has committed to including community needs considerations in 100 percent of its large engineering projects. Activity begins in 2021. The Community Impact Assessment is made by the business and project execution teams during the planning of new and/or significant expansions of Linde sites. It includes a discussion with key stakeholders in the community, which may include representatives from municipalities and community organizations; understanding community needs; and a proposal of potential ways to address these community needs and bring positive impact, especially through social, educational or environmental initiatives. Assessment of Impact: Starting with Need… Ending with Impact Linde assesses the short- and long-term impacts generated by its philanthropic activity. By understanding community needs and how the company can best help address them, impacts are anticipated at the beginning and then measured at appropriate times during projects. The company assesses the impact of its community engagement and Global Giving programs and performs environmental impact assessments. Community Engagement Impact Assessment Impactful projects are the goal of all community engagement efforts. Linde's most recent Sustainable Development Materiality Assessment (SDMA) identified community engagement as a priority for Linde and its stakeholders. Goals and targets are developed and maintained based on the SDMA, managed and reported in the SDMS and published in this report, the 2020 Sustainable Development Report and in the annual Community Engagement Brochure. Linde's strong culture of execution complements its efforts to measure the impact of community engagement. As in prior years, Linde measures and reports the social and environmental impact and outcomes, as well as the employee and company benefits, of community engagement based upon a methodology developed by the United Kingdom-based LBG report, Making a Difference. Before the start of community engagement efforts, project teams focus on desired outcomes from the projects. At the conclusion of each project, the teams measure benefits, as reported by volunteers and/or beneficiaries. Increasingly, third parties help to validate project benefits.\n",
      "86 Linde 2020 Sustainable Development Report • Inputs Inputs are measured by number of hours, number of sites participating and incidence of volunteerism. Results in 2020 reflect the decreased activity in light of the pandemic. See SOC (14). • Outputs Outputs are measured by number of beneficiaries, money raised and goods donated. Linde volunteers brought direct benefits to approximately 350,000 people, including approximately 150,000 students. Results in 2020 reflect the decreased activity in light of the pandemic. See SOC (15). Additionally, projects reported funds that employees and facilities raised or donated in support of community engagement. In addition to funding from the Linde Global Giving Program, employees and facilities raised or donated more than $1.3 million in cash and in-kind donations, including food, clothing, trees/seedlings and other forms of in-kind support. This contribution included approximately $800,000 in cash contributions from employees and facilities. As a part of efforts to continually validate the program, the cash component of this reported contribution was independently verified by an external party for 2020. • Impacts Key impacts are reported as benefits to project recipients, employee volunteers and to the company. Linde has compared the performance of these metrics over time, and continues to see positive impact overall. Trends seen in 2020 are due to the change in the type of volunteerism projects as well as reporting challenges due to the global pandemic. See SOC (16). • Beneficiary Benefits In 88 percent of projects, volunteers reported that community engagement created a positive impact on the attitudes of recipients. In 59 percent of projects, volunteers reported that community engagement provided recipients with job skills or opportunities for personal growth. In 92 percent of projects, volunteers reported that community engagement had a direct impact on the recipients' quality of life. • Employee Benefits In 84 percent of projects, volunteers reported that community engagement helped to increase their own personal growth and effectiveness. In 98 percent of projects, employees reported that volunteering helped increase their interpersonal development. In 80 percent of projects, volunteers reported that community engagement helped to increase their management effectiveness. Further, in 39 percent of projects, employees reported learning and/or developing skills that were transferable to the workplace. Community engagement affects how employees view both Linde and their communities. In 94 percent of projects, volunteers reported that community engagement positively impacted their outlook on Linde and/or their job. In 96 percent of projects, volunteers reported that community engagement gave them a better awareness of the community. • Company Benefits Benefits to Linde are measured in terms of increased engagement with customers and employees and impact on reputation. In 27 percent of projects, volunteers reported that the community engagement projects allowed better engagement with customers. In 90 percent of projects, volunteers reported that community engagement helped to build employee engagement. The impact on reputation is also assessed separately: In approximately 92 percent of projects, volunteers reported that community engagement projects were likely to increase awareness of Linde. In 41 percent of these instances, teams reported that third parties have provided validation of their efforts or the positive impact of their project(s). Longer term, Linde assesses the impact on multiple stakeholders from signature efforts. Considered impacts are both qualitative and quantitative. For example, students who have participated in the company’s SKILLS PIPELINE program have reported high levels of preparation and increased quality of life and self-sufficiency. Linde has seen increased engagement with customers and suppliers, and, ultimately, available skilled talent to meet current demands for workers. It is truly a win-win.\n",
      "Linde 2020 Sustainable Development Report 87 Building Communities… Building Leaders Community engagement programs often give employees opportunities to build leadership and other skills such as project management. Prior voluntary offerings at Linde included trainings where employees could learn more about voluntary board service and the multiple skills offered through such experiences. Several employees have expressed interest or have joined non-profit boards after attending such training, increasing engagement with the community. Community Impact… Business Impact Linde has seen increased engagement with customers and suppliers, and ultimately, available skilled talent to meet current demands for workers. Graduates from the company’s SKILLS PIPELINE program have been hired by Linde, its customers and other members of industry. Graduates leave the program with industry-recognized credentials. The program also introduces skills to diverse populations, including women and veterans. The program has also introduced welding to women, historically underrepresented in the field. Historically, the graduating classes have included a significant number of women graduates: The first graduating class in Louisiana was comprised of approximately 21 percent women. The second class, which graduated in 2017, was comprised of approximately 17 percent women. Global Giving Impact Assessment Since 2014, the company's Global Giving Program has strategically performed impact assessments, also based upon the LBG methodology. Large contributions above a predetermined threshold and long-term contributions are assessed to ensure that outcomes have been achieved. The result of such assessments is annually reviewed by the Global Giving advisory board. Environmental Impact Assessment Community impact is a broad consideration at Linde and extends beyond employee philanthropy. Environmental impact assessments are performed in advance of all Linde capital investments. Plant leadership often participates in town meetings to provide information and answer questions. Ongoing monitoring is provided through Linde's cycle of safety and environmental internal assessments. Linde continues to consider ways to further reach and align with local communities.

      "90 Linde 2020 Sustainable Development Report 413-2 Operations with significant actual and potential negative impacts on local communities Linde is unaware of situations where it has had a negative impact on local communities. The company exercises great care to ensure that its investments in local communities are positive and that local communities perceive the company as a safe place to work and as a good employer. Linde has had no reports of significant potential or actual negative impacts on local communities. Rather, community engagement efforts have demonstrated tangible positive outcomes. See 413-1. Tree planting projects around the globe, such as those conducted by Linde teams in Seoul, not only help to beautify areas but also combat erosion. Linde's pipeline community education events, STEM programs and workforce development programs are examples of the ways that Linde aims to make positive, relevant impact in communities. Programs also provide opportunities to develop skills and increase quality of life. Notably, Linde’s SKILLS PIPELINE workforce development program has introduced many in the community, including women, to welding. Through the workforce development program in commercial truck driving, soldiers exiting from the military gain skills and credentials before they transition to civilian life. Linde conducts community events in many neighborhoods, including those near its pipelines. Linde’s pipeline safety team typically joins industry peers in co-hosting approximately 30 such events each year. These help to introduce communities to the importance of safety and to increase familiarity with the industry, facilities and products. The company’s SKILLS PIPELINE workforce development program is indicative of this collaboration with local communities as well as other members of industry, academia and/or government. These programs are intended to have positive economic impact for communities and for individuals and have been well regarded by legislators, industry groups and academic leadership as offering a creative solution to address a recognized need. These programs build communities by providing resources that potentially impact long-term quality of life. The company’s teams also work with local communities as they enter new geographies. As part of its SD 2028 goals, Linde has a target to include community needs assessments in 100 percent of new, large execution projects, with pilots starting in the Americas. Plant leadership often participates in town meetings to provide information and answer questions, and new projects are often an opportunity to learn about and help address community needs. In a recent execution project at a local customer, Linde’s Bangalore teams discovered a need for improved water sanitation at a local school. Working with construction contractors, the teams improved the water system at the school, which serves more than 100 children. These types of needs assessments and conversations continue to formalize. Additionally, charitable funds, in-kind donations and resources contribute to overall positive impact on local communities. In 2020, these included: • Cash contributions from the Global Giving Program: $9.4 million • In-kind donations raised and donated, including food, clothing, seedlings, product donations and other, but not including cash raised or donated: $1 million (including approximately $500,000 through the Community Engagement program and an additional $500,000 through the Global Giving Program representing product donations such as Linde gases.) • Approximate value of service by Linde volunteers: $485,000 • Approximate value of management support/overheads: $530,000, including fees paid to external organizations for vetting and processing organizations, included in cash contributions above, as well as an approximation of the staff time to manage the Global Giving and Community Engagement programs. (Note: Programs are internally managed; Linde does not charge overhead to these programs.)\n",
      "Linde 2020 Sustainable Development Report 91 414-1 New suppliers that were screened using social rights criteria Suppliers are key to Linde’s ability to meet its customer needs. One hundred percent of new suppliers are screened at the prequalification stage for social issues, including compliance with labor and employment laws, ethics and integrity, safety, human rights, environmental aspects and financial stability. For qualification, suppliers, vendors and contractors must agree to ensure compliance with their contractual commitments and Linde’s CBI and Supplier Code of Conduct, including its Human Rights commitments therein, or demonstrate a comparable commitment to business integrity and human rights via their own policies. The company's supplier agreements routinely include language that require its suppliers to obey international conventions and national and regional statutory requirements in the countries in which they operate, including any applicable national laws regarding human trafficking, forced labor and other forms of modern slavery. It is currently developing standard language for terms and conditions, which will be included, where applicable, in future contracts. The Procurement organization regularly discusses these expectations with suppliers upon qualification contracting and during any audits conducted, including for 100 percent of critical Tier 1 suppliers. The executive management team communicates with the company's top-tier suppliers annually to reinforce its commitment to its policies and to remind suppliers of their obligations in contracting with the company. In particular, the executives reaffirm that the company expects business dealings with suppliers to be based on fairness, honesty, lawfulness, safety, environmental stewardship and social consciousness. It continues to assess the effectiveness of its strategy and, where appropriate, adopt policies and practices that improve its program. 414-2 Negative social impacts in the supply chain and actions taken All suppliers are assessed for social impacts broadly defined, including safety and compliance, which are included within Linde’s basic operational policies and procedures. In the areas that are integral to these operational policies and procedures, such as safety, integrity and compliance, labor standards and anti-discrimination, issues such as non-compliance and remediation are dealt with on an ongoing basis, and no additional action is required. A small number of suppliers were identified outside of these processes, in the area of potential suppliers of materials from conflict zones; see below. Due Diligence Linde’s Human Rights Due Diligence Process is summarized in Table SOC (17). 414-2 This process is informed by the UN Guiding Principles Reporting Framework. For policies and commitments, see 103 (social), 406-1, 207-1, 408-1 and 409-1. A set of human rights risks relating to contractors relate to Linde’s CBI and SHE Policy (safety, non-discrimination, ethics and integrity). As with employees, well-established processes assess and address these contractor risks, and mitigation action, if and where required, is taken. One hundred percent are assessed on a planned schedule through Linde Procurement and through SHEQ internal audits. Process to identify and assess salient human rights risks Linde uses four tools to identify, review and assess potential human rights risks across the company's own operations, its contractor operations and the operations of its JVs, including those over which it has no management control: 1. Internal global Business Risk Assessment process Country management and functional leaders participate in quarterly enterprise-wide global risk assessments. In 2020, human rights as a specific topic was not identified as a top risk, directly or indirectly, nor was it so identified in the last several years. 2. Continuous review of emerging regulatory issues in human rights It is the job of the CCO, together with the businesses and the VP, Sustainability, to stay current with emerging regulations in the area of human rights. In 2020, Linde reported, as required by regulation, to comply with the disclosure requirements of the U.S. SEC Conflict Minerals and the EU CSR Directive/Irish Regulation, which includes a request for information about human rights. The latter was provided in Linde's 2020 Director's Report and Financial Statement.\n",
      "92 Linde 2020 Sustainable Development Report 3. Linde's Compliance Review Board (CRB) The CCO oversees compliance with the CBI and related policies, including human rights. He coordinates activity with business CRBs and with senior management to oversee emerging regulatory issues, review hotline reports and take appropriate action. If these reviews indicate an emerging potential risk, proactive measures are put in place. Linde’s CRB reviews information supplied to the Integrity Hotline monthly at the business level and each quarter at the corporate level (including the CEO, Management Committee, general counsel, CHRO, head of internal audit, controller and CCO). In 2020, there were 573 reports to the Linde hotline, of which none related to potential human rights issues (which would be listed within concerns about \"Other Policy Violations\"). See Linde’s Integrity Hotline Reports at: http://www.linde.com/about-linde/sustainable- development/reporting-center/hotline-reports. No reports were made about potential human rights concerns to the hotline from internal or external parties, and Linde has no knowledge of systematic discrimination by Linde employees against Linde colleagues or third parties (e.g., potential recruits, suppliers, customers) or potentially vulnerable groups (e.g., children, indigenous people, migrant labor or local communities) on the basis of race, color, religion, gender identity or expression, political opinion, national origin, age, disability, veteran status, pregnancy or sexual orientation, and it has no knowledge or reports of unfair compensation or hours of work, lack of access to a safe and sanitary work environment, restrictions on the right to choose or not choose employee organizations, or the use of child, compulsory or forced labor. All of these areas are protected under Linde’s CBI. The CBI prohibits any form of retaliation against any individual for good faith reporting what he/she believes to be non-compliance with this policy to his/her management, to the appropriate staff group or to the confidential Linde Integrity Hotline. Individual cases of misconduct are promptly investigated. Linde does not tolerate verified misconduct: appropriate measures are taken, up to and including dismissal. Reports to the hotline are reviewed locally by the business CRBs and by the corporate CRB. The Linde CRB identifies human rights as a potential issue in its hotline classifications, among \"Other Policy Violations.\" In 2020, Linde reported 40 substantiated incidents of \"Other Policy Violation;\" none was a human rights issue. If any issue was to arise and be substantiated, it would be managed in the company's standard process. Substantiated violations of the CBI are escalated to the Management Committee and subjected to a root cause analysis, and a corrective action plan is implemented. 4. Linde annual review of emerging country-level human rights risk As part of an annual process, the VP, Sustainability, reviews trends in human rights risk on a country basis in countries where Linde operates. Groups that were specifically assessed include Linde employees, suppliers, third-party contracted labor and children/adolescents, women, migrant and minority populations. The VP, Sustainability, reviews material in the media and annual human rights reports issued by the U.S. Department of State (DOS). In 2019, this review was expanded to include all Linde countries. In 2020, it was determined that these reports did not indicate new human rights risks, and no new action was taken. Human Rights Risk — Assessment There is concern that a small portion of suppliers, or their suppliers, including Linde’s Surface Technologies business and the company’s engineering business, could be sourcing materials from \"conflict zones\" where there is a risk of human rights violations. • Conflict Minerals in Electronic Materials: Based on Linde's commitment to governance, compliance and human rights, the most salient human rights issue associated with Linde activities and business relationships is the issue of potential \"conflict minerals\" in its supply chain. Certain minerals (including tin, tantalum, tungsten and gold) have been linked with funding killings, violence, rape and other human rights abuses in the Democratic Republic of Congo and other conflict zones. These affect all citizens in these regions, particularly women, children and adolescents. A subset of Linde suppliers — approximately 1,000 suppliers— present a risk of sourcing minerals from conflict zones. To mitigate potential human rights violations in the \"conflict minerals\" supply chain, Linde’s due diligence process conforms, in all material respects, with the framework set forth in the OECD Due Diligence Guidance for Responsible Supply Chains of Minerals from Conflict-Affected and High-Risk Areas (OECD Guidance) and the related supplements for gold, tin, tantalum and tungsten. Linde has adopted a Conflict Materials Supply Policy. This policy is available on Linde’s website at https://www.linde.com/-/media/linde/merger/documents/global-procurement/linde-conflict-free-materials-supply- policy.pdf?la=en. Linde’s due diligence process includes monitoring the performance and continual improvement of its suppliers, and, where relevant, with their suppliers, and reporting to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), on Linde’s website at: https://irpages2.eqs.com/websites/lindeplc/English/3210/us-sec- filing.html?shortDesc=Specialized%20Disclosure%20Report&format=html&secFilingId=0280c70a-1e34-4570-9e24-da630514358e.\n",
      "Linde 2020 Sustainable Development Report 93 Linde continues to work with these suppliers to ensure conformance with its policy and standards and with applicable law. • Slavery in Supply Chain: Linde has policies in conformance with country regulation. For example, in the UK, Linde has published a policy in conformance with The U.K. Modern Anti-Slavery Act of 2015 that reiterates its \"opposition to the use of all forms of child, compulsory or forced labor at our operations and establishes the expectation that our business partners, suppliers and contractors will demonstrate similar intolerance for such practices.\" • Sex Trafficking on Truck Driving Routes: Linde works with major NGOs active in this area to train its network of employee and contractor truck drivers to help mitigate this crime. Voluntary action is ongoing in Brazil, the U.S. and Canada, and in 2019, was extended to Mexico. Monitoring, Communication and Training Regular reviews are conducted across all regions to confirm that processes are set up to ensure compliance with corporate policies, including human rights, compliance, safety and employment, and labor standards. Many of these themes fall under regular Linde management and are managed through those functions. See 404-1 for a description of training and other programs to reinforce compliance, safety and fair labor practices. Human Rights Grievances To Linde's knowledge, in 2020, there were no grievances related to human rights filed through formal organizational grievance mechanisms by individuals or groups, internal or external to the organization and none through the integrity hotline.\n",

      "Linde 2020 Sustainable Development Report 95 415-1 Total value of political contributions by country and recipient/beneficiary Linde does not make any political contributions as a company, neither to political parties nor candidates. In the U.S., employees have formed a political action committee (PAC). Under the umbrella of this independent registered committee, employees collect donations to politicians, political parties and associations and make their own decisions as to how the funds will be used. The PAC Executive Committee has broad employee representation and approves all political contributions made on behalf of the PAC. The Linde PAC is governed by a series of internal policies and adheres to a strict set of by-laws. Following the merger, the PAC for Linde GmbH (previously Linde AG) North America was terminated in 2019, and all activities were conducted through the Praxair PAC, which is now the Linde PAC. In 2020 to the beginning of 2021, total PAC contributions totaled $19,000 to local, state and federal candidates for elected office representing both political parties. (Scope: United States, not including Lincare, which has a separate PAC with contributions less than the Linde PAC.) Linde’s contributions include: contributions to political campaigns (from the PAC); contributions to trade associations, tax-exempt organizations and lobbying firms. In 2020, the total contribution was approximately $3.8 million, of which more than half was for trade associations and tax-exempt organizations; this amount includes the policy-related portion of membership dues. Increases from 2019 to 2020 reflect improved data tracking of trade association dues and not a significant increase in spending. See SOC (18) and SOC (19). There was no spending on ballot measures or referendums. Political contributions receipts and disbursements are reported in detail and disclosed publicly. This detail can be found on the U.S. Federal Elections Commission website at: https://www.fec.gov/data/committee/C00283440/?cycle=2020. Political contributions overview, more information on political activities, and a link to the U.S. Federal Elections Commission website for detailed reporting of data is provided at: https://www.lindeus.com/our-company/corporate-responsibility/government-affairs. Public Advocacy Issues The two largest public policy advocacy issues for 2020 were medical oxygen access in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and the promotion of hydrogen as a substitute for fossil fuels. Priority: Medical oxygen access in response to COVID-19 Healthcare system and patient access to medical oxygen is a key priority, and healthcare represents a significant portion of Linde’s business, approximately 20 percent of revenue in 2020. Linde’s products contribute positively to the health and wellbeing of our customers. Homecare and hospital patients worldwide benefit from our medical gases, devices, services and therapies, especially in respiratory care. For example, during the COVID-19 pandemic, Linde medical oxygen was crucial to healthcare responders and their patients in many of our countries. For example, in the U.S., Lincare is a leading provider of home respiratory- therapy products and services and has served approximately 40,000 patients during the pandemic. As COVID-19 overwhelmed healthcare facilities around the world, our local teams took extraordinary measures to deliver essential medical oxygen under challenging conditions, and the company’s efforts to provide supply have been recognized by external parties. Priority: Hydrogen as a Substitute for Fossil Fuels Global progress and adoption of hydrogen and other alternatives to fossil fuels is key to global reduction of GHGs and Linde’s commitment to its own climate change targets. Linde is a global leader in the production, processing, storage and distribution of hydrogen. It has the largest liquid hydrogen capacity and distribution system in the world. The company also operates the world's first high-purity hydrogen storage cavern, coupled with a pipeline network of approximately 1,000 kilometers to reliably supply its customers. Linde is at the forefront in the transition to clean hydrogen and has installed nearly 200 hydrogen fueling stations and 80 hydrogen electrolysis plants worldwide and includes decarbonization investments within its SD 2028 targets. Decarbonization is a priority for Linde, with the goal of investing more than $1 billion investment in decarbonization technologies in large capital projects, where the primary aim of Linde and/or its customers is to reduce GHG emissions or advance the use of low-carbon fuels and energy. See the Performance Against Targets chapter for more details.\n",

      "OUR APPROACH ENVIRONMENT SOCIAL GOVERNANCE APPENDIX ABOUT 3 ECOLAB CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 2021 | ACCELERATING OUR GROWTH AND GLOBAL IMPACT WE ARE LIVING IN HISTORIC TIMES. If the experience of the last two years has taught us anything, it is how interconnected and resilient we are as a people. As the world confronts the shared challenges of climate change, water scarcity and a global pandemic, Ecolab’s purpose – protecting people and the resources vital to life – has never been more important. We have always seen opportunities where others see challenges. Just as climate change is among the greatest challenges of our time, finding the path to net-zero emissions is the corresponding growth opportunity. In 2021, we again proved that delivering both strong financial and sustainability performance is possible. By focusing on the business success of our customers, Ecolab grew 7% organically and delivered 17% EPS growth, consistent with the company's long-term ambition to grow sales 6-8% and EPS 15%. Our performance as a business is core to our ability to deliver on our purpose – as Ecolab continues to grow, so does our positive impact on the world. Once again, internally we delivered on progress towards our ambitious 2030 goals by accelerating initiatives within our own operations and nurturing our talent. We advanced our efforts to achieve a positive water impact and halve our carbon emissions by 2030. All our European and North American facilities are set to source 100% renewable electricity, and we are on track to source 100% renewable electricity globally by 2030. We also made more progress toward our representation goals for women and people of color in 2021 than in the previous four years combined. We are proud to say that last year, 38% of all new management-level hires globally were women and 35% of all new management-level hires in the U.S. were people of color. And we achieved a 96% increase in year-over- year spend with diverse suppliers. Beyond the progress toward our 2030 goals, we exponentially increased our impact through the work we do with our customers. In 2021, the Ecolab team continued to deliver for our customers, providing unmatched expertise and industry-leading programs, like Ecolab Science CertifiedTM, which has been designed to advance cleaner, safer practices, and which continues to expand. It has been adopted by some of the major global brands in the industry, and by thousands of restaurants, hotels, event spaces and retail locations, to help protect staff and customers from COVID-19. At the same time, the Ecolab team delivered on its long-term promise to help customers produce better outcomes, while improving their total operating costs by reducing their usage of natural resources and their impact on the environment and by meeting their sustainability and net-zero goals. In 2021, in partnership with our customers, we helped: Two billion people around the world are currently living in water-stressed areas, and the same will be true of more than half the world’s population by 2050 if no action is taken. Because 150 companies can directly impact approximately one-third of the world’s water use, we believe that industry has a unique responsibility and opportunity to address the global water crisis. Ecolab therefore continues to exponentially grow its positive impact through initiatives like the Water Resilience Coalition, an industry-driven initiative of the UN Global Compact’s CEO Water Mandate, which Ecolab co-founded. At Ecolab, we see an unparalleled opportunity to grow both our business and positive impact in the world, and to help our customers do the same. We are proud of our progress and what is still to come. Together, with our customers, we will keep growing and delivering on our purpose to make the world a cleaner, safer and healthier place by protecting people and the resources vital to life. Sincerely, Christophe Beck President and Chief Executive Officer • Conserve 215 billion gallons of water, or enough to meet the drinking water needs of 734 million people (well ahead of required progress to help save enough drinking water for 1 billion people by 2030), • Provide safe food to 1.4 billion people. We are on- track to provide safe food to 2 billion people by 2030, • Clean 60 billion hands, which is ahead of our 2030 target, and • Avoid 3.6 million metric tons of greenhouse gas emissions (also ahead of our target).\n",
      "OUR APPROACH ENVIRONMENT SOCIAL GOVERNANCE APPENDIX ABOUT 4 ECOLAB CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 2021 | ADVANCING A SUSTAINABLE FUTURE TOGETHER WITH OUR CUSTOMERS IN 2021, DESPITE THE MANY CHALLENGES FACING US, ECOLAB MADE TREMENDOUS PROGRESS TOWARD OUR AMBITIOUS 2030 CUSTOMER IMPACT GOALS. We helped our customers save 215 billion gallons of water, provide safe food to 1.4 billion people, clean 60 billion hands and avoid 3.6 million metric tons of greenhouse gas emissions. We have also made great progress in our efforts to achieve a net positive water impact, tackle carbon emissions, support a diverse and inclusive workforce and prioritize safety everywhere we work. A few highlights from 2021 include: • Receiving Alliance for Water Stewardship (AWS) certification for two additional manufacturing sites in Mexico and receiving our first-ever platinum certification for our facility in Taicang, China • Signing a virtual power purchase agreement in Finland that will enable us to achieve 100% renewable electricity by 2030 • Launching an employee-led Global Sustainability Network to accelerate Ecolab’s growth and impact It’s not easy for a company to achieve sustainability goals while simultaneously growing its business and creating value for stakeholders, but it can be done. • An unwavering commitment from leadership • Alignment with our business strategy • Readiness of our organization to act At Ecolab, we’ve learned that having our CEO and executive leadership committed to supporting us on this journey is critical. And what helps get them on board is understanding the implications to our business strategy in terms of risks and opportunities. If we don’t address the challenges posed by water scarcity and climate change, we can’t continue to succeed and grow. Last, it’s essential to get the organization ready by establishing a 10-year path with science-based targets, defined annual milestones and leading indicators so leaders and managers can get the work done. We are proud of what we accomplished in 2021, but we’re even more excited about our future. The next decade will be critical as we deal with challenges related to the climate and water crisis. Together, with our customers, we will continue to make a meaningful difference as we work toward our common goals. Sincerely, Emilio Tenuta Senior Vice President and Chief Sustainability Officer I am confident that we can continue on our glide path toward achieving our goals because of three key factors:\n",

      "OUR APPROACH ENVIRONMENT SOCIAL GOVERNANCE APPENDIX ABOUT 7 ECOLAB CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 2021 | Throughout the second year of the COVID-19 pandemic, we continued to help protect our customers through our products and expertise. Through Ecolab proprietary research conducted in 2021, we found that over 95% of consumers want to see as much or more cleaning and sanitation practices even after the COVID-19 vaccine had been distributed. Ecolab Science CertifiedTM, designed to advance cleaner, safer practices, helps to deliver confidence as consumers get back to the moments and the places they have been missing.

      "OUR APPROACH ENVIRONMENT SOCIAL GOVERNANCE APPENDIX ABOUT 9 ECOLAB CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 2021 | ESG GOVERNANCE While the full Board of Directors monitors the company’s progress on environmental, social and governance (ESG) outcomes, the Safety, Health and Environment (SHE) Committee has the highest level of direct responsibility for sustainability policies, programs and practices that affect, or could affect, Ecolab employees, customers, stockholders and neighboring communities. The SHE Committee materials are available to the Board, and the SHE Committee reports to the Board on the company’s progress against its sustainability goals and implementation of projects and related activities. The SHE Committee is also responsible for assuring the company's compliance with applicable safety, health and environmental laws and regulations and monitoring such compliance. See our SHE Committee Charter for additional information. Ecolab’s sustainability strategy includes environmental, social and governance components and is governed by a Sustainability Executive Advisory Team (SEAT) that is made up of around 10 members of the company’s executive leadership team including our Senior Vice President and Chief Sustainability Officer. The SEAT meets with the Corporate Sustainability team on a quarterly basis. Outputs of these meetings are reported by the Senior Vice President and Chief Sustainability Officer to the SHE Committee of the Board. The Corporate Sustainability team is comprised of research and development, communications, marketing and supply chain functions and is responsible for operationalizing sustainable business practices and polices across the company, coordinating and communicating policy and decision-making related to sustainability, setting goals and metrics for key sustainability priorities and assessing sustainability outlook and risk management. INCENTIVES Ecolab is unique in that its value proposition for customers has, for nearly a century, been to fundamentally improve their sustainability. Our products are designed to provide not only the best performance for our broad range of customers, but to do so in a manner using less of the customers’ resources. Through our work, we have a major impact on customers’ water and energy use, and thereby can leverage the environmental work we perform in our own operations. Strategic ESG and sustainability indicators are included in our measures of performance used to determine compensation for senior leaders and employees. To promote sustained company success, all leaders work together to deliver against corporate ESG goals. ESG indicators, including our 2030 Impact Goals, are a part of how we measure performance, which is used to determine short-term cash compensation for executives. Our cash bonus plans include an Individual Business Objective which is a component within the overall bonus plan design. Bonus payout for Individual Bonus Objectives within the bonus plan are adjusted up or down in alignment with performance against and achievement of stated goals. Performance against these objectives is also used to differentiate other executive compensation components such as annual merit. Management employees with direct involvement in the company’s ESG and sustainability work, including our 2030 Impact Goals, have water, climate and/or diversity, equity and inclusion targets built into their compensation plans. We use different performance measures in our short- and long-term incentive plans, and these measures directly reflect the significant positive impact our products and services can have on reducing our customers’ water and energy usage. Since our value proposition is to provide customers the best results while consistently lowering their environmental impacts, improving sustainability is an inherent driver of our financial success, which translates directly into our adjusted EPS goal in our annual incentive plan and adjusted ROIC goal in our equity program.\n",

Our annual stakeholder-engagement process includes employees, investors, customers, suppliers and relevant external groups, such as non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and communities. Employees Our associates drive innovation, support business growth and provide personally delivered service and on-the-ground support at nearly three million customer locations. The perspectives of our associates are critical to our success and inform our business strategy. In 2019, we surveyed more than 5,000 associates and held in-person interviews to inform our sustainability strategy and focus areas for subsequent years. In addition, our annual Assessment of Significant Business Risks and biannual sustainability materiality assessment processes include interviews and surveys of leadership across business units and functions, including business leads, Human Resources, Supply Chain, Research, Development and Engineering, Finance, Risk, Legal and Regulatory Affairs and Field Sales. Sustainability is core to Ecolab’s culture. Every day, our 47,000 associates look for ways to solve our world’s greatest water, food, health and climate challenges with our customers and in our own operations. So, when associates around the world began imagining ways to help Ecolab amplify its positive impact on the planet, they knew harnessing their shared passion could have a big effect. That’s why Ecolab’s associates launched the Global Sustainability Network (GSN), a new employee-led community group that will work to accelerate Ecolab’s growth and impact through education, communication and collaboration on environmental sustainability issues. The group will embody the idea that in order to create a healthier, more sustainable world, we’ll need to work together more closely than ever before. We have made tremendous progress toward our 2030 Impact Goals, but we have now reached a point in our evolution as a trusted sustainability leader, that the work we have in front of us over the next decade can no longer fall on the shoulders of the vital few. We are expanding opportunities to drive change to all associates to help us on the journey we are on. Being able to engage Ecolab associates, build awareness and provide education on the latest sustainability trends demonstrate how each and every employee can have a direct impact on sustainability through their work. The Global Sustainability Network welcomes Ecolab associates across the world and had over 550 founding members upon its launch on Earth Day 2022. With more than 25,000 sales-and-service associates servicing nearly three million customer locations in 170 countries across the global, Ecolab associates are helping make the world cleaner, safer and healthier, protecting people and vital resources. The new Global Sustainability Network will continue that momentum, helping Ecolab in its aim to deliver a more sustainable future for everyone.

These comprehensive reviews are conducted using a survey tool designed to identify strategic, operational, financial and compliance- related risks to the company. Risks are documented along with the likelihood and impact of their occurrence. An audit-services vice president manages the process, and the results are presented to the Executive Management team and Ecolab’s Board of Directors. The most significant business risks are reported publicly through the company’s annual 10-K. Ecolab’s CEO is responsible for appropriate strategy adjustments. A biannual sustainability materiality assessment informs our corporate sustainability strategy and reporting activities. This process involves a detailed review of industry trends and best practices, peer benchmarking and internal and external stakeholder engagement with employees, investors, customers, community groups and non-governmental organizations. It also leverages the results of our enterprise Assessment of Significant Business Risks to align the materiality of sustainability topics with key business drivers. Topics are ranked and prioritized according to significance of impact and importance to stakeholders to ensure we focus on the most strategic issues and maintain Ecolab’s sustainability leadership in the marketplace. Outputs of this assessment are integrated into the annual Assessment of Significant Business Risks to ensure critical sustainability risks and opportunities are further evaluated and linked to our core business strategy. Results Guided by the Global Reporting Initiative’s (GRI) Reporting Principles, we conducted a sustainability materiality refresh in 2019 that built upon previous assessments conducted in 2017 and 2015. We used GRI’s definition of material topics to identify relevant and material topics to include in the analysis. Through this process, we identified priority material topics that are important to stakeholders and significant to our business. These results were reviewed by our CEO and Sustainability Executive Advisory Team (SEAT) and further evaluated against the same set of criteria used in our Enterprise Risk Management process and annual Assessment of Significant Business Risks to identify the topics most critical for the global business that align with our core values, goals and competencies. This final analysis informed creation of our 2030 Impact Goals and the continued integration of sustainability into our corporate strategy, business operations, culture and communications.

      "OUR APPROACH ENVIRONMENT SOCIAL GOVERNANCE APPENDIX ABOUT 17 According to the United Nations1, by 2050, the world will need 60% more food than what is produced today. At the same time, consumers’ tastes are changing. They are seeking more local, fresh and organic foods, and want increased transparency around the food supply chain and food safety. The food value chain is one of the last major industries to completely modernize, but the latest technologies are having a major positive impact throughout the food system. With our food safety expertise and knowledge of the food industry, we are in a unique position to guide entrepreneurs and start-ups that are creating these new technologies. And while Ecolab provides innovative food safety solutions and programs from the farm and processing facilities to restaurants and retail every day, we recognize that helping bring critical solutions to scale can help us solve the challenges of safely feeding the world’s growing population. That is why we teamed up with Cargill and the Techstars Farm to Fork Accelerator, a mentorship- driven program that engages early-stage entrepreneurs focused on the future of food and agriculture. Now in its fourth year, the Techstars Farm to Fork Accelerator identifies and fosters entrepreneurs seeking to effect positive change across the food system through the improvement of food safety and quality, food-related digital technology, the use of upcycled materials and the harnessing of research data for the betterment of the industry.

      "OUR APPROACH ENVIRONMENT SOCIAL GOVERNANCE APPENDIX ABOUT ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT Approach Alongside our sustainable impact with customers, we are committed to making a difference in our own operations. Our sustainability leadership has long been rooted in our enterprise-wide commitment to operational efficiency and environmental stewardship. Ecolab’s Global Safety Health & Environmental Position and Sustainability Position formalize our commitment to excellence in global safety, health and environmental (SHE) practices and performance. These commitments extend past our own operations to our suppliers and contractors and are foundational to our work with our customers. Our Board of Directors’ SHE Committee has oversight responsibility for Ecolab’s SHE programs and the SHE Position is executed through our internal SHE management system, which is implemented at all global facilities. In addition to meeting the Ecolab SHE Management System requirements, 57% of our plants have achieved International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 14001 – Environmental Management Systems certification. Moreover, 30% of our sites are Occupational Health and Safety Assessment Series (OHSAS) 18001 or ISO 45001 certified and 72% of our manufacturing sites have external certification to ISO 9001 standards. Governance While the full Board of Directors monitors Ecolab’s progress on sustainability, the Safety, Health and Environment (SHE) Committee of the Board has the highest level of responsibility for all sustainability matters, including climate- and water-related issues. This Committee's materials are available to the Board, and this Committee reports to the Board at least annually on the company’s implementation of and progress against its goals. Our Senior Vice President and Chief Sustainability Officer leads Ecolab’s Corporate Sustainability program and monitors risks, opportunities and performance related to climate change and water. Performance Our environmental performance achievements are the result of enterprise- and facility-level commitments to increase the efficiency of our operations through actions and investments that result in greater environmental stewardship. Through our Create and Maintain Value program, we employ our expertise and technology to continually find more ways to deliver strong business results while saving water, energy and wastewater and prolonging equipment life throughout our facilities. We do this with an eye for how our impact extends beyond our operations to local people and communities. Third-Party Inventories Verification Our global Scope 1, 2 and 3 (business travel only) GHG emissions are verified by a third party, APEX Companies LLC, using the ISO 14064-3: Greenhouse Gases - Part 3 specification standard. Additionally, we verify our global water withdrawal, water replenishment projects, NOx and SOx emissions, volatile organic compounds emissions, hazardous air pollutants emissions and hazardous waste volume through APEX Companies LLC using the International Standard on Assurance Engagements (ISAE) 3000 Revised. CLEAN REVENUE Ecolab defines “clean revenue” as revenue from product and service offerings that deliver a clear and significant social or environmental benefit. While there is currently no generally accepted standard for quantifying clean revenue, we have sought to align with reputable external standards where possible. For 2021, our clean revenue total includes: 1. Revenue from water-saving technologies within our Global Industrial and Global Institutional divisions. Our water-saving technologies deliver meaningful improvements in use-phase resource efficiency as defined by the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) Chemicals Standard. 2. Revenue from wastewater treatment technologies within our Global Industrial division. Our wastewater treatment technologies protect watersheds and enable our customers to meet the most stringent water quality requirements. 3. Products certified by third parties such as Green Seal, Nordic Swan, EU Ecolabel and EPA Safer Choice, which deliver clear environmental and/or social benefits relative to the typical market product. Using these criteria, we have determined that 64% of our 2021 revenue can be considered clean. We believe this is a conservative estimate. As we continue to improve our clean revenue methodology and data collection systems to capture the full breadth of environmental and social value that our products and services deliver across our key impact areas of water, climate, food and health, we expect our clean revenue figure to increase in future years. In 2021, we invested over $1.2 million in continuous improvement projects focused on water and energy reductions at over 20 of our facilities across the globe. In all, these projects reduced total energy consumption by almost 5.4 billion BTUs, reduced GHG emissions by 324 MT CO2e and saved 27 million gallons (~103,000 cubic meters) of water across our global footprint. 23 ECOLAB CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 2021 |\n",

      "OUR APPROACH ENVIRONMENT SOCIAL GOVERNANCE APPENDIX ABOUT CLIMATE Making Measurable Progress To meet our ambitious goals, we utilize a combination of tactics in line with science-based strategies. This means: • Increasing energy efficiency to reduce emissions within our manufacturing and business operations • Utilizing renewable electricity sources • Electrifying our fleet of service vehicles • Partnering with suppliers to reduce their emissions • Evolving our Scope 3 accounting tools and methodology to shift away from an economic-based allocation method • Continuing to develop innovative programs that reduce water and energy use for our customers • Uniting with external partners on nature-based solutions to combat climate change and water scarcity. The combination of these efforts has put us ahead of pace as we do our part to limit global warming to 1.5˚C above pre-industrial levels. We do not currently purchase carbon offsets nor have short-term plans to do so. Increasing Energy Efficiency Ecolab is actively expanding energy efficiency projects at Ecolab sites across the globe and identifying net- zero pilot facilities in strategic markets. In 2021, we focused on continuous progress within our operations, completing process improvement projects that reduced total energy consumption by almost 5.4 billion BTUs and GHG emissions by 324 MT CO2e. Several of our manufacturing sites have captured significant energy reductions through targeted projects. For example, our plant in Garyville, Louisiana installed an automated condensate return system which resulted in substantial energy savings of 3.8 billion BTUs. Boiler automation systems at our facilities in Shika, Japan and Lerma, Mexico saved over 430 million BTUs combined and several other facilities have reduced energy use through more efficient seasonal processes and procedures. In 2021, we made progress toward our 2030 goals by reducing absolute Scope 1 and 2 carbon emissions by 28% from a 2018 base year. To maintain our momentum, we are completing decarbonization audits at large US-based manufacturing sites and creating an energy optimization playbook for global manufacturing sites.

      "OUR APPROACH ENVIRONMENT SOCIAL GOVERNANCE APPENDIX ABOUT CLIMATE Strategy and Risk Management Climate-related issues are monitored by the CEO and Senior Vice President and Chief Sustainability Officer through our annual enterprise risk assessment, biannual sustainability materiality assessment, ethical and environmental standards survey of performance in the global supply chain and quarterly management meetings with the Sustainability Executive Advisory Team (SEAT) and the Corporate Sustainability team. Climate-related risks are assessed within our Enterprise Risk Management process and annual Business Significance Risks Assessment, which is aligned with recommendations of the Financial Stability Board (FSB) Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD). Various laws and regulations pertaining to climate change have been implemented, or are being considered for implementation, at the international, national, regional and state levels, particularly as they relate to the production of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. None of these laws and regulations directly apply to Ecolab at the present time, however, as a matter of corporate policy, we support a balanced approach to reducing GHG emissions while sustaining economic growth. Climate-Related Disclosures To demonstrate Ecolab’s resilience in the face of climate change to stakeholders, Ecolab has continued its climate-related risk and opportunity assessment in 2021 in alignment with best practices of the TCFD. Ecolab recognizes that climate change poses potential risks and creates potential opportunities to our organization. To address this, Ecolab has taken steps to further identify and assess the nature and magnitude of these risks and opportunities. The results of the analysis are currently being reviewed so that adaptation and mitigation plans can be developed for relevant climate change risks and to further benefit from identified opportunities. The threats and opportunities associated with climate change are dynamic in nature. It is a long- term and uncertain phenomenon which requires a response that considers how future risks and opportunities interact with business timescales as they evolve. To best respond to climate risks and opportunities, Ecolab is including climate-related matters across governance, strategy and risk management processes. This work includes defining climate-related key performance indicators and improving data collection and management to better inform scenario analyses and understand the true scale of the potential financial impacts from climate change on Ecolab. We have taken steps to further identify and assess the nature and magnitude of these risks and opportunities. Ecolab has been focused on assessing climate risks for the past three years, leading up to our TCFD-aligned climate risk assessment conducted in 2021. We will continue our efforts to assess additional climate-related risks and opportunities, including exploring our supply chain resiliency. We will also review the results of our 2021 analysis and develop adaptation and management plans for any relevant climate change risks and to further benefit from identified opportunities for customer impact.

For Ecolab, that means continuing to drive corporate water management with our customers, while also identifying opportunities to implement water stewardship projects in our own operations. Our sights are set toward our 2030 Impact Goal to further expand our positive water impact in our own operations to: • Reduce water impact by 40% per unit production across our enterprise from a 2018 base year • Restore greater than 50% of our absolute water withdrawal volume at high-risk sites • Achieve Alliance for Water Stewardship (AWS) Standard certification in high-risk watersheds Making Measurable Progress As part of these commitments, Ecolab has prioritized water stewardship projects at our sites with an aim to improve the overall health of the local watersheds. Our projects use a three-pathway strategy to achieve a net-positive water impact by: 1. Increasing water-use efficiency, reuse and recycling using Ecolab solutions and digital technologies 2. Protecting local watersheds 3. Delivering outcomes through AWS certification Increasing Water-Use Efficiency, Reuse and Recycling Managing 1 trillion gallons of water annually, Ecolab’s team of experts is skilled in helping customers identify and implement water reduction, reuse and recycle solutions that support watersheds in the locations where we operate. We utilize this same expertise within our own operations to optimize water use. Through Ecolab solutions like 3D TRASAR™, Water Flow Intelligence and digital tools like the Smart Water Navigator, we support smart water management practices to reduce demand and improve water quality while optimizing costs at the facility and organizational level. In 2021, we delivered on projects resulting in approximately 27 million gallons (~103,000 cubic meters) of water savings. One example of this work is the design of a new wastewater treatment station at our production facility in Châlons-en-Champagne, France. The new wastewater treatment station uses water reuse technology supported by Nalco Water, Ecolab’s water and process management business, to reduce water discharge to the city sewer network by almost 80%. The treatment system may allow the facility to reuse up to 20 million gallons (~78,000 cubic meters) of water each year. Additionally in 2021, smart water valves were installed at key manufacturing sites, with additional valves to be installed at several other locations in 2022. These valves help increase accuracy of water meter readings, resulting in water savings. In 2021, these initiatives saved over 5.2 million gallons (~20,000 cubic meters) of water at the facilities that installed them. Numerous production sites implemented reverse osmosis water reuse projects in 2021, resulting in over 1.3 million gallons (~5,000 cubic meters) of annual water savings. In support of water efficiency actions across our global supply chain, a horizontal process network shares expertise and best practices across sites. This included the introduction of a water management tool in 2021 to guide facility teams on water reduction, reuse and recycling methods. Because of these actions and others, in 2021, we reduced overall water impact intensity (cubic meters / MT of product produced) by 25% from a 2018 base year.

      "OUR APPROACH ENVIRONMENT SOCIAL GOVERNANCE APPENDIX ABOUT With urgent action, the world’s water crises can be alleviated. But corporations must take action to reduce the amount of water they consume in their operations. Identifying inefficiencies in water usage and making changes to help optimize operations leads to real progress on water-related sustainability goals – from the enterprise level to individual facilities. And while reducing water use is an important step, it’s not the only one. It is critical that businesses reach outside their facilities to work with those who share the same water resources and strive to ensure water availability, quality and access for all. We’re working to bring this work to life through our co-founding membership in the Water Resilience Coalition, an initiative of the UN Global Compact’s CEO Water Mandate. The Water Resilience Coalition, founded in 2020, is an industry-driven, CEO-led coalition that aims to elevate global water stress to the top of the corporate agenda and preserve the world’s freshwater resources through collective action in water-stressed basins and ambitious, quantifiable commitments. What that means for Ecolab is that, in addition to working to help our customers enable proactive water management in their operations, we’re making progress on the goals we’ve set for our own facilities as well. We’ve approached these goals through key partnerships with other companies in the Water Resilience Coalition and with public organizations like the California Water Action Collaborative (CWAC), a network for diverse stakeholders pursuing collective action projects that will improve California’s water security for people, business, agriculture and nature. We’ve also contributed to Water.org to enable access to sustainable drinking water and improved sanitation for 100,000 people living in poverty in India, while contributing more than 26.4 million gallons (100,000 cubic meters) of water per year to watershed health in extremely high-stress river basins in which Ecolab operates, including Chennai, Mumbai, Konnagar, Delhi, Baroda, Jamshedpur, Kolkata and Pune.

      "OUR APPROACH ENVIRONMENT SOCIAL GOVERNANCE APPENDIX ABOUT WATER Strategy and Risk Management Our annual water risk assessment assesses 100% of our operations and is used to identify facilities that may operate within water-stressed regions and determine whether we have substantive water- related risks. To date, we have not identified any inherent water-related risks with the potential to have a substantive financial or strategic impact on our business. For more information, please see our 2021 CDP Water Security Report. Water Risk Assessment Ecolab conducts an annual water risk assessment to identify facilities that may operate within water stressed regions, both in the near- and long- term. The analysis is based on combining our operational water withdrawal, effluent footprint and production metrics with water risk inputs and financial cost valuations from the Smart Water Navigator to inform decisions at an operational level. The Smart Water Navigator leverages leading, publicly available quantitative water risk datasets developed by the World Resources Institute and World Wildlife Fund. Methodology Detail In 2021, our water risk assessment scope included 100% of our direct operations. We assessed all company locations (including plants, offices, distribution, warehouses, flex/R&D and related facilities), representing 100% of our global withdrawal and effluent footprint. This list of facilities was assessed using a variety of risk criteria inputs provided by the World Resources Institute (WRI) Aqueduct Water Risk Atlas and insights available through the Ecolab Smart Water Navigator. Results Using GRI’s definition of water stress, 17.7% of Ecolab’s total water withdrawal is sourced from areas with “high” or “extremely high” current baseline water stress, as assessed using the WRI Aqueduct Water Risk Atlas. To further evaluate our water risk, we also assessed sites in these areas against the following risk criteria: • Future baseline water stress is expected to remain the same or increase (based on RCP 8.5 climate scenario to 2030 in WRI’s Aqueduct Water Risk Atlas) • Ten-year potential Revenue at Risk is greater than 10% (based on the Smart Water Navigator tool)1 • Production intensity (i.e., the percentage of each sites’ production out of total production) is greater than 1% Based on these criteria, only two sites representing 4.8% of total production volume and 1.9% of total water withdrawal have been identified as operating in river basins where production may be affected by water risk. Both sites are working hard to mitigate this risk and are in scope of our 2030 Impact Goal to restore greater than 50% of water withdrawal and obtain AWS certification within high-risk watersheds. One of the sites, our City of Industry plant in California, obtained AWS certification in 2017. Furthermore, in 2021 we invested in a water replenishment project within City of Industry’s watershed, the Colorado River Indian Tribes Systems Conservation Project through partnership with the Bonneville Environmental Foundation, which compensates the Colorado River Indian Tribes for conserving Colorado River water and directly shoring up declining water levels in Lake Mead. Ecolab’s investment delivers a volumetric benefit of 19.2 million gallons (~73,000 cubic meters) per year over a 10-year period. 1 Revenue at risk compares the estimated amount of water a business requires to generate revenue (cubic meters per USD of revenue) to the business’ share of water available in the water basin if water was allocated among water users based on economic activity (contribution to basin-level GDP). 40 ECOLAB CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 2021 |\n",
      "OUR APPROACH ENVIRONMENT SOCIAL GOVERNANCE APPENDIX ABOUT BIODIVERSITY AND ADAPTATION Approach Ecolab’s sustainability efforts support protecting biodiversity by preserving quantity and quality of water in watersheds in which we and our customers operate and mitigating the impacts of climate change as critical factors in preserving endangered species. Our Biodiversity Position recognizes the importance of conserving biodiversity in support of our mission and formalizes our commitment. Impact on Biodiversity and Habitats Ecolab’s direct operations, activities, products and/ or services do not have a significant impact on biodiversity in protected areas or areas of high biodiversity value outside of protected areas. We are not aware of any operations that affect International Union for Conservation of Nature’s (IUCN) red-list species or national conservation list species. Of the sites evaluated, representing 80% of our manufacturing facilities, there are no locations within Key Biodiversity Areas (KBAs). 22 sites are within a 10- mile radius of a KBA and eight of those are considered as part of our set of priority sites for water projects and have been, or will be going to work toward, Alliance for Water Stewardship (AWS) certification. Habitats Protected or Restored Ecolab continues to support its partnership with The Nature Conservancy (TNC) securing and restoring environments and water sources around the globe. We are a sponsor of TNC’s Urban Water Blueprint which analyzes the state of water in more than 2,000 watersheds and 530 cities worldwide to provide science-based recommendations to improve water quality. The following are region-specific examples of the impacts we help with through our partnership with TNC. Minnesota Headwaters Fund | United States Ecolab was an initial funder of the work with TNC’s Minnesota Headwaters Fund, which began in 2014, to support high-impact conservation projects to protect clean water in Minnesota’s lake and rivers which has a ten-year goal to protect 100,000 acres and restore 100,000 acres, impacting 1.4 million people. Ecolab funding has helped directly protect 759 acres and influenced the protection on 60,481 acres along 99 miles of shoreline in the Upper Mississippi River watershed. In addition, 409 acres and 8,600 feet of shoreline have been restored. Most recently through our contribution, supply at the headwaters of the Mississippi River has increased by 16 million gallons (~61,000 cubic meters). Monterrey Metropolitan Water Fund | Mexico The Ecolab Foundation and TNC have built a productive collaboration around water security and since 2014 have restored and conserved over 293 acres of land in the Cumbres de Monterrey National Park, which provides over 60% of the Monterrey metropolitan area’s water supply. These activities have been aimed at improving water filtration, regulating water flow, reducing flood risk and strengthening water security and climate resilience for communities in and around Monterrey. Furthermore, our collaboration has also produced a community tree nursery that supplies trees for restoring the landscape and contributes to the livelihoods of local farmers. The nursery, launched in 2018, is currently producing 60,000 plants per year. These plants have the potential to reforest between 300 to 370 acres of areas devoid of vegetation in the Cumbres de Monterrey National Park. The tree planting also helps with water filtration and flow of both surface and groundwater to benefit 4.5 million people. China Urban Water Blueprint | China With Ecolab’s support, TNC made progress on groundbreaking work focused on sustainable water systems in China. This included making headway on the development of source water protection programs for the Dongjiang River Basin, the Qiandao Lake Basin and the exploration of a “sponge city” program in Shanghai. These projects use nature to create a more resilient water system in regions across the globe and will serve as critical demonstration sites, showing not only the physical connections between nature and cleaner water, but also how to engage stakeholders around a common purpose through innovative funding and governance frameworks. Ecolab also supported the development and publication of the China Urban Water Blueprint report, which analyzed the state of water in China’s 30 largest and fastest growing cities, informing TNC China’s decision to start two new water funds. The report offers science-based recommendations for natural solutions – including reforestation and improving agricultural practices – that can be integrated alongside traditional infrastructure to improve water security for people and nature. It provides a roadmap for action for water security through natural solutions, paving the way for new partnerships and subsequent work on source water protection. 41 ECOLAB CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 2021 |\n",
      "OUR APPROACH ENVIRONMENT SOCIAL GOVERNANCE APPENDIX ABOUT As part of our commitment to achieve a positive water impact, Ecolab is focused on improving water availability, access and quality in water-stressed communities around the world. In 2021, the United States federal government indicated a high likelihood that Lake Powell and Lake Mead in the U.S. Southwest could reach critically low levels in 2022.1 Without urgent action, hydropower generation and lake storage levels would be threatened, putting the 40 million Americans relying on the Colorado River water basin at risk. To help combat these outcomes, Ecolab helped fund a landmark water conservation project with the Colorado River Indian Tribes (CRIT) and the state of Arizona, one of the largest multi-sector collaborative drought response efforts ever achieved. Facilitated by Business for Water Stewardship, a program of the Bonneville Environmental Foundation, funding support helped secure 150,000 acre-feet of conservation to help shore up Lake Mead through the CRIT system conservation project. The nearly 49 billion gallons (~185 million cubic meters) of conserved water supports over 400,000 people each year. Of this total impact, Ecolab’s investment delivers a volumetric benefit of 19.2 million gallons (~73,000 cubic meters) of water per year over a 10-year period for a total of 192 million gallons (~730,000 cubic meters) of water. The landmark collective funding agreement from Ecolab and other Fortune 500 global business leaders alongside a philanthropic match is the single largest collaborative funding effort of its kind. Not only does the project help shore up declining water levels in Lake Mead, which has fallen to 36% of capacity, the lowest levels since it was filled in 1935, it helps delay and reduce future water shortages that would impact Arizona, Nevada, California and Mexico. The funding also supports the CRIT’s longer-term efforts to modernize irrigation systems and conserve additional water. BIODIVERSITY AND ADAPTATION Loch Leven | United States Within the Mississippi River Delta, the Lower Mississippi Alluvial Valley faces the potential loss of three critical wetland habitats, which would impact the health of numerous species. In partnership with TNC, Ecolab supports the Loch Leven project, working to restore and enhance 6,000 wetland acres and provide 12.1 billion gallons (~46 million cubic meters) of flood storage capacity to local communities. Ecolab’s contribution to this work allows for 100 million gallons (~380,000 cubic meters) of water replenishment in the Upper Mississippi River Basin. Upper Tietê watershed project | Brazil The Nature Conservancy’s Upper Tietê watershed project in Brazil is supported by the Ecolab Foundation. As part of Ecolab’s net positive water 2030 Impact Goals, nature-based solutions in high-risk watersheds where we operate help provide water replenishment. At this location, it is estimated that the replenishment is 29 million gallons (~110,000 cubic meters) per year over 10 years. Bonneville Environmental Foundation | United States A grant in 2021 to the Bonneville Environmental Foundation (BEL) supports water conservation efforts for Lake Mead in Nevada. Ecolab is a participant in BEL’s Business for Water Stewardship where over $4 million in corporate and philanthropic funding supports Arizona’s commitments to increase water supply reliability through a system conservation project with the Colorado River Indian Tribes (CRIT). This landmark corporate water stewardship investment is the single largest collaborative funding effort of its kind and complements existing funding from the state of Arizona to compensate the CRIT for conserving up to 150,000 acre-feet – approximately 49 billion gallons (~185 million cubic meters) of water – of the Colorado River. The funding supports conservation efforts that directly shore up declining water levels in Lake Mead and reduce the likelihood that shortage declarations will affect water supply for the state.

      "OUR APPROACH ENVIRONMENT SOCIAL GOVERNANCE APPENDIX ABOUT Making Measurable Progress Ecolab remains focused on reducing waste across our global operations through product and packaging design principles and manufacturing and waste disposal process controls. Packaging Design Principles We incorporate circular economy principles in our packaging designs, focusing on innovation to design out waste, reuse materials and enhance recyclability. We have a long history of pioneering packaging technology, in some cases reducing waste from traditional packaging designs by 99%. In addition, we were an early adopter of reusable containers for our concentrate products, as well as in the incorporation of post-consumer recycled plastic resin (PCR) into many of our packages. We utilized over three million pounds of post-consumer plastic resin in 2021. Waste Disposal Processes In 2021, we deployed our refreshed Waste Management Policy which focuses on a hierarchy of controls, guidance for waste minimization, proper waste storage and internal audits. Aligned with our Total Productive Maintenance (TPM) approach, we developed new tools for waste loss analysis and site-level risk assessments which embody Ecolab’s continuous improvement initiatives that are woven through all our sustainability programs. For example, Ecolab invested in a state-of-the- art wastewater treatment plant at our facility in Châlons-en-Champagne, France. The new wastewater treatment station uses water reuse technology supported by Nalco Water, Ecolab’s water and process management business, to reduce water discharge to the city sewer network by almost 80%. Facilities in Ecolab’s supply chain generate the majority of waste from manufacturing processes. Additional waste generated includes packaging materials, expired product, expired raw materials and product that is deemed out of specification. All Ecolab global supply chain facilities must verify that wastes are sent to disposal facilities licensed by local government agencies. Overall, Ecolab Global Supply Chain has a policy requiring facilities operating in locations with no local discharge requirements to meet the following criteria: pH between 6.0 – 9.0 s.u. and no color, foam, oil sheen or floating solids. These requirements were adopted from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Multi-Sector General Permit (MSGP) for industrial stormwater discharges. Ecolab has service agreements with waste companies that manage waste on Ecolab’s behalf. We have a robust internal process to qualify our waste disposal facilities, which are then approved by the Safety, Health and Environment department. For more detailed data on our waste practices, see the ESG Performance Data Appendix. In 2021, we saved more than 14 million pounds of newly produced plastic. Because of innovations in the way we formulate and package products for our customers, we have kept more than 116 million pounds of plastic out of circulation since 2014. 43 ECOLAB CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 2021 | WASTE Approach Ecolab is committed to implementing circular economy principles, including using materials and resources efficiently, reducing non-hazardous and hazardous waste in our operations, products and packaging and increasing reuse and recycling. Our commitment is operationalized through our Waste Management Policy, which establishes minimum waste management requirements and ensures responsible and legal practices for waste generation and disposal. Goals Ecolab‘s ambition is to package all products in reusable or readily recyclable packaging designs by 2030, unless prohibited by public health or regulatory requirements. Our key strategies to achieving our ambition are to: 1. Accelerate and expand reusable packaging programs 2. Shift to readily recyclable packages where reuse is not feasible Ecolab‘s ambition is to package all products in reusable or readily recyclable packaging designs by 2030.\n",
      "OUR APPROACH ENVIRONMENT SOCIAL GOVERNANCE APPENDIX ABOUT PRODUCT SAFETY AND SUSTAINABILITY Approach Ecolab continues to be a leader in product safety and sustainability. We have developed policies and programs to prevent or reduce human and environmental exposure to chemical products through a holistic engineering approach which includes chemistry composition, format, packaging, dispensing and digital control systems. Additionally, we use the Chemical Footprint Project, GHS classifications and Ecolab’s Impacts that Matter criteria, as well as proactive projects to continuously identify opportunities to increase product safety and sustainability. Product Safety We are committed to safety in our operations and developing products that are safe for our customers when used in their intended application. Ecolab’s product safety and stewardship program is foundational to the commitment to developing products and solutions that solve customer problems, while protecting the environment and promoting human health. This program is brought to life through our Product Safety and Stewardship Position. As part of our commitment, Ecolab has a long- standing history of implementing both hazard and risk assessment tools in our product development processes and we use a precautionary approach, meaning we strive to protect human health and the environment even in the absence of scientific certainty or regulatory requirements. Product Risk Assessment 100% of Ecolab’s raw materials and products are evaluated for strict compliance with applicable regulatory requirements and assessed by the Regulatory Affairs and business teams for human and environmental hazards using Globally Harmonized System of Classification and Labeling of Chemicals (GHS) and Organization of Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) standards. To thoroughly assess ingredients, we review publicly available information from reputable sources such as the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), United States Agency for Toxic Substance and Disease Registry (ATSDR), World Health Organization (WHO) and European Chemicals Agency (ECHA). We also require chemical ingredient suppliers to provide Safety Data Sheets (SDS) and technical datasheets to enable proper handling and classification of our materials and products. For select products, we conduct additional testing to validate any pertinent hazards identified in products or product ingredients and assess potential substitutions. When substitutions are not technically viable, engineering controls and appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) are required for product use. Product risks are also proactively evaluated by multiple groups within Ecolab – including Regulatory Affairs, Corporate Sustainability, Toxicology, Industrial Hygiene, Transportation and Package Engineering – and our Global Innovation Product Regulatory team reviews all new products for human health and environmental impact. If risks are identified, appropriate mitigation measures are implemented. One mechanism used to assess risks in our chemical portfolio is through our participation in the Chemical Footprint Project. We also use customer feedback from field representatives’ interactions with customers and customer input received through our technical call centers or third-party health and safety call centers to continuously assess our products. These processes inform our final product safety analysis and SDSs for all Ecolab products. 44 ECOLAB CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 2021 |\n",
      "OUR APPROACH ENVIRONMENT SOCIAL GOVERNANCE APPENDIX ABOUT 45 ECOLAB CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 2021 | PRODUCT SAFETY AND SUSTAINABILITY Classification and Labeling of Chemicals 100% of Ecolab products are reviewed for appropriate ingredient disclosure and accurate use and application instructions. We follow the GHS criteria for classifying our chemical ingredients and products and communicating product safety information. Ecolab has implemented GHS globally with over 95% of our products meeting the GHS standard and nearly 200,000 Safety Data Sheets (SDS) issued annually in approximately 74 different country-specific templates and 49 languages. Additionally, safe-use and disposal instructions are included on the product label and/or through our sales-and-service associates. 80% of Ecolab products have GHS category 1 and/or 2 warnings on the product due to our commitments to minimize our carbon footprint and packaging waste through the use of concentrated products. However, when used as directed, this percentage drops significantly, particularly across our Institutional North America portfolio, where over 75% of our products do not require any personal protective equipment. Ecolab has also innovated dispensing systems which prevent contact with concentrated chemistry to minimize risk. Participation in the Chemical Footprint Project In 2021, we continued our participation in the Chemical Footprint Project (CFP), which measures business progress toward safer chemicals and provides a tool for benchmarking companies as they select safer alternatives and reduce their use of chemicals of high concern. Ecolab completed this comprehensive benchmarking survey globally, included all business units in the evaluation and reported our performance to the CFP. European Union Substances of Very High Concern Ecolab’s products and operations are regulated by numerous different laws globally, including the European Union (EU) Substances of Very High Concern (SVHC) regulations in our European products and operations. Our Position on European Union Substances of Very High Concern describes incorporation of the SVHC Authorization List into our internal Chemical Product Ingredient Sustainability Policy in support of our target to eliminate the remaining <1% of Ecolab products which utilize these chemistries in our global portfolio. In 2021, we continued to focus on reducing or eliminating the small number of Substances of Very High Concern within our portfolio through the following: • Prohibiting development of new products containing SVHCs • Working rapidly to make low volume or low business value formulas containing SVHCs obsolete • Where a replacement technology gap exists, establishing projects and partnerships to define global alternatives to the most significant SVHCs • Initiating new internal reporting mechanisms to facilitate visibility to results and continue to increase management-level engagement Product Sustainability Ecolab’s product sustainability program establishes the basic principles to help ensure human health and environmental sustainability is embedded into the lifecycle of our products, in concert with our product safety and stewardship program. Our Product Sustainability Position, released in 2021, formalizes our commitment. Our Product Sustainability and Regulatory Affairs teams closely partner to implement our internal Chemical Product Ingredient Sustainability Policy and Impacts that Matter platforms across our businesses globally. By 2025, we plan to provide transparency to product sustainability impacts like greenhouse gas emissions and water use, biodegradability and aquatic toxicity. In 2021, we made progress toward this goal by continuing to develop tools that lend transparency to our products’ sustainability attributes. We integrated additional sustainability requirements into our product design process through instituting a major update to our Chemical Product Ingredient Sustainability Policy in 2021. This update expanded the list of managed chemical ingredients and improved processes to ensure these ingredients are not included in new products while simultaneously being phased out of current product use. We also took additional steps to embed product sustainability into our raw material selection process and now review all new chemical products for sustainability outcomes according to our commercial Impacts that Matter program. We continue to leverage our Impacts that Matter framework that aligns with eight, science-based and measurable product sustainability criteria. Impacts that Matter is a natural extension of our Exponential Return on Investment (eROI) value platform and allows Ecolab customers to make informed choices based on the outcomes products have on their teams, customers and the environment. Providing key product information through the Impacts that Matter framework helps explain and measure the impacts of Ecolab solutions. The technical information supporting product attributes is backed by our enterprise chemical management database.\n",

Everyday flexibility is a more informal arrangement that allows associates to address situations and meet personal and family needs that occasionally arise. FlexWork is a part of Ecolab’s culture, helping work get done effectively, given the constant challenges our associates face in balancing the many facets of life. We have a hybrid work model that allows associates, who are able to do part of their work remotely, the option to work up to 40% of the time remote with the balance spent in office. For additional flexibility, associates can work up to two weeks fully remote per year. The hybrid model balances the importance of in-person collaboration with remote work flexibility.\n",
      "OUR APPROACH ENVIRONMENT SOCIAL GOVERNANCE APPENDIX ABOUT BENEFITS Additionally, we provide resources to help our associates manage life outside of work. Offerings include discounts in childcare and tutoring as well as access to a caregiver search tools with over six million providers in the areas of childcare, eldercare, pet care and homecare. We also partner with Office Depot to offer discounts on office supply items and with PerkSpot to provide associate’s access to thousands of discounts in more than 25 different categories. We have vacation policies in accordance with national and state regulations in all countries in which we operate. As a company headquartered in the United States, our U.S. vacation policy offers a minimum of 12 paid vacation days to full-time employees. We offer sick time in accordance with national and state regulations in all countries in which we operate. As a company headquartered in the United States, our U.S. Health & Safe Time Policy offers six paid days of sick time to full-time employees. LABOR RELATIONS Ecolab respects the principles of freedom of association and the right to collective bargaining in accordance with applicable national law. Our Position on Freedom of Association recognizes an employee’s right to form or join a labor union, or to refrain from doing so, without fear of reprisal, intimidation or harassment. Where employees are represented by a legally recognized labor union, we fulfill our bargaining obligations as defined by the law. We respect that freedom of association is a fundamental right and recognize the right to collective bargaining as stated in the International Labor Organization (ILO) 1998 Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work. We adhere to applicable national laws that govern employee rights to exercise freedom of association and collective bargaining. Globally in 2021, 15.9% of our employees were covered by collective bargaining agreements, of which 6.5% were based in the United States. We had three U.S.-based collective-bargaining agreements in 2021 covering 2.6% of our total U.S. workforce. For these agreements, a minimum of 60 days’ notice prior to the contract end date is required to propose any changes to the contract agreements. All collective-bargaining agreements contain a specified notice period and provisions for consultation and negotiation. We adhere to U.S. National Labor Relations Board protocols to support employee rights to exercise freedom of association and collective bargaining. We have not identified any U.S.-based operations at which freedom of association and collective bargaining may be violated or at risk. We are unable to report on violations or risks of our suppliers. 50 ECOLAB CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 2021 |\n",
      "OUR APPROACH ENVIRONMENT SOCIAL GOVERNANCE APPENDIX ABOUT COMPENSATION Approach Ecolab has a market competitive and performance- based pay philosophy, and we believe in compensating our employees fairly and equitably. Goals Ecolab is actively working to improve representation of gender and race at each level of the workforce and as part of our 2030 Impact Goals, we are committed to pay equity and ongoing audits to maintain pay equity in the U.S. and expanding globally. Our variable pay programs include goals and targets that are directly aligned to the success of the business. Pay Equity We are committed to a market-competitive and performance-based philosophy as it relates to pay across the globe and rewarding and recognizing employees for their contributions to the success of the organization. This includes our global merit increase program and our short- and long-term variable pay programs. Our processes and governance for ensuring both performance-based and equitable pay decisions without regard for gender and race/ethnicity is consistent at the enterprise level and across significant locations of operation. There are several processes and practices in place to help ensure we don’t have pay discrepancies related to gender, race or other personal demographics including: • Annual and ongoing pay reviews and audits • Annual salary and bonus planning for eligible associates • Annual talent reviews • Ongoing pay alignment decisions such as hiring, promotions and transfers Pay decisions are made at the managerial level and aggregated for review and analysis across performance, gender and race to ensure equity. In addition to these enterprise practices, we also conduct pay equity reviews both in alignment with country regulations and simply because it is a part of good business and talent practice. Ecolab conducts a pay equity review in the U.S. for our total population every two years. The two-year cadence reflects the size and scale of our U.S. organization and allows us to analyze a few years of pay decisions. We leverage a third-party expert in compensation and HR analytics for these reviews and assess pay equity in general, with a special focus on gender and race. The findings of our 2018 and 2020 studies validate that Ecolab provides equal pay for men, women and all races/ ethnicities who undertake the same work, at the same level and with the same performance and experience. Our study for 2022 is underway. We are compliant with all local reporting pay equity regulations including public disclosure requirements in the UK and France. Fair Pay At Ecolab we require a variety of high demand, unique vocational and technical skills in entry-level roles. Consequently, our entry-level wages are on average two to three times higher than minimum wage regardless of gender across our significant locations of operation, which are defined as our manufacturing facilities and operation centers. We are committed to compensating our employees fairly and in compliance with local laws. We have established a minimum hourly rate of pay for U.S. employees of $15.00, which is significantly above local minimum wage in many cases. To ensure our pay continues to align competitively with the external market for all roles across the company, we test our pay and wage data against several reputable third-party compensation surveys. Our pay equity studies conducted across the U.S. enterprise every two years also help validate that we are paying competitively in each state. Pay Transparency We provide transparency to our pay philosophy, structures, career paths and program design to all associates globally. We are also open and transparent about our commitment to pay equity and the corresponding governance and analytics used to test and validate that we are paying equitably. Our compensation and governance practices are built into our manager and leadership development curriculum. Each of our annual compensation processes includes training materials for managers to guide performance-based decision making. Grievance mechanisms regarding compensation include our global Code of Conduct policy and reporting mechanism. In the U.S., our Ecolab Associate Resolution resources provide numerous avenues for employees to raise concerns and seek resolution. In 2021, the annual total compensation for our CEO was $8,365,888 as reported in the Summary Compensation Table on page 48 of our annual Proxy Statement. The annual total compensation for our global median employee in 2021 was $52,339. Thus, the annual total compensation for our CEO was 160 times the annual total compensation for our global median employee. 51 ECOLAB CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 2021 |\n",

These goals help use drive significant change to advance racial and social justice within our organization through: • Increasing management level gender diversity to 35% - representing a ~50% increase in representation from a 2019 base year – with the ultimate goal of gender parity • Increasing management level ethnic/racial diversity to 25% - representing a ~50% increase in representation from a 2019 base year – as we seek to meet full representation of the U.S. workforce at all levels Making Measurable Progress We employ a combination of strategies to help us on our path to meet our 2030 Impact goals around diversity including: • Demonstrating leadership from the top levels of our organization • Setting tangible, team-based goals • Creating more diverse candidate pools • Educating our employee base on the importance of diversity, equity and inclusion • Leveraging Employee Resource Groups Leading from the Top The Board of Directors reviews global diversity metrics on a quarterly basis, and senior executives and business leads review metrics monthly. In 2021, we celebrated four years of partnership and progress for our Executive Diversity and Inclusion Council, made up of senior leadership. In December 2021, Ecolab President and CEO Christophe Beck became a Catalyst CEO Champion For Change signatory. Together with over 70 other global companies and Catalyst, a leading global nonprofit helping to build workplaces that work for women, Beck made a personal commitment to support diversity, inclusion and gender equity at work. Creating More Diverse Candidate Pools that Accurately Reflect the Market and Industry To ensure diverse candidates are considered throughout the recruiting process, we use a multifaceted approach. All Ecolab jobs are posted through major social and recruiting channels as well as diversity specific job boards, like the Diversity Jobs Network. We ensure diverse communities know about Ecolab careers though our longstanding and critical partnerships with Historically Black Colleges & Universities (HBCUs), The Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers (SHPE), The Society of Women Engineers (SWE), The National Society of Black Engineers (NSBE), Competitive Advantage, Out4U and The Consortium. To activate diverse early career talent into our pipeline, our campus recruiting team partners with on-campus organizations that support women and underrepresented groups at the local, regional and national level. Our goal is for 100% of campus requisitions to have a diverse funnel of applicants that mirrors the market availability for each individual job. Finally, we focus attention on educating recruiters, interview teams and hiring managers on inclusion, diversity and bias through our Ecolab Interview Training courses to support managers in interviewing and selection of the best candidate. Through utilization of these strategies and others, in 2021, 38% of all new management-level hires globally were women and 35% of all new management-level hires in the U.S. were people of color. *Ecolab is committed to transparency and has chosen to publicly share our Employer Information Report (EEO-1) – a compliance survey mandated by U.S. federal statute and submitted to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.

      "OUR APPROACH ENVIRONMENT SOCIAL GOVERNANCE APPENDIX ABOUT DIVERSITY, EQUITY AND INCLUSION Setting Tangible, Team-Based Targets For the first time, we set targets for every team in terms of diversity, equity and inclusion. These targets were derived by understanding a team’s current status, identifying what is working and not working and pinpointing the gaps that prevent the organization from reaching their goal. Leaders receive monthly diversity metrics about their teams and report to senior leadership about their progress, their plans for addressing gaps and their differentiated development plans, which promotes equity by providing networking and professional development opportunities for diverse talent. Educating our Employee Base on the Importance of Inclusion We provide associates with regular opportunities to connect, listen and learn about our differences, to build empathy, understanding and allyship for one another. In January 2021, we held a Day of Understanding event which spotlighted women at work, gender equality, allyship and inclusion drawing over 8,500 participants to a town hall and more than 3,500 to breakout sessions. The event focused on the experiences of women in the workplace, sharing their personal career stories and discussing actionable steps towards creating a more equitable workplace. And to help associates have ongoing conversations, build trust and be better allies to those who face discrimination, over one third of our global workforce has completed an online Allyship in Action training course. This work will continue, collaboratively and within our company. To drive more economic inclusion within our communities, we are working to increase our spend with minority-owned and diverse suppliers throughout our supply chain. In 2021, we achieved a 96% increase in year-over-year spend with diverse suppliers. And we continue to support organizations dedicated to advancing racial and social justice, through our Ecolab Foundation giving and volunteer programs. It continues to be our responsibility to advance racial and social justice within our communities. That means we encourage our associates to keep talking, learning and seeking to understand – and keep working toward a better world for everyone. ALLYSHIP IN ACTION Following the death of George Floyd in our headquarters community of Saint Paul, MN in 2020, we pledged to provide more frequent opportunities for real conversations about race and to build a more inclusive culture across all our non-majority employee groups. The underlying issues of racism laid bare by Mr. Floyd’s death are still in front of us. Moving our society forward requires focused and consistent effort on many fronts as we continue to work for racial and social justice. Inside Ecolab, we have continuously accelerated our efforts to ensure we are a place where all people are welcome, respected and can thrive. We have set goals and are increasing racial and gender diversity, ensured equitable and competitive pay and embedded diversity, equity and inclusion principles in all manager training. We’ve had double-digit growth in our employee resource groups, which tells us that our associates find support and a sense of belonging from each other. And, to help associates have ongoing conversations, build trust and be better allies to those who face discrimination, over one third of our global workforce has completed an online Allyship in Action training course. Our leadership team, has been actively involved in a wide range of initiatives that the Minneapolis and St. Paul business community launched to advance racial equity, including police and public safety reform, expanded access to affordable housing, early childhood education funding and reducing health disparities. Ecolab leaders are also working on policy, philanthropy and workplace initiatives through the Minnesota Business Coalition for Racial Equity. We believe that the work of the business community in Minneapolis and St. Paul will have national and international impact, given the global spotlight that has been on our community. 54 ECOLAB CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 2021 |\n",

For example, E3, our employee resource group supporting the advancement of women in the workplace, leads a global mentorship program that provides members with career guidance, professional development and networking opportunities, and senior leadership exposure.

      "OUR APPROACH ENVIRONMENT SOCIAL GOVERNANCE APPENDIX ABOUT 56 HOW ECOLAB IS CREATING A MORE INCLUSIVE WORKPLACE FOR THOSE WITH DISABILITIES As part of our 2030 Impact Goals, Ecolab is committed to building a diverse, equitable and inclusive workplace that reflects our longstanding value of working together to integrate diverse perspectives, challenge ourselves, reach our goals and do what’s right. That includes supporting associates of differing abilities and in caretaking roles. Here’s what we’re doing: Providing Benefits Built to Support All Associate Needs Ecolab has provided medical benefits in the U.S. to support associates with differing abilities and in caretaking roles. These benefits are comprehensive and competitive in the marketplace and offer a broad range of quality programs, including occupational, speech and physical therapy, genetic testing and counseling, home health care and mental health services. In 2020, Ecolab introduced new U.S. caregiver benefits and resources. These new policies are focused on supporting the health and wellbeing of our employees and their families, including expanding flexible work options and discounted benefits and resources focused on childcare, school support, eldercare and home care. Reaching a Diverse Talent Through Partnership Ecolab has committed to expand recruitment of people with disabilities through consistent outreach with community and diversity partners. Today, we post job positions on non-government disability recruitment organization websites to attract diverse talent and email open positions daily through our community and diversity outreach program. This partnership connects Ecolab career opportunities with potential candidates from our community partners. With this information, they match the criteria we specifically request and share those positions with the appropriate members of their organizations, including minorities, women, people with disabilities, veterans, diversity organizations, universities and colleges, Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs), state workforce agencies, construction and skilled trades, and professional and technical groups. Creating Communities that Care Supporting people with disabilities and caretakers who support loved ones with disabilities is essential to Ecolab. In 2020, the company launched the Disability Ability & Wellness Network (DAWN), an employee resource group focused on supporting associates with differing abilities and those in caretaking roles. Working Toward Disability Inclusion Recently, Ecolab was recognized by the 2021 Disability Equality Index (DEI) as a Best Place to Work for Disability Inclusion by the American Association of People with Disabilities (AAPD), the nation’s largest disability rights organization and Disability:IN, the global business disability inclusion network. The DEI is a nationally recognized annual assessment for businesses to gauge their level of workplace inclusion for people with disabilities and a prominent benchmarking tool to help companies build a roadmap of measurable, tangible actions to achieve disability inclusion and equality. 56 ECOLAB CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 2021 |\n",
      "OUR APPROACH ENVIRONMENT SOCIAL GOVERNANCE APPENDIX ABOUT EMPLOYEE ENGAGEMENT We grow our business when we grow our talent and engagement is critical for team and company growth. Ecolab continuously monitors the health of our talent and works to build an engaged workforce through ongoing listening initiatives. In addition to all-employee global surveys, we conduct periodic check-in and small surveys with targeted teams to allow us to gather insights into the experience and needs of our workforce. Our enterprise-wide employee engagement survey was relaunched in 2021, with the intent to survey associates even more often than in the past – twice a year, instead of once every two. Completed in July 2021, the redesigned survey indicated an 89% participation rate, and an overall engagement score – a measure of our associates’ emotional commitment to our organization and goals – of 79%, an all-time high engagement score for Ecolab. The survey also provided us with feedback on our retention rate – how likely our associates are to build a long career with Ecolab – of 72%. We also saw great acceleration in our diversity, equity and inclusion journey with an inclusion index score of 79%. Inclusion is about our employees feeling valued, and fully seen for who they are within the workplace. Both retention and inclusion indicators exceeded the normal range for other similar companies at that time. There is still much more to do, and we must do it faster, but the strides that we have made are an encouraging sign that our commitment to creating a more diverse, equitable and inclusive culture here at Ecolab is having a real impact. Through the global survey, we identified areas of strength and opportunities, and have taken action on them both individually, and at the team and enterprise level. It is clear that our team values a sense of purpose, belonging and empowerment. Some of the areas that stand out as points to celebrate are that: • 91% of our associates feel they contribute to our mission to protect people and the resources vital to life • 89% of our team members feel that they have made valuable connections with the people they work with and share a sense of belonging at Ecolab • 88% of our employees feel that they have the knowledge and autonomy to do their best work At the enterprise level, one of the areas to focus on has been providing development opportunities for our associates at Ecolab. One of the improvements we began to plan in 2021 and intend to deploy in 2022 is our Career Hub, which will provide personalized career development connections, learning and experiences to associates based on their individual skills, interests and career profile. We have also implemented a new approach to continuous listening, leveraging the expertise of a third-party provider to deliver regular “nudges” to associates and managers, giving them AI-driven insights into small changes they can make to continuously improve engagement, retention and inclusion.

Our strategic initiatives closely monitor the health of our talent, strengthen our talent pipelines and drive accountability for continuous improvement. We have ongoing CEO-led reviews of talent and pipeline health. Reports with talent and diversity metrics are provided to top management monthly. Talent Council meetings for each business, market and function are held monthly to review talent development and discuss strategic talent initiatives. Additionally, annual talent reviews are conducted with senior executives to lay out succession plans for leadership and other key roles. This talent assessment process supplements the annual Performance Planning and Development process to ensure we proactively attract and retain talent that meets the needs of our growing global organization. Goals At our core, Ecolab’s growth is rooted in decades of science, learning and innovation. We have ambitious, solution-oriented teams and we continually look for ways to help our employees learn and grow. That’s why we aspire to do the following: • Maintain the steady state global enrollment of all first-line managers in our world-class Manager Essentials program • Have all new eligible global leaders of first-line managers complete the Leader Coach program and maintain steady state • Each year, have 90-100 of our high-potential executive-level leaders complete the Growth Leader program • Host annual Ecolab Development Week events and encourage all associates to engage in at least one development activity during that week and/or leverage one of these activities during the year Making Measurable Progress Through various learning processes and programs, we are providing associates with the tools they need to excel and developing the future leaders of Ecolab and the industry at large. Employee Learning and Development We believe in a 70-20-10 model for learning and development, with 70% of learning taking place on the job, 20% occurring with role models, coaches, mentors, job shadowing and formal feedback mechanisms and 10% through formal training. Our Employee Resource Groups (ERGs), formal learning programs and specialized continuous improvement programs provide formal coaching, mentoring and 1:1 career development opportunities for employees. In the United States, we also offer an educational assistance program providing eligible employees with financial reimbursement upon successful completion of approved programs and courses offered by accredited colleges, business schools or technical schools. Ecolab’s 12 ERGs hosted over 375 events across 85+ global chapters in 2021. Event topics ranged across professional and personal development, diversity, equity and inclusion, healing and self-care and perspectives from senior leaders. In total, associates collectively spent almost 20,000 hours participating in ERG-led events. Additionally, we delivered our fourth annual Ecolab Development Week to provide practice-oriented workshops to upgrade employee skills and advance career development. The 2021 Development Week comprised of 355 completely virtual events hosted in 43 countries with over 25,000 active enrollments and 7,700 unique learners. Leadership Development Programs Beyond rigorous technical, functional and business- specific training courses, our global development programs are designed to deepen leadership capability and include Manager Essentials, Leader Coach, Growth Leader and several functional rotational programs. Supplementing these corporate offerings, our divisions and functions also provide leadership development opportunities tailored to the unique needs of the business. In 2021, we achieved steady state deployment of our flagship front-line manager development program, Manager Essentials, with 1,644 completions in 2021. We also provided our Leader Coach program, for the leaders of our first-line managers, to 487 associates in 2021.

      "OUR APPROACH ENVIRONMENT SOCIAL GOVERNANCE APPENDIX ABOUT HEALTH AND SAFETY Approach At Ecolab, the safety of our employees and contractors is our top priority and is embedded into our company values. Our safety goals are simple: zero accidents, zero injuries and zero violations. This is a collective goal in which each employee must commit to, own and deliver on every day of the year. Year-on-year, we also strive to incrementally improve safety at all our sites to protect employees and communities. Our Board of Directors Safety, Health and Environment (SHE) Committee is the highest governing body responsible for Goal Zero and execution is managed by our Executive Safety Leadership Council and Regional Safety Leadership Councils in all regions and large markets. Our leadership teams and a network of SHE professionals around the world support employees with proven safety programs, processes, and platforms to help achieve the goals, and our training and onboarding programs provide leading metrics upon which to measure company performance. Understanding underlying and potential risks is a critical component to improving safety outcomes. Our Global Safety Dashboard tracks our performance on a range of leading and lagging safety indicators and helps us measure the effectiveness of our safety programs. Our approach to safety communications is aimed at encouraging employees in the field, offices and plants to embrace safety as a personal issue. We highlight different topics to raise awareness, encourage positive safety behaviors and eliminate risk. Protecting Employee Safety During COVID-19 To help reduce the risks due to COVID-19, Ecolab established a phased pandemic model based on prevalence of the virus in the community. Ecolab established both internal and external safety protocols based on guidance from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and other major public health organizations and evolve those protocols as we learned more about best practices to reduce the risk of COVID-19. Ecolab leaders in each country have continuously mapped local conditions to the phased model and implemented the relevant protocols as their phase status changed throughout 2021. Additionally, Ecolab provides many programs and tools to reduce risks for employees, including enhanced sick time, pay protection, work from home support and personal protective equipment. Prioritizing Safety Everywhere Our safety goal is always zero incidents. But Goal Zero is more than a number. We place great value on training and education, both at our own facilities and at customer locations. We assess risk before we start work, identify and address safety issues, and remedy hazardous situations — at any Ecolab location and wherever we operate. By 2030, we aim to train and educate 100% of our associates to work safely 100% of the time. In 2021, we made strides toward this goal. For more detailed data, see the ESG Performance Data Appendix.

We execute systems in our global operations to ensure management leadership and commitment, employee involvement/participation, coverage of legal and customer requirements, communications, risk identification and control, development of annual targets and plans, professional SHE resourcing and employee training. Our systems help ensure we meet our legal obligations in our countries of operation, including but not limited to, the US Occupational Safety and Health Administration, UK Health & Safety Executive, German Occupational and Safety Act, Canadian Centre for Occupational Health and Safety and China’s Workplace Safety Law. As part of our continuous improvement efforts, we are continuing our multi-year process to more fully align our systems to the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 45001 international standard, which builds on earlier international standards including the Occupational Health and Safety Assessment Series (OHSAS) 18001, the International Labour Organization’s (ILO) ILO-OSH Guidelines and other standards. In some cases, we are also working to align with standards promulgated by industry groups with which we partner such as the American Chemistry Council’s Responsible Care Management System. To date, approximately 32% of our workforce is covered by systems that have undergone internal management system audits and 19% is covered by systems that have been audited externally. Occupational Health Services Our Regulatory Affairs team of toxicologists, industrial hygienists and scientists conducts safety assessments of chemical products to characterize health and physical hazards in alignment with the Occupational Health and Safety Administration’s (OSHA) Hazard Communication standard and other relevant standards in jurisdictions where we operate, assess risk and generate Safety Data Sheets and labels which are made available publicly. To further assess risks, we carry out periodic occupational exposure evaluations including air monitoring, noise assessments, risk modeling and ergonomic evaluations. Toxicological studies are commissioned where necessary and relevant occupational exposure limits and control mechanisms are identified via these processes. Hazard communication training is completed globally for all newly hired employees in relevant roles. We have also issued a global Industrial Hygiene Policy to guide employees in assessing risk, monitoring contaminants when necessary, controlling occupational hazards through a hierarchy of controls and to stop work if conditions remain concerning. When necessary to further limit exposure, administrative controls are deployed such as additional, targeted training and use of personal protective equipment. Our global Personal Protective Equipment Policy requires identification of proper protective equipment for each job, employee training and systems to ensure equipment is available regardless of jurisdiction. We also offer recurring medical evaluations coordinated by contracted occupational physicians and health care providers to employees in select positions. Product information is provided to a contracted external poison control center (PCC) and transport incident call center which provide 24/7 emergency response services. We have quarterly meetings with the PCC to review incident calls, provide feedback on service quality and ensure product information is up to date.\n",
      "OUR APPROACH ENVIRONMENT SOCIAL GOVERNANCE APPENDIX ABOUT HEALTH AND SAFETY Employee Participation in Occupational Health and Safety Committees Employee participation in our occupational health and safety systems is critical to maintaining our safety culture. Our physical locations including manufacturing plants, research facilities and logistics operations commonly have joint safety committees composed of hourly employees, union representatives (where applicable) and management personnel. These committees operate in an advisory capacity in accordance with applicable legal and Ecolab requirements and meet quarterly at a minimum. Our remote, sales-and-service teams also can participate in safety committees through our Safety Champion processes. Each sales district nominates a Safety Champion to represent them in health and safety matters. Safety Champions commonly work with business leaders and SHE staff to execute our safety strategy and programs and participate in monthly network meetings. Employee Training Ecolab maintains a Global Safety, Health, and Environment Training Policy requiring all Ecolab operations to establish minimum requirements for training based on an assessment of operation- specific risk, applicable local or national laws and regulations and employee job responsibilities. This includes establishing new hire or transfer orientation training requirements. Each operation is required to determine appropriate training methods and frequencies, ensure training is delivered prior to risk exposure, document the completion of training and review training programs at least every three years. Below are a few examples of our training programs and activities. • Manager Essentials | Instruction on safety leadership principles and behaviors for all people managers through our Manager Essentials program. • Stop Work Authority Training | Training to empower employees to utilize their stop work authority whenever they feel unsafe and when and how to apply that authority. • Driver Safety Training | Behind-the-Wheel (BTW) training is designed to teach vehicle control and accident-avoidance techniques. Our goal is to have 100% of our recently hired driver population to complete training in 2022. • Safety Onboarding | Divisional safety onboarding processes are designed to provide newly hired sales-and-service personnel with basic safety training. The training includes eight modules of cross-divisional training (SOS® Core) and additional division-specific content. In 2021, our target was to have 100% of employees complete Safety Onboarding training within their first 30 days of employment. We achieved an 89% completion rate. Hazard Identification, Risk Assessment and Incident Investigation Our Global Risk Assessment Policy outlines requirements for all divisions, functions and markets to assess, communicate and control operational hazards and risks for routine and non-routine tasks and emergency situations. The policy requires these risks be managed through a hierarchy of controls which prioritizes eliminating hazards and substituting less hazardous materials or processes over using engineering controls, administrative controls and personal protective equipment. Formal risk assessments completed by trained safety professionals are made available to all employees that have the potential to be exposed to certain risks and are used to better target controls and training. Personal risk assessments are completed by all employees prior to the completion of daily tasks and all new hires are trained in our personal risk assessment methodology. To ensure the quality of these processes, Ecolab has developed numerous employee training programs, guidance documents and tools to improve our risk assessment techniques. Through our Global Risk Assessment Policy, Global Safety, Health & Environment Position and Code of Conduct, we empower all employees to report work- related hazards and conditions, and to stop work when conditions or behaviors are unsafe. Our global Code of Conduct establishes personal responsibility for establishing and maintaining a safe workplace and requires employees to promptly report health and safety concerns to their supervisor, regional SHE representative, Human Resources representative or if necessary, appropriate emergency authorities. We also deploy electronic, web-based tools throughout our global operations to assist all employees and non-employees under our control in reporting incidents, near miss events and general hazards. Our proactive approach to risk identification at our locations and customer facilities enhances our comprehensive safety program and improves results. In 2021, our achievements included: • More than 206,000 safety observations • More than 29,000 commentary drives to improve driving techniques and safety practices • More than 14,000 drivers using the Virtual Risk Manager driving application to help improve driving techniques and safety practices • 113 safety audits – due to COVID-19, many of which were done remotely Our Incident Investigation Policy outlines responsibilities and processes for investigating all incidents, including near miss events, within 24 to 48 hours (depending on severity). Investigations are designed to identify hazards, risks and root causes associated with an incident. Corrective actions to reduce future risk are identified based on the hierarchy of controls, and we periodically review action closure and effectiveness to continuously improve the system. 62 ECOLAB CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 2021 |\n",
      "OUR APPROACH ENVIRONMENT SOCIAL GOVERNANCE APPENDIX ABOUT HEALTH AND SAFETY Emergency Response Program and Procedures Our goal is to have zero safety incidents. However, incidents and emergencies involving worker safety, chemical spills or releases, natural disasters or other product or operational incidents can happen. To prepare for these unlikely events, we are committed to implementing and maintaining strong emergency preparedness and response systems to control, mitigate and minimize the impact on safety, property and the environment. This is part of our commitment to the safety of our workers and the communities where we operate. Ecolab’s Safety, Health and Environment (SHE) Committee of the Board is responsible for overseeing potential risks requiring emergency response, as well as the effectiveness of emergency preparedness and response systems. We maintain enterprise-wide guidelines on how to prepare for and respond to emergencies including Incident Management Plans and Crisis Notification and Reporting Procedures. In addition, we have emergency response teams and business continuity plans in place at all levels of the organization including at the site, country, region and enterprise levels. Our manufacturing plants regularly test our emergency response plans with local first response agencies and we host regular crisis training sessions throughout the world. We regularly review our emergency management programs across our businesses to ensure that they are functioning as intended and identify opportunities for continuous improvement. Following an incident, we conduct a thorough review, sharing key learnings and recommendations with emergency response teams and senior leadership, and adjust crisis plans for future use. Prevention and Mitigation of Impacts at Customer Locations Our health and safety management systems are designed to minimize risks in all our operations, including delivering products and services to customers worldwide. Our Regulatory Affairs team, which includes more than 200 scientists and professionals operating in 35 countries with backgrounds in chemistry, microbiology, toxicology, trade compliance and other disciplines, ensures we minimize product risks. In addition, we deploy training, risk assessment and mitigation techniques to ensure our team of more than 25,000 sales-and-service professionals operate safely as they conduct business at customer locations.

      "OUR APPROACH ENVIRONMENT SOCIAL GOVERNANCE APPENDIX ABOUT COMMUNITY INVOLVMENT Community Giving Since 1986, the Ecolab Foundation has implemented community impact programs to support communities where our employees live and work, focusing on giving to local non-profit organizations in four strategic areas: youth and education, civic and community development, arts and culture and environment and conservation. Since the inception of the Ecolab Foundation, the company has contributed more than $139 million to non-profit organizations. In 2021, Ecolab and its employees committed more than $41 million to local communities through Foundation and corporate giving, in-kind donations and employee giving and volunteerism (using the value of volunteerism per Independent Sector). Of this, employees gave nearly $3 million to nonprofit organizations around the world through the Ecolab Community Giving Program. Approximately 28% of the Ecolab Foundation’s funds in 2021, or $2.2 million, were committed to 590 unique organizations (including matching funds to employee donations) supporting youth education and development. Grants were awarded to well- known youth organizations such as Boys and Girls Clubs and Junior Achievement, as well as to local after-school and in-school programs in communities where our employees live and work. In 2021, Ecolab provided $1.1 million of direct and indirect funding to Saint Paul Public Schools in our global headquarters city of St. Paul, MN, where 53% of students are eligible for free or reduced-price lunch. In addition to continued funding for the Ecolab Teacher Grant Program, where staff and teachers apply for programs and materials directly impacting district aligned student achievement goals in their schools and classrooms, Ecolab approved grants to community partners that work with Saint Paul Public Schools. Ecolab has targeted partnerships with schools on the West side of Saint Paul where we specifically support programming at Humboldt Schools, Riverview West Side School of Excellence and Cherokee Heights Elementary School. Examples of directly funded initiatives include college preparatory and access programs (AVID and College Possible), S.T.E.M. in-class and out- of-class offerings, and subsidized admission to performing arts organizations. Another of the Ecolab Foundation’s focus areas is that of civic and community development. In 2021, $5.5 million of grant funding supported organizations that provide basic needs to our most vulnerable citizens: access to food, housing and job training. Of the 413 nonprofits who were awarded grants through the Foundation’s Nonprofit Grant Program, 89.5% of them indicated that their grant addresses decreasing disparities for one or more of these groups: ethnically diverse (non-white) individuals, individuals with disabilities, LGBTQ+ individuals, veterans, women and girls or another area of diversity. Through the Ecolab Foundation’s Dollars for Doers and Board Leadership programs, employees can apply for grants to qualifying non-profit agencies where they undertake 25+ hours of volunteer work annually or board leadership involvement. In 2021, 134 grants were distributed under these programs totaling more than $55,000. Ecolab also recognizes the giving spirit of our employees and their desire to make financial contributions in their communities. Through the Global Ecolab Community Giving Program, Ecolab Foundation matches 50% of employee donations, up to $1,000, per employee per year (some restrictions apply). In 2021, the Ecolab Community Giving Program raised nearly $3 million for more than 2,600 nonprofits around the world and the Foundation matched employees’ requested donations totaling $575,000. Taking into account total employee engagement impact in 2021, including employee personal donations, the Foundation match to those personal donations, the value of volunteer grants and volunteer hours, the total impact to nonprofit organizations through these employee engagement initiatives was $4.2 million. 64 ECOLAB CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 2021 |\n",
      "OUR APPROACH ENVIRONMENT SOCIAL GOVERNANCE APPENDIX ABOUT COMMUNITY INVOLVMENT We are committed to empowering employees to give back in communities where we have significant operations. To facilitate local engagement and impact, we have Community Relations Councils in 16 regional locations around the U.S. involving close to 100 local Ecolab employee volunteers who help administer the Ecolab Foundation Nonprofit Grant Program. These local employees are most in touch with the needs of their communities and are well equipped to help determine which organization they believe contributions can have the greatest impact. In 2021, these committees help administer 297 grants to non- profits and schools totaling $1.5 million. Volunteerism In the second year of the global COVID-19 pandemic that necessitated many employees continue to work from home, volunteer activities continued to be offered virtually and we saw the ongoing delay of projects, although some were able to be held safely outside. Nonetheless, Ecolab employees were engaged as an asset to their communities, giving time and talent. In 2021, 1,491 employees volunteered in at least one effort for an average of 0.3 volunteer hours per global employee. This provided a value of $414,480 to employees' local communities. Community Partnerships Solutions for Life is Ecolab’s global giving program that enhances our mission to conserve water and improve hygiene around the world through collaborations with non-governmental organizations (NGOs), global philanthropy and employee volunteerism. Solutions for Life is funded by Ecolab through the Ecolab Foundation. Through Solutions for Life, Ecolab supports the work of strategic global nonprofit partners such as The Nature Conservancy, Project WET Foundation and Water.org. The Nature Conservancy Ecolab continues to support its partnership with The Nature Conservancy (TNC) securing and restoring water sources around the globe. Region-specific examples of positive impacts from our partnership with TNC in Brazil, China, Mexico and the United States are available in the Biodiversity and Adaptation section of this report. Project WET Through our partnership with the Project WET (Water Education for Teachers) Foundation, children around the globe are learning about water conservation and hygiene through a youth-focused curriculum, called the Clean and Conserve Education Program. Since launching the partnership in 2014, the program has reached more than eight million individuals in 98 countries with its fun, hands-on lessons about water conservation and healthy hygiene practices. The Clean and Conserve curriculum resources, along with training videos, can be downloaded in multiple languages free of charge. In addition, Ecolab sponsors Project WET’s Discoverwater.org, an interactive website that hosts free activities – currently available in English, Spanish and Mandarin – about the role of water in our lives. In 2021, the website welcomed 200,000 unique users. Water.org Ecolab continues its partnership with Water.org to enable access to sustainable drinking water and improved sanitation for 100,000 people living in poverty in India, while contributing more than 26 million gallons (~98,000 cubic meters) of water per year to watershed health in extremely high-stress river basins. Our partnership with Water.org is an example of how we are taking action to help build community and economic resilience and equitable access to freshwater.

The business and affairs of the Company are managed under the overall direction of the Board of Directors to support sustainable solutions to economic, environmental and social issues. To assist it in carrying out its duties, the Board has delegated certain authority to five standing committees: Audit, Compensation, Finance, Governance and Safety, Health & Environment. INTEGRITY AND ETHICS We are committed to upholding the highest legal and ethical standards, regardless of when and where we conduct business. To that end, we have adopted specific standards, policies and procedures to help us maintain our commitment. Ecolab has an established Global Compliance department which is led by the Chief Compliance Officer, along with regional compliance leaders. In addition, Compliance and Ethics committees meet at least biannually in each region to help ensure strong communication with regional leadership. Available in 27 languages, our Code of Conduct (Code) is the foundation of our integrity and ethics principles and applies to all Ecolab Directors, officers and employees and serves as a guide for how to act and make ethical decisions in compliance with the Code and the laws of the countries where we do business. Employee Training All new employees participate in a facilitated two- hour training session on the Code of Conduct and are required to read the Code and acknowledge compliance. On an annual basis, all Ecolab employees and almost all contingent workers are required to participate in an online or in-person training course and provide certification of completion and compliance. In addition, all governance body members are required to certify compliance with the Code every year. Our annual goal is to have 100% of global employees, including all senior managers, complete the training and certify to comply. In 2021, we had a 99% global completion rate. The Code of Conduct does not apply to third-party organizations providing security personnel to Ecolab facilities. The Code of Conduct training includes education on relevant laws and regulations. In addition, targeted specialized training for those employees in certain areas or functions is also provided. For example, employees in accounting and finance roles receive training specific to that function, and certain employees may be required to take anti-bribery and anti-corruption training based on relevant business responsibilities or interactions. Conflicts of Interest Under Ecolab’s Code of Conduct, employees are required to disclose any potential conflict of interest. A conflict of interest disclosure form is available for employees to use and is included in the annual Code of Conduct training. The Global Compliance department reviews submitted conflict of interest disclosures and determines if they can be approved. Sometimes approvals are contingent upon mitigation and monitoring. Conflicts that are not disclosed through this process may be problematic and may be investigated under Ecolab’s Code of Conduct program. Business Security Under Ecolab’s Code of Conduct, we require that employees protect Ecolab’s confidential information, as well as our customers’, and suppliers’. To help accomplish this, Ecolab has a Chief Privacy Officer as well as an Information Technology (IT) Security department that partner to help protect confidential information and data. Ecolab has policies and procedures in place to help employees understand how to handle sensitive data. Employees are required to complete IT Security training on an annual basis. In addition, certain IT security controls are put in place as additional measures. Advisory Services Ecolab requires oversight of advisors by requiring that the procurement of such vendors follow our internal global procurement policies, and that there are no known conflicts with Ecolab employees.

In addition, the internal Audit department conducts operational, anti- bribery and anti-corruption audits to help ensure that data is accurate. Certain data analytics tools are used to allow for larger data samples to gain greater assurance of data accuracy across the global enterprise. Ecolab also sets forth records management requirements in its Global Records Management Policy and Global Records Retention schedule. Reporting Mechanisms Employees have the option to report a Code concern to their manager, the Human Resources, Compliance or Law departments, or Ecolab’s third-party Code of Conduct helpline or web reporting service which are utilized by internal and external reporters to convey concerns and is available 24 hours a day, seven days a week.

Ecolab’s Global Compliance department leads all company investigations to ensure they are thorough, consistent and appropriate action is taken, which may include disciplinary measures up to, and including, termination. Ecolab prohibits retaliation. Ecolab has a Global Investigations and Reporting Process that is followed for internal investigations to ensure that each investigation is thorough, fair, accurate and timely. If certain legal concerns arise, Ecolab may engage outside counsel. Ecolab has a worldwide whistleblower program managed by the Global Compliance department which ensures that reports are investigated in a timely manner and consistent action is taken based on the results of the investigation.

Ecolab’s Anti- Corruption Policy is available in 24 languages and requires all intermediaries operating or exporting outside the United States to sign and maintain current anti-corruption undertakings communicating our policies. The Anti-Corruption Policy provides extensive guidance on the requirements for engaging with third parties. The associated procedures are risk-based, meaning in higher risk countries and business units, more extensive procedures are required. The procedures generally include a business manager qualification form, third-party questionnaire, a background check and internal approval requirements. All third-party intermediaries globally are required to follow this rigorous approval process. The purpose of the procedures is to obtain the necessary information for our evaluation and review of a third party’s business, skill, capabilities and ability to comply with our legal and ethical standards. Ecolab is then able to determine whether a third party shares our values, in the following ways: • Companies that have sound anti-corruption programs and openly report have a competitive advantage beyond meeting any compliance obligation. They benefit from risk reduction, cost savings and sustainable growth. • Companies can demonstrate their response to the legal obligation and responsibility to reduce the risk of corruption that represents a commitment to operate an ethical business. Ecolab’s Anti-Corruption Policy requires all intermediaries to execute anti-corruption undertakings. If a third party refuses to comply with Ecolab’s Anti-Corruption Policy, this raises a significant risk and can lead to the termination of the relationship. We also require certain vendors, including a third party, to certify that they have not and will not violate basic anti-corruption laws, and this is a condition to do business on Ecolab’s behalf. Finally, Ecolab’s Anti-Corruption Policy requires continuous monitoring of third-party compliance with our values. We require existing third parties to undergo an approval process every three to four years, depending on certain risk-based factors. Based on these risk factors, Ecolab will perform an internal attribute-based access control (ABAC) audit, and if necessary, audit the third parties to ensure they are in compliance with our Anti-Corruption Policy. Training Ecolab’s anti-corruption policies and procedures are communicated through the annual Code of Conduct training, which is mandatory for all employees and almost all contingent workers globally.

In addition, Ecolab undertakes compliance and ethics assessments to better understand human rights related risks. Supporting Policies and Positions • Our Code of Conduct contains detailed human rights aspects relevant to our operations and requires Ecolab employees to report any potential human rights issues. • Our Ethical Sourcing Standards communicate to our vendors and business partners our expectations on human rights and ethics and our standards for operation, including addressing implications of the UK Modern Slavery Act and the California Transparency in Supply Chains Act. • Our Supplier Code of Conduct sets out expectations for suppliers in the areas of integrity, ethical and legal standards and compliance among other topics. • Our Anti-Human Trafficking Policy communicates our expectations around slavery and human trafficking. • Our Conflict Minerals Policy supports human rights organizations to end violence and atrocities in Central Africa, specifically the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and nine adjoining countries. Due Diligence Processes We conduct annual assessments led by the Global Compliance department to identify legal and regulatory compliance risks in 14 risk areas, including the assessment of human rights issues. Recommendations from the assessment process result in the creation of action plans and corrective actions or remediation, if deemed appropriate. Effectiveness of these actions are tracked through supplier audit results, legal review results, work- related accident results, operational audit results and Code of Conduct data. Reports are provided to top management and the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. To evaluate and address the risk of human trafficking and slavery in supply chains, Ecolab has developed a detailed supplier ethical assessment that top suppliers in parts of Ecolab’s business where there is an elevated risk of slavery and human trafficking must complete to verify compliance with Ecolab’s ethical sourcing requirements. Suppliers must also agree to Ecolab’s Supplier Code of Conduct. Disclosure It is Ecolab’s policy to disclose any human rights controversies which may relate to child employment, female or minority rights infringement, or other issues pertaining to human rights as defined by the EEOC.

      "OUR APPROACH ENVIRONMENT SOCIAL GOVERNANCE APPENDIX ABOUT SUPPLIER RELATIONS Approach Our Supplier Code of Conduct includes expectations around human rights, ethics, labor rights, employment law, health and safety, environment, fair competition and supplied materials. The Supplier Code applies to the selection and retention of all suppliers that provide goods and/or services to Ecolab worldwide, including raw material suppliers, semi-finished or finished goods suppliers, packaging suppliers, contractors, contract manufacturers and service providers/suppliers. Suppliers are expected to comply with the Supplier Code of Conduct in the course of doing business with Ecolab and its employees. To ensure full understanding of these expectations, Ecolab publishes this policy in 13 languages. Suppliers are expected to comply with all applicable country labor, employment and environmental laws and regulations, and meet our Ethical Sourcing Standards regarding forced labor, child labor, health and safety in the workplace, fair pay, harassment, diversity, ethics and environmental policies. Our supplier requirements are based on international standards including the UN Declaration of Human Rights, the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child and the Conventions of the International Labor Organization (ILO) including its Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work. Environmental Considerations We require that suppliers have systems in place to prevent and mitigate pollution, avoid the use of hazardous materials where possible, engage in reuse and recycling activities, avoid environmental impacts with the potential to adversely impact human health or the environment and have systems in place to conserve and optimize the use of natural resources sustainably, such as energy, water and materials. The scope of our sourcing requirements includes the carbon emissions footprint of our individual suppliers (Scope 3), as well as the total carbon impact of our own supply chain (Scope 1 and 2). When analyzing our suppliers carbon impact, which is comprised of over 15,500 direct and indirect suppliers, we found that their carbon footprint is ten times larger than our own. As part of Ecolab’s science-based emissions reduction target, Ecolab has committed to work with suppliers representing 70% of Scope 3 emissions (covering purchased goods and services, capital goods, upstream transportation and distribution, business travel, and downstream transportation and distribution) to set ambitious carbon reduction targets aligned with the science-based target methodology by 2024. In 2021, Ecolab launched our first supplier sustainability survey to over 400 different suppliers to assess their current carbon and water reduction targets. Through this process, we found that suppliers accounting for 25% of Scope 3 emissions covering purchased goods and services, and downstream transportation have set, or are in the process of setting, science-based targets. Overall, suppliers who have already set science-based targets account for 6.5% of Scope 3 emissions (covering purchased goods and services, capital goods, upstream transportation and distribution, business travel, and downstream transportation and distribution). By working with our supply chain partners to adopt aggressive climate goals, Ecolab is accelerating meaningful action to mitigate climate change. Screening Process Our suppliers go through a methodical screening process before being added to our portfolio, which includes detailed legal, financial, operational, quality and reputational risk assessments. For high-risk suppliers and suppliers deemed critical to Ecolab’s business, we conduct on-site assessments. Ecolab’s Supplier Code of Conduct and Ethical Sourcing Standards are used to screen 100% of new suppliers for social and environmental criteria. In addition, we have published an Anti-Human Trafficking Policy and Conflict Minerals Policy which communicate additional details on our expectations for suppliers. To ensure compliance with our Conflict Minerals Policy, new suppliers are asked if they have their own internal program/policy and if they have identified the risk it presents in their supply chain. 72 ECOLAB CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 2021 | Training To reinforce supplier expectations internally, we conduct an online, annual training for Supply Chain, Research and Development and Regulatory Affairs associates to help them identify environmental, ethical and labor concerns when interacting with suppliers.

The ethical sourcing survey evaluates compliance with Ecolab’s Supplier Code of Conduct and Ethical Sourcing Standards and covers health and safety, ethics, employment practices, diversity, harassment, environmental policy and environmental sustainability, including energy consumption, greenhouse gas emissions, waste management and water consumption. To evaluate and address risks of human trafficking and slavery in its supply chains, Ecolab developed a supplier ethical assessment. In parts of Ecolab’s business where there is an elevated risk of slavery and human trafficking, suppliers complete this assessment to verify compliance with Ecolab’s ethical sourcing requirements. Ecolab has required such suppliers in the chemical, packaging, equipment and contract manufacturing categories to complete the assessment, and we plan to expand the number and scope of suppliers required to complete the assessment. The U.S. Department of Labor issues an annual List of Goods Produced by Child Labor or Forced Labor, which is generally consistent with lists issued by organizations such as Walk Free Foundation. The 2021 U.S. Department of Labor List identifies 156 goods produced by child labor and/or forced labor in 77 countries. Goods on the List that are, or may be, in Ecolab’s global supply chain include palm oil from Malaysia and Indonesia and silica-based products and electrical components/electronics from China. Ecolab’s Global Procurement team has begun monitoring multiple sources of information on forced labor to identify potential risks within our supply chain. In 2022, a forced labor survey was conducted and targeted suppliers that we believed were of higher risk based on location, commodity and spend. Suppliers were questioned not only on their policies, but on management practices and specific performance related to protection of employees’ human rights and prevention and elimination of trafficking and slavery. The Ecolab Procurement team also monitors suspected incidents of trafficking or slavery identified by governmental agencies such as the U.S. Customs & Border Patrol and requires suppliers of potentially impacted products to verify that no products supplied to Ecolab are sourced from entities suspected of trafficking or slavery. Ecolab’s business lines, including the manufacture and sale of cleaning chemicals and provision of water, hygiene and infection prevention services to other businesses, have not been identified by the International Labor Organizations’ (ILO), Walk Free or other organizations as high-risk industries. Of the twenty countries with the highest estimated prevalence of modern slavery, based on the Walk Free Foundation Global Slavery Index, Ecolab does business in three countries, including Nicaragua, Russia and China representing approximately 7% of Ecolab’s global procurement spend and 1,073 suppliers. We have not received reports of evidence or indications of modern slavery within our operations or our industry sector. Reporting We have established a Code of Conduct hotline to facilitate reporting of potential violations by internal and external stakeholders. Any concerns flagged through the ethical sourcing survey or Code of Conduct hotline are fully investigated, and mitigation steps are put in place to improve supplier performance and eliminate risk. If significant and urgent concerns are identified that cannot be remediated, suppliers are removed from Ecolab’s approved list. 73 ECOLAB CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 2021 |\n",
      "OUR APPROACH ENVIRONMENT SOCIAL GOVERNANCE APPENDIX ABOUT SUPPLIER DIVERSITY Approach Supplier diversity at Ecolab means driving equitable competition and economic inclusion. We believe: • The best teams and partners are diverse and inclusive. • Solving complex problems requires diverse perspectives and experiences. • Driving our partner marketplace to equitably reflect our diverse society is core to our values. Doing so makes us more attractive to customers, employees and investors, an employer of choice and a stronger partner to both our customers and the communities in which we live, work and serve. We define diverse suppliers as a small business as defined by CFR Title 13, Chapter 1, Part 121, or a supplier certified by one of the following organizations or agencies: National Minority Supplier Development Council (NMSDC), National Gay and Lesbian Chamber of Commerce (NGLCC), Women’s Business Enterprise National Council (WBENC), US Pan Asian American Chamber of Commerce (USPAACC), Disability:IN, federal government agencies – including Veteran Affairs agencies – and/ or state or local government agencies. Goals In 2021, Ecolab continued to make progress on elevating supplier diversity goals and objectives across the enterprise. Plans and measures were shared frequently with executive leadership on goal progress, and we ensured the appropriate targets, resources and tools were put in place to double our spend with diverse suppliers by 2022. In 2021, we implemented the following actions to increase diverse supplier spend and supplier outreach and engagement: • Updated North America Procurement Policy to include diverse suppliers in all go-to-market sourcing activities where a diverse supplier can meet product and customer requirements • Added external partnerships with Minority Supplier Development United Kingdom (MSDUK) and the United States Hispanic Chamber of Commerce (USHCC) • Participated in and sponsored local and national business outreach activities • Implemented first phase of a supply chain extended reporting program (Tier 2) • Increased training and awareness within the procurement organization and among business stakeholders To continue this progress, we will rely on our strong foundation of sound procurement practices and advanced data and analytics, expand our base of strong customer and partner relationships and implement several key growth opportunities to reach our 2022 goals. Making Measurable Progress Ecolab’s 2021 spend with diverse suppliers totaled approximately $204 million, or 5.4% of all U.S. procurement spend. This is a 96% increase over our reported 2020 spend of $105M. Ecolab conducted business with over 650 diverse suppliers in all categories of diverse spend in 2021, representing a 30% increase over 2020. Supporting Local Suppliers Fundamentally, we choose to buy from suppliers within the markets in which we operate that abide by the ethical and sustainability goals set forth by our company. We base our purchasing decisions on safety, quality, service and price, opting to purchase within the market whenever possible to minimize emissions from shipping materials overseas and support local economies. More than 90% of our purchases are from local suppliers within our markets. Local community is defined as the major markets in which we operate, including Asia Pacific, Europe, Greater China, India, Middle East and Africa, Latin America and North America. Significant locations of operations are defined as our manufacturing facilities and operation centers within the markets in which we operate. 74 ECOLAB CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 2021 |\n",
      "OUR APPROACH ENVIRONMENT SOCIAL GOVERNANCE APPENDIX ABOUT POLITICAL ACTION Public Policy Engaging with policymakers is one means of furthering our sustainability objectives. We communicate with policymakers in proactive policy discussions, bringing our market segment and scientific expertise to the table on water, waste, food safety and customer health issues to ensure public policy decisions are grounded in principles of sound science. Ecolab engages with federal and state legislative and regulatory bodies, industry and customer trade associations and non- government organizations that provide a forum for environmental policy discussion relevant to our industry. These include a diverse set of stakeholders which focus on water-related issues and climate mitigation and adaptation issues to influence climate policy. We maintain a formal process to manage all direct and indirect engagement with policy makers and related organizations to ensure we have a common approach consistent with our business strategy. This process covers the scope and business impact of specific policy issues and is integrated into the annual business continuity and risk management assessment process so any activities that influence policy are evaluated for alignment with Ecolab’s strategic corporate business strategy. If inconsistent, these are immediately flagged for action by the Government Relations team. Political Contributions Ecolab’s Political Contribution Policy provides an approval process for corporate political contributions by a committee of executives, as well as an annual review of the policy and political contributions by the Governance Committee of the Ecolab Board of Directors. In 2021, Ecolab Inc. contributed $30,000 to the Democratic Governors Association, $30,000 to the GOPAC, Inc. and $5,000 to the Republican Governors Association. Ecolab associates can also support the company’s political action committee, the Ecolab Inc. Political Action Committee (ECOPAC). ECOPAC, which is funded by voluntary contributions from Ecolab associates, is a nonpartisan committee that supports candidates for U.S. Congress who share our basic philosophies and values. It contributes to legislators from across the country where the company transacts business. Contributions are determined by a board of Ecolab executives based on criteria including representation of Ecolab facilities and/or significant base of employees, committee membership, committee leadership, positions on issues and partisan balance. ECOPAC does not support candidates for local or presidential office. A list of all political contributions by ECOPAC and Ecolab is posted semiannually to the Ecolab website under Political Contribution Reporting. Membership of Associations Industry and policy groups have a unique ability to influence standards, regulations and practices.

This is a categorization model to convert $USD spend based on relevant NAICS sector categories into carbon emissions associated with the extraction, production and transport of purchased goods and services, capital goods, upstream transportation, downstream transportation and a portion of business travel acquired or purchased by Ecolab in the reporting year. • Upstream emissions from purchased fuels, elec- tricity, steam and hot and chilled water, include generation and T&D emissions, and any other losses in this category. Data quality is consistent with inputs from our global database on sustainability metrics. Upstream emissions of purchased electric- ity are calculated for the US and other countries by multiplying electricity activity data by country or region-specific emission factors from UK Defra 2021 Guidelines for GHG Reporting. Upstream emissions from purchased fuels, steam, hot and chilled water are calculated using emissions factors from UK Defra 2021 Guidelines for GHG Reporting.

Data quality is consistent with inputs from our global database on sustainability metrics. Data on waste quantity are obtained and reported from global sites. Emissions from waste are calculated using methodologies and emission factors from the EPA’s Waste Reduction Model (WARM), version 14, March 2019. Landfill emissions factors are used directly from WARM. This model bases its emissions calculations on a life-cycle analysis, including emis- sions from the long-term decomposition of waste in a landfill and upstream sources/sinks. GWPs are from the IPCC (2007) Fourth Assessment Report. For all categories except landfill, the WARM method has been adjusted to align with the GHG Protocol’s Corporate Value Chain (Scope 3) Standard, based on emissions for transport to destination and processing of materials prior to reaching the end destination (be it recycling, incineration or other). • The scope of business travel emissions is global.

      "OUR APPROACH ENVIRONMENT SOCIAL GOVERNANCE APPENDIX ABOUT REPORTING CHANGES AND RESTATEMENTS FOR 2021 REPORTING PERIOD Adjustments and Restatements of Information in Previous Reports Ecolab first developed an inventory of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions as part of our commitment to reducing our carbon footprint in 2007. In 2009, we expanded the primary inventory to include other key operational environmental impacts including, but not limited to, water withdrawal, wastewater discharge and waste disposal. During completion of these 2021 inventories, data and methodological gaps were identified and corrected, which impacted historical inventories and data. We also continue to implement many new data-management collection processes to maintain our energy and water invoices for all owned and operationally controlled fixed facilities. This serves as another way to perform internal and third-party auditing of this data. Globally, Ecolab had an 83% invoice-compliance rate in 2021, meaning that 83% of all energy and water invoices from all owned and operationally controlled fixed facilities were used to compile 2021 data. Net sales are adjusted to constant 2015 dollars to factor out inflation when normalizing Ecolab’s emissions performance against the base year, following best-practice guidance from the GHG Protocol and EPA Climate Leaders. Ecolab’s net sales are adjusted for inflation using Producer Price Indexes (PPI) from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Greenhouse Gas, Water, Wastewater and Waste Inventory Changes In 2018 we changed the accounting method we use to report GHG emissions progress against our climate targets from location-based to market-based. Primarily, this allows us to account for the renewable electricity purchases we are making in North America, Europe and other regions. In 2020 Ecolab completed a significant divestiture of its upstream energy business. Ecolab’s greenhouse gas, water, wastewater and waste inventories for 2019 and years prior have been revised to account for this divestiture. In 2020 Ecolab revised its Scope 3 Use of Sold Products emissions for prior years due to methodological improvements in estimating product sales. For the 2021 reporting year, Ecolab has restated its historical Scope 3 emissions for purchased goods & services, capital goods, upstream transportation and distribution, and downstream transportation & distribution categories due to improvements in procurement spend data collection and categorization. 92 ECOLAB CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 2021 | REPORT VERIFICATION AND EXTERNAL ASSURANCE Apex Companies, LLC (formerly the HSE division of Bureau Veritas North America, Inc.) provided third-party assurance for Ecolab’s publicly reported 2021 Corporate Responsibility Report.

      "Environmental Footprint SHERWIN-WILLIAMS 2021 SUSTAINABILITY REPORT Building on the Good 20 Climate and Carbon Our Climate Strategy Our climate strategy reflects our Company’s comprehensive global effort to reduce our greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. We strive to ensure our work in this area captures every part of our business – from transportation and materials sourcing to the products we manufacture and sell. While it has long been a priority, our climate strategy has evolved over time. From 2009 to 2020, we focused our efforts on reducing our GHG emissions intensity, which is the rate of GHG emitted per 100 pounds of product produced. In 2021, we aligned our climate strategy to reflect a science-based targets approach influenced by the Paris Agreement and its goal to limit global warming to well below 2.0 degrees Celsius. Our 2030 goal of reducing our absolute Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions by 30% compared with a 2019 baseline was developed on this basis. We determined tracking and weighing our absolute GHG emissions, rather than setting an intensity-based goal, better aligned with the global need for mitigating the physical amount of GHGs emitted into the atmosphere over time. We are taking a comprehensive approach to achieve our 2030 goal, which includes, but is not limited to, virtual power purchase agreements, solar installations, introducing electric vehicles into our fleet and energy efficiency improvements in our operations. We are aligning our climate-related analysis and reporting with the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) framework as part of our efforts to quantify our environmental footprint, assess our climate risk, demonstrate transparency and operate in alignment with recognized industry best practices. This framework will continue to serve as a tool to help us further evaluate our climate-related risks and opportunities, while measuring our progress in line with global standards. In addition, since 2006, Sherwin-Williams has voluntarily participated in CDP’s Climate Change reporting initiative, which catalogs our climate change-related risks, opportunities, governance and communications as they relate to our carbon output.

By the end of 2021, through a series of successful rollouts, the pilot program grew to include 22 vehicles with electric technology – with future expansion of EVs and hybrid technology on the horizon. “The goal of the project is to prepare and test the technology,” said Joseph Lukacs, Sherwin-Williams Global Director of Fleet Operations. “This will help us determine if utilizing EVs is feasible in both our passenger and delivery fleets, without impeding sales or service.” Lukacs and his team worked with suppliers to identify a series of EVs that would fit Company needs. “For example, one of our subcompact hatchback vehicles in the pilot program has a range of 240 miles and a payload capacity of 500 pounds,” Lukacs explained. “This is perfect for handling smaller loads where space provides a challenge for the larger delivery vehicles – all while giving off zero emissions.” The Fleet Operations team plans to continue the momentum by engaging broader testing groups across multiple divisions throughout the Company, while continuing to monitor new technology. The continuation of this expansion supports the Company’s commitment to reduce our carbon emissions; the more electric and hybrid vehicles we add to our delivery and sales fleet, the less gas-powered energy is consumed Company-wide. “It’s an exciting time and ultimately we want to show there are areas in which technology can help,” Lukacs concluded. “This drives home the commitment Sherwin-Williams has to sustainability and dedication to being on the forefront of new technology.” AWARDING OUR FLEET EFFORTS Joseph Lukacs, Sherwin-Williams Global Director of Fleet Operations, received the inaugural Innovation Partner Award from fleet management company LeasePlan USA, and was the runner-up for Fleet Professional of the Year by Automotive Fleet Magazines.

      "Environmental Footprint SHERWIN-WILLIAMS 2021 SUSTAINABILITY REPORT Building on the Good 23 Focusing on Renewable Energy Sherwin-Williams has established a goal to increase electricity from renewable sources to 50% of total electricity usage by 2030. To help us achieve this goal and our 2030 carbon reduction goal, we are exploring a variety of renewable energy mechanisms and tools. Our options may include, but will not be limited to, on-site renewable energy generation at some Company locations, virtual power purchase agreements (VPPAs) and renewable energy credits (RECs). In 2021, we began work on an on-site solar project at our Orlando, Florida, plant, which builds on the success we have had using solar energy at our plants in Dresden, Germany, and Minerbio, Italy. We are also taking steps to procure VPPAs in the U.S. While we are still assessing our renewable energy options and the potential for VPPAs in other markets, we believe these initiatives will support the mitigation of our carbon footprint in the long term. Improving Energy Efficiency in Our Stores We believe seemingly minor changes made at a large scale can equate to a substantial impact. Since 2019, The Americas Group (TAG) has worked to reduce electricity and gas consumption at our paint stores by replacing traditional thermostats with smart thermostats. Smart thermostats can be centrally monitored and controlled based on a store’s operational hours to maximize energy savings. The installation of these units typically results in a 15% reduction in energy consumption per store. We continue to evaluate individual stores to look for ways to bolster our energy efficiency. DRESDEN COATINGS FACILITY EMPLOYEES HELP PROTECT WILD BEE POPULATION In Germany and across the globe, habitats of wild bee populations are being destroyed, leaving the species in danger. Team members at our Sherwin-Williams General Industrial facility in Dresden completed a project in 2021 to protect and support the wild bee population on the property. Facility employees surveyed the area and created a plan to improve the grounds where bees and other insects could live harmoniously.

Widely viewed as the most energy-efficient lighting solution, LED products keep spaces well-lit while offering significant cost savings. A global initiative to upgrade to LED bulbs and lamps in 113 Sherwin-Williams manufacturing facilities is underway and will help the Company achieve its goal of increasing operational energy efficiency by 20%. In the Europe, Middle East, Africa and India (EMEAI) region, the Bellö, Sweden, facility electricians are updating fluorescent and incandescent lighting products with new LED bulbs – averaging around four bulb replacements each month. The facility is currently seeing a 39% energy reduction for plant lighting since implementation began. In the Latin America (LATAM) region, Sumare manufacturing facility employees in São Paulo, Brazil, are working to replace 168 fluorescent bulbs with LED solutions. With a nearly 30% return on investment (ROI) for this project, the facility team plans to reduce its power needs by approximately 190,000 kilowatt hours per year. Similarly, our Orlando, Florida, plant is experiencing significant benefits from updating its on-site lighting. In 2021, the team saw a cost savings of $60,000 after the bulb installation and noted a decrease in slips, trips and falls, in part due to the improved LED lighting. Brandon Garnet, Sherwin-Williams Global Supply Chain (GSC) Divisional Continuous Improvement Manager, spoke about a project underway to upgrade lighting to LEDs in our North American GSC facilities. “We wanted a turnkey solution,” he said. “We are currently working with a vendor to help us implement LED lighting in all 39 North American facilities.” Spotlighting LED Installation in Manufacturing Facilities In 2022, the team will start with the four largest sites – Buford, Georgia; Greensboro, North Carolina; Fredericksburg, Pennsylvania; and Massillon, Ohio – with the project estimated to be complete by 2025. “By converting our GSC manufacturing facilities to LED lighting by 2025, we should experience a significant savings of total kilowatt hours per year,” Garnet said. “This project alone equates to 10% of our overall goal for electrical reduction across our supply chain. I’m proud to be part of a monumental sustainable change, and I can’t wait to see how the project positively affects the environment, Company and employees over the next few years.”\n",

Waste Reduction Sherwin-Williams continuously strives to reduce waste in our operations. Our waste reduction efforts focus on two primary areas: 1) Reducing the amount of waste that we generate; and 2) Increasing our reuse and recycling. All Sherwin-Williams manufacturing facilities have unique waste reduction targets and programs. Our waste reduction initiatives are commonly centered on improving quality control processes, reducing the number of distressed batches of product, managing raw materials and conducting finished product inventory, thereby eliminating the waste before it is generated. In 2021, our Global Supply Chain (GSC) division began value stream mapping our operations to get a better understanding of our waste processes. The value stream mapping tool systematically reviews the energy consumption and waste generation of each step in the manufacturing and distribution process, providing a living document to help build a pipeline of sustainability projects. Sherwin-Williams has a long history of reusing and recycling byproducts of our production process and incorporating excess raw materials, off-specification paint and wash water back into production as alternative raw materials in the manufacture of new batches. We are proud of these efforts and continue to encourage our facilities to maximize this activity. All facilities have defined recycling programs in place where materials such as cardboard, paper, plastic and metal are diverted from the waste stream. Recycling rates at all our large manufacturing, distribution, administration and laboratory facilities are tracked globally using our EcoMet database. Waste that is unable to be recycled or reused is managed in accordance with applicable regulations and corporate guidelines. In 2021, the Company recycled approximately 40% of total waste generated. As part of our product stewardship initiatives, Sherwin-Williams supports the recycling of post-consumer paint through our participation in the PaintCare® paint recycling program. We have been involved in the PaintCare program since its inception in 2009 and have collected more than 3.5 million gallons of paint for recycling since 2018. The nonprofit program, which is currently available in 10 states and the District of Columbia, is managed by the American Coatings Association and helps keep unused and discarded paint out of residential waste streams. PaintCare attempts to reuse and recycle the leftover paint and containers before properly disposing of any remainder.\n",

The automated cameras, which continuously monitor the containers, notify the facilities’ waste management providers when the dumpsters are full. This investment helps cut back on unnecessary collections and subsequent emissions from waste trucks. These cameras can also identify when foreign materials are placed into the waste dumpsters, which helps stores reduce contamination and improve their recycling percentage.

We are presenting both sets of data for consistency and comparison reasons. The goal for 2030 represents a 25% reduction in waste disposal intensity (all waste streams) compared with the baseline year of 2019. We expect this reduction will be achieved by focusing our operations to drive toward zero solid waste to landfill and by maximizing reuse of manufacturing byproducts, such as wash water, on-site. In 2021, our amount of waste treated and disposed was impacted by a combination of factors, including cleanup of equipment at several closed manufacturing facilities (which generated more waste and higher waste intensity than ongoing production would have generated at those facilities) and a decrease in the availability and economic viability of recycling outlets for our waste.

      "Product Blueprint SHERWIN-WILLIAMS 2021 SUSTAINABILITY REPORT Building on the Good 31 Aligning the Sustainability by Design program with our Stage-Gate process clarified and streamlined our approach for business implementation. Comprehensive training reinforced the importance of sustainability and increased our teams’ awareness and understanding of the Sustainability by Design process and how it relates to daily functions and procedures. We made this training available to employees, including our research and development (R&D) and marketing teams. In addition, we enhanced our Sustainability by Design program by creating a digital tool that enables our product designers, marketers and formulators to better identify and create more sustainable solutions. The tool facilitates goal setting, the categorization of products with specific sustainability attributes and enhances employee accessibility and understanding of our Sustainability by Design program. Use of this new tool allows us to: • Enable R&D teams to assess environmental and toxicological hazards • Standardize our method for organizing and categorizing our products • Improve our ability to monitor and measure key performance indicators (KPIs) • Streamline employee involvement within the process PARTNERING WITH SUPPLIERS TO BUILD ON THE GOOD We pride ourselves on the relationships we have with our suppliers and regularly engage with them to maintain a supply chain in which continuous improvement and sustainability principles are at the forefront. Throughout 2021, we enhanced collaboration within our network of suppliers to Build on the Good. A driving focus in these collaborations has been our Product Blueprint. Through supplier engagement, we have pursued opportunities to improve product sustainability, including using renewable feedstocks and more sustainable raw material alternatives. These collaborations have provided insight and a better understanding of our Scope 3 emissions. In 2021, our inaugural Technical Achievement in Sustainability awards were given in recognition of high-performing employees who made contributions toward expanding our “sustainably advantaged products” portfolio. A Growing Portfolio of ‘Sustainably Advantaged Products’ Sherwin-Williams has a long and distinguished history of producing “sustainably advantaged products” by aligning with industry-leading guidelines and third-party certifications. “Sustainably advantaged products” are products that achieve a level of third-party green chemistry, ecolabel or similar recognition, or can be shown to be more sustainable than what is currently the norm for the industry. Throughout 2021, we continued to expand our portfolio of “sustainably advantaged products.”\n",
      "FEATURE STORY Product Blueprint SHERWIN-WILLIAMS 2021 SUSTAINABILITY REPORT Building on the Good 32 As an industry leader in the development of best-in-class product technology, we are expanding our portfolio of “sustainably advantaged products” that meet, and often exceed, third-party green chemistry, ecolabel or similar recognitions. With growing demand for more sustainable construction materials, the importance of validation from third-party governing bodies is evolving into an essential requirement for many commercial projects. Certifications from third parties utilize benchmarking standards (scoring) set by governing partners, such as the U.S. Green Building Council’s Leadership in Energy and Environmental DesignTM (LEED®) green building program, to meet standardized criteria. Third-party validation through partners, such as Underwriters Laboratories® (UL) and NSF International, is considered credible with customers as these organizations possess the expertise to conduct an impartial evaluation of key sustainability attributes. For sustainability deliverables, such as Environmental Product Declarations (EPDs) and Material Ingredient disclosures, programs like LEED recognize products with third-party validations as 1.5 products in the calculation as opposed to one product each for those that are self-declared. Sherwin-Williams was the first coatings manufacturer to have Material Ingredient disclosures externally validated, a move beyond the LEED requirements at the time. “This validation stems from an objective third party coming to conclusions regarding components going into the product and identifying the potential hazards,” explained Doug Mazeffa, Sherwin-Williams Global Sustainability Director. Mazeffa has served on leadership committees with the U.S. Green Building Council, which oversees LEED. “We support employees engaging and providing input to facilitate collaborative development of building product manufacturing standards.” Specifiers and applicators, along with other industrial customers, are seeking coatings that deliver optimal performance while meeting these third-party requirements. Sherwin-Williams offers these professional customers optimal solutions while obtaining the sustainable building credits their customers need. “We are proudly raising the bar and delivering value to our customers by developing ‘sustainably advantaged products’ and adding third-party validations to address concerns associated with self-declarations,” Mazeffa added. “Sherwin-Williams has been leading the charge in transparency and credibility for our programs and products.” The Company also led the industry as the first coatings manufacturer to estimate its products’ environmental impacts through EPDs. “These are third-party-validated by NSF International,” Mazeffa said. “Sherwin-Williams has more EPDs than any other member of the coatings industry.” The Global Director describes EPDs as “an environmental nutrition label” – with disclosures around a product’s carbon footprint and energy consumption needed to achieve certain LEED credits. “Sherwin-Williams was also the first in the industry to publish LEED-eligible Action Plans to support the optimization credits for both EPDs and Material Ingredients,” Mazeffa concluded. “We offer the most LEED-eligible products in our industry.” Delivering ‘Sustainably Advantaged’ Solutions\n",
      "Product Blueprint SHERWIN-WILLIAMS 2021 SUSTAINABILITY REPORT Building on the Good 33 Life Cycle Assessment at Sherwin-Williams At Sherwin-Williams, we produce paint and coatings that protect the appearance and longevity of the structures and products to which they are applied, resulting in reduced life cycle impacts and costs for our customers. We have a rigorous and science-based life cycle assessment (LCA) program, which is the foundation for an expanding number of Environmental Product Declarations (EPDs) on our architectural and industrial product lines. Our process starts with deciding how a particular product will be evaluated and the environmental attributes to be studied. The LCA evaluates factors such as raw material consumption, distribution to retail centers, customer travel to purchase and apply the coating, usage considerations and packaging. Subsequently, we develop an EPD, which standardizes environmental impact information to provide transparency regarding the product’s environmental footprint and eligibility for credit in green building programs such as LEED®. EPDs are an important tool to help specifiers and users compare various products. A key component of our LCA process is life cycle thinking, during which we consider and quantify impacts throughout our value chain. This includes assessing impacts throughout the product life cycle – from raw material extraction to product disposal at end-use. We highlight considerations for how we may innovate and develop a product as well as partner with suppliers, distributors and customers. Through life cycle thinking, we can better understand the systems and variables through which our products interplay. This improves our ability to address customer needs, prioritize sustainability attributes such as performance and collaborate with key stakeholders within our value chain to align actions. Following the implementation of our enterprise-wide Sustainability by Design program throughout 2021, LCA continues to be a valuable tool for measuring the sustainability impacts of existing products and developing additional “sustainably advantaged products.” PRODUCTS THAT DRIVE PRODUCTIVITY HAVE SUSTAINABILITY ADVANTAGES Developing products that increase productivity is essential for the Sherwin-Williams commercial market – for the benefit of our customers and to progress our Company-wide sustainability goals. Our product development teams continue to operate with a productivity mindset, helping to advance products that work harder for our customers once application is complete. For example, Scuff Tuff® Interior Water-based Enamel provides heightened durability and abrasion resistance. It was developed for use in high-traffic spaces that are prone to wear and tear, such as apartment complexes and commercial buildings. Following application, the product maintains a quality finish longer than typical architectural coatings, reducing the number of repaints needed over time. LATITUDE® Exterior Acrylic with ClimateFlex Technology™ also provides great benefits for our commercial customers. This technology provides early moisture resistance, smooth application at extreme temperatures (35°F-120°F) and a durable finish that protects against peeling, cracking and dirt pickup in harsh climates. The exterior coating provides painters the ability to perform jobs that would traditionally need to be rescheduled, ultimately cutting down total painting time and the need for additional weather-related touch-ups. LEADERSHIP IN SUSTAINABLE ARCHITECTURAL PRODUCTS A large number of our architectural “sustainably advantaged products” meet or exceed sustainability criteria set by leading third-party organizations, programs, standards and codes such as: • American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) • Collaborative for High Performance Schools® (CHPS) • Cradle to Cradle Products Innovation Institute • EU Ecolabel • Green Globes® • GREENGUARD Environmental Institute (GEI) and UL GREENGUARD • International Green Construction Code® • Leadership in Energy and Environmental DesignTM (LEED®) • Nordic Swan Ecolabel • The Master Painters Institute® • USDA BioPreferred® Program • WELL Building Standard® For more information on our certifications and regulatory obligations for our architectural products, see the product reference guide on our website.\n",

      "Social Imprint SHERWIN-WILLIAMS 2021 SUSTAINABILITY REPORT Building on the Good 36 We have formal systems and programs – like the TLC Stay Safe Out There campaign – to help employees “find, own, fix and report” workplace EHS hazards before they lead to an incident. Every manufacturing site has a safety action plan and conducts monthly training to reinforce specific focus areas and ensure the implementation of best practices. Employees then use what they have learned to audit their personal workspaces. The effort shows that all employees – regardless of their role – can directly impact the safety of the workplace. Occupational Health and Safety S-W Cares The safety of our employees and customers is a core value. S-W Cares is our safety culture initiative to define a roadmap for achieving environmental, health and safety (EHS) excellence across the Company. It puts resources, policies and accountability in place to deliver on our EHS commitments. It also provides a governance structure that is supported by tools to continuously measure our efforts to ensure safe workplaces, protect the environment and meet or exceed regulatory requirements. Each letter in “cares” defines an expectation for our teams and leaders to sustain and improve our safety performance. To embody S-W Cares, our leaders and teams must: Champion Lead by example Act Find, own and fix issues Recognize Reward individual and team EHS efforts Empower Allow people the time to support a safe and healthy work environment Share Share successes and best practices Our People-Centric Culture We are committed to the fair, consistent and equitable treatment of our employees in relation to working conditions, wages, benefits, policies and procedures.

      "Social Imprint SHERWIN-WILLIAMS 2021 SUSTAINABILITY REPORT Building on the Good 37 One EHS Management System Across Sherwin-Williams Our EHS Management System (EHSMS) covers all Sherwin-Williams facilities across our three reportable segments – The Americas Group (TAG), Consumer Brands Group (CBG) and Performance Coatings Group (PCG) – and our Global Supply Chain division, which is managed within CBG. During 2021, we focused on further centralizing and standardizing the implementation of our EHSMS and began to socialize and communicate these changes throughout Sherwin-Williams. Culture, in the form of S-W Cares, is at the center of the EHSMS. The most significant change from previous iterations is clear definition and implementation guidance for the five essential components of the EHSMS: • Culture • Planning • Implementation and Operations • Verifications and Process Accountability • Action Management and Continuous Improvement Our intention moving forward is to utilize standardized EHSMS processes and tools, including site plan templates, checklists and worksheets, which are adaptable for all parts of the organization. This approach enhances clarity and consistency and further ingrains continuous improvement into our functions and responsibilities. We began this initiative by rolling out the more formalized set of tools for EHSMS implementation to our manufacturing locations. This process is ongoing, and we intend to continue socializing and implementing it across our organization in 2022 and 2023. Ambitious Safety Goals As we continually strive to achieve zero recordable injuries, we have set ambitious safety goals for 2025 in the following areas: • Process Safety: Drive a continuous improvement maturity path by having all 65 global manufacturing sites advance within our four-tier blueprint to minimize disruptive fires and spills across the enterprise • Safety & Risk: Achieve a recordable cases rate (RCR) of 0.8 • Occupational Health: Reduce the number of ergonomic injuries by implementing at least two interventions per year at each manufacturing site ENHANCING SAFETY AT OUR STORES In the spirit of a centralized strategy that gives stores and facilities the flexibility to do what works best for them, we continue to develop segment-specific initiatives. This includes the 2021 expansion of our tactical EHS handbook and companion mobile app for the unique operations of our retail stores. These widely used tools were effective at the sales floor level in improving safety awareness and increasing safe behaviors. We encouraged store implementation and use of the TAG EHS handbook and mobile app through our TLC Stay Safe Out There campaign. This initiative is organized into three levels – bronze, silver and gold – with each level associated with enhanced safety performance. TAG’s Environmental, Health, Safety and Transportation team continued to drive injury reduction and sustainability improvements. TAG’s 2021 results included a 37% reduction in recordable injuries, a reduction in the number of hazardous waste generating stores, and progress toward a hybrid and electric delivery fleet. We continue to set goals for district managers to drive consistent progress at the local, district and regional levels. Throughout 2021, we focused on stores moving from a base level to the bronze level, with approximately 99% of stores achieving this goal. This bronze level ensures that many known injury causal factors in stores were routinely evaluated and, when identified, corrected in our store environment. In 2022 and beyond, we expect the balance of our stores to reach the bronze level and for many of our stores to progress from bronze to silver and ultimately to gold.\n",
      "Social Imprint SHERWIN-WILLIAMS 2021 SUSTAINABILITY REPORT Building on the Good 38 In assessing our safety performance and history of ergonomic injuries, we have identified repetitive, manual handling of 5-gallon pails as a key ergonomic risk factor in our operations. To address this risk, we have assembled a continuous improvement team to document all engineering and administrative controls for pail handling and have published several training videos on how to properly lift and handle a 5-gallon pail. The sharing of best practices across our organization is central to our ergonomic intervention efforts. We facilitate this by making ergonomic intervention information available to all sites electronically via an ergonomic control solutions webpage. This collaborative approach helps our sites learn from each other and reinforces our belief in “not having to fix the same thing twice.” To recognize the ergonomic accomplishments of high-performing teams and plant managers, we celebrate successes and milestones with our annual Ergo Excellence Awards. Sites participate by submitting their intervention actions. Winners are selected to acknowledge their focus on ergonomics. Our 2021 Ergo Excellence Award winning sites were Singapore, with an ergonomic process redesign, and Garland, Texas, with an inline checkweigher, which eliminated a large amount of manual handling. Collaboration Between Divisions Drives Continuous Improvement Our EHS practices and procedures are overseen by a steering committee that includes senior leaders from our three segments, as well as our Global Supply Chain division. An EHS Council, comprised of representatives from each segment and division, sets and tracks goals that are reported to the steering committee, as well as members of the Sustainability Council. The EHS Council also functions as a think tank, allowing divisions to share learnings and leverage improvements. Collaboration between divisions about EHS topics has dramatically increased and helped drive Company-wide improvements. “For several months, we discussed and listened to each other about what would make the management system work,” said Brian Haynack, Sherwin-Williams EHS Director – Strategic Excellence. “That was so valuable to gain an understanding of where the business wants us to take this.” As we have introduced programs like PSM and other initiatives that encourage a centralized approach to EHS management, leaders within our EHS governance structure have proven instrumental in providing oversight and encouraging implementation division-wide. 2021 Safety Performance Data Process Safety Management Throughout 2021, we continued to invest in a proactive, ongoing improvement effort to strengthen process safety management (PSM) at all 65 global manufacturing sites. While regulatory compliance is an expectation of all our facilities, we utilize a four-tier PSM scorecard to assess our sites’ position along a PSM implementation maturity path. The scorecard reserves a top score of 4 for facilities that demonstrate a comprehensive, mature PSM program. This includes a high degree of leadership, engagement and communication, conducting and resolving process hazard analyses and maintaining employee engagement and awareness. We are committed to driving continuous improvement at all 65 global manufacturing sites. In 2021, 30.7% of our sites achieved level 2 on our PSM scorecard. Our PSM progress is reviewed on a quarterly basis. Ergonomic Interventions Sherwin-Williams continues to focus on preventing injuries through ergonomic interventions, with a goal of two interventions per year at each manufacturing site. In 2021, we implemented more than 375 ergonomic interventions.

      "FEATURE STORY Social Imprint SHERWIN-WILLIAMS 2021 SUSTAINABILITY REPORT Building on the Good 39 Nearly 30 years ago, the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) established PSM requirements for managing dangers associated with processes that use highly hazardous chemicals. The standard addresses general and construction industries and integrates technologies, procedures and management practices into the requirements. While PSM is a U.S. OSHA standard, there are several standards throughout Europe – including the Seveso Directive – as well as standards in many other countries in which Sherwin-Williams operates, such as Mexico, Brazil and South Africa. Sherwin-Williams instituted a global management standard to govern all process safety activities within the Company with a goal to help reduce risk to employees, operations and the environment in a way that extends beyond the legal standards. “We want to make sure we are meeting the legal requirements – but we also need to meet The Sherwin-Williams Company standard – which is a higher bar,” said John Vosicky, Sherwin-Williams Senior Director of Global EHS and Remediation. PSM is a program that requires participation from many groups within the organization, including: • Senior leadership to sponsor the program; • Corporate teams from digital technology, engineering operations and EHS team members to develop and manage the technical aspects; • Site leaders and staff to execute the programs; and • Operators and maintenance staff to maintain the covered equipment safely and effectively. “Senior leaders are key to making a program like PSM function within Sherwin-Williams,” explained Joseph Aleksa, Sherwin-Williams Process Safety Director. “Their understanding and support of the program give it the attention it needs to succeed.” One site that has gone beyond the legal requirements to meet the higher Sherwin-Williams standard is our resin and coatings facility in Garland, Texas. The Garland-Shiloh site continues to work toward elevating its compliance status even more. Similarly, our Singapore resin plant has achieved significant PSM continuous improvement beyond the Sherwin-Williams and in-country requirements. Our EHS teams have set tangible goals for all global process safety operations. They are planning to drive continuous improvement in PSM by 2025 and beyond. “We have executive sponsorship to get all our program sites to reach our goals, and we’re meeting with senior leaders quarterly to ensure we are continually moving forward,” Vosicky concluded.

The 88,000-square-foot site has been recordable-injury-free for more than two years. Cross-Functional EHS Ownership: Bangalore, India In addition to regular EHS training programs, employees at the Sherwin-Williams site in Bangalore, India, used several safety campaigns to ensure awareness of general health and safety measures in 2021. They were recognized for the cross-functional ownership of EHS priorities that has led to four years injury-free. The site EHS committee sought to foster its safety culture through accountability, as well as engagement activities for employees and their family members. Focus topics included hand injury prevention, National Safety Week, World Environment Day and a process safety campaign. Celebrating Our 2021 Excellence in EHS Award Winners Excellence in EHS – Most Improved: Brodziszewo, Poland Engagement is the name of the game at the Brodziszewo, Poland, site. From regular leadership tours of the facility to monthly safety committee meetings and financial bonuses for team members who submit safety suggestions, employees at the facility have made safety part of the culture. As a result, the site has gone more than three years without a recordable incident. Other improvements include solvent containment solutions, ergonomic updates and material storage changes. Most Improved EHS Site – Honorable Mention: Andover, Kansas In 2021, the Andover, Kansas, facility received Honorable Mention for the Most Improved EHS Site after consecutive years of sustained improvement. The Andover team experienced 100% employee participation in an Employee Engagement Challenge and improved in nearly every site safety metric. By targeting a packaging process that created significant ergonomic risk, the team eliminated seven repetitive steps and reduced waste.

      "Social Imprint SHERWIN-WILLIAMS 2021 SUSTAINABILITY REPORT Building on the Good 44 Elevating the Diverse Voices of Our People Our close-knit culture often functions as a supportive family. We succeed together. We learn together. We grow together. This interdependent relationship is best exemplified within our Employee Resource Groups (ERGs). These employee-led networks serve as a hub for communication, professional development and community involvement activities. ERGs are voluntary, employee-led networks organized around a shared underrepresented demographic or unique experience in the workplace. ERGs bring together employees from various groups, divisions and functional teams to foster more inclusive workplaces and create greater synergy around business objectives. In addition to building connections, employees engaged in one (or more) of the Company’s ERGs are exposed to tools and mentorship opportunities that enable them to thrive and find long-term success at Sherwin-Williams. Our ERGs are as diverse as our people and are open to everyone. ERGs represent various groups, including African American, Hispanic/Latinx, LGBTQ+, active military and veterans, multicultural and women. As membership in our more than 200 ERG chapters continues to increase, so has their impact in cultivating a shared sense of belonging among employees across our global footprint. For example, Hispanic Organization for Leadership Advancement (HOLA), our Hispanic ERG, continues to expand its reach, with increased participation from employees in the Latin American Division of The Americas Group (TAG). As part of ongoing efforts to champion and embed the Company’s ID&E actions and initiatives across our global workforce, our EMEAI (Europe, The Middle East, Africa and India) ID&E Council and Ambassador Network hosted a week of interactive programming in April 2021. The employee-led sessions incorporated the region’s most prevalent dimensions of diversity and were designed to raise awareness and promote understanding of neurodiversity, women in leadership, and mental health and wellness. Within the Asia-Pacific region, Conscious Inclusion trainings helped employees recognize their personal biases and their potential impact on creating a welcoming culture for all. In 2022, we will advance our commitment to the BOF project through formal partnerships and collaboration with underrepresented communities in Cleveland and throughout Northeast Ohio. For more information, visit buildingourfuture.com. Fostering Economic Inclusion for Underrepresented Suppliers Our efforts to foster inclusion and promote unique backgrounds, experiences and diversity of thought extend to our supply chain and partners. We are committed to providing opportunities for all qualified businesses, including minority-owned, woman-owned, LGTBQ+-owned, veteran-owned and small businesses. We are focused on strengthening partnerships to support diverse businesses and have participated in programs to increase understanding of how to apply to join our supplier network. For example, in September 2021, we partnered with the Urban League of Cleveland to host a workshop on how to do business with Sherwin-Williams. Our efforts to strengthen the underrepresented populations we serve in Northeast Ohio extends through the Company’s Building Our Future (BOF) project, which includes construction of our new global headquarters in downtown Cleveland and the new Research and Development Center in nearby Brecksville, Ohio. Since the BOF project was launched in 2020, Sherwin-Williams has gathered feedback from the City of Cleveland, City of Brecksville, community leaders, faith-based leaders and other key stakeholders on opportunities to engage and support underrepresented residents and suppliers. In September 2021, the Company announced five firms that have been selected for the minority construction management role for the BOF project. All are based in Northeast Ohio and are either woman-owned or minority-owned. Four of the five firms will also provide skilled trades employees to perform activities such as carpentry, millwork and painting. As of April 2022, we have nearly 40 minority-owned, woman-owned and Cleveland-based small businesses involved in the project, with contracts in the millions of dollars. Diverse participation is expected to grow as the project progresses.\n",

The African American Network’s (AAN) mission is to provide meaningful leadership and professional networking opportunities at all levels of the organization, while attracting, developing, retaining and progressing talent. In 2021, the AAN launched a bimonthly professional development series for employees to strengthen leadership skills, share best practices and help peers meet their professional goals. In celebration of Black History Month, the series began in February and continued through November. Yentil Rawlinson, Sherwin-Williams Vice President of Inclusion, Diversity and Equity, spoke to the value this opportunity brought to the entire organization. “One of my favorite things is that this series supports the Company goal of getting underrepresented groups into elevated roles,” she said. “It helps employees build those important skills that are necessary for the next step in their careers and is such a value-add to Sherwin-Williams.” Open to all employees, each continuous learning session garnered more than 200 participants, with the largest event having nearly 400 employees in attendance. “We saw participants from all levels – from individual contributors all the way to vice presidents,” Rawlinson explained. “We find that the demand is there for enterprise-wide events such as this, and some employees even partake as a group – so it brings people together.” Eric Easter, Sherwin-Williams Corporate IT Senior Business Analyst and Chairman of the Corporate AAN, reflected on what it was like to be a speaker during the Mastering the Behavioral Interview session. “Presenting during this series was an honor for me,” he said. There is more on the horizon for AAN and the professional development series in 2022. The group plans to build on the momentum and continue growing the events. “Our goal is to reach more people, more audiences and more learning opportunities,” Rawlinson concluded. Easter shared similar sentiments about the future. “My wish is that the tools and advice we are providing the next generation of leaders are useful in their quest for greatness,” he added. Developing a Future of Greatness with the African American Network We are proud to continue to receive third-party recognition for our efforts to foster an inclusive culture that strives to empower us all to bring our authentic selves to work. Sherwin-Williams was recognized as a Forbes® 2021 World’s Best Employer.

In 2021, Sherwin-Williams PrideWorks hosted a virtual session featuring three parents and their stories of how they support their LGBTQ+ children and their coming-out journeys. The candid conversation reinforced the importance of allyship and included resources related to understanding pronouns and guidance on how to use them to promote inclusivity. “We hosted this panel to commemorate Transgender Awareness Week and Anti-Bullying Week,” said Chris Horlacher, Sherwin-Williams Creative Director, Consumer Brands Group and President of Sherwin-Williams PrideWorks. The rising statistics for LGBTQ+ hate crimes and teen suicides drove the ERG officers to discuss how they could create an open dialogue of support within the Company. “We asked ourselves what a good way would be to communicate the importance of empathy and acceptance in the hopes of educating people,” Horlacher explained. “We wanted to try something a little different. Our parents are our strongest advocates and biggest allies – giving parents a platform to discuss and share their personal success stories in a comfortable space was the perfect teaching opportunity.” Panelists weighed in on what it meant to participate in the virtual event. “It was amazing to hear the parents’ heartfelt stories – and share our own – with such an engaged audience,” said John Gravante, Sherwin-Williams Vice President of Operations – Powder, Global Supply Chain. Similar sentiments came from Bonnie Heinsohn, Sherwin-Williams Senior Director of Marketing Communications, Consumer Brands Group. “Hearing others’ journeys gave me a bigger, better understanding of what others are going through – and that in turn makes me a better ally, a better advocate,” she said. More than 100 people attended the event, and the panelists answered questions about a variety of topics including obstacles, triumphs and the important role parents and family play in the lives of the LGBTQ+ community. “It was an uplifting and educational presentation, with truly commendable parents who shared honest and endearing perspectives,” Horlacher concluded. “This platform helped teach the importance of empathy, compassion and inclusion through the familiar eyes of mom and dad.” Sherwin-Williams PrideWorks Parent Panel Promotes Allyship\n",

Our goal was to leverage the voice of our employees and quantify our progress toward creating an inclusive culture that empowers everyone to learn, grow and achieve their career aspirations. We convened an engagement and analytics steering committee comprised of representatives from all divisions, business functions and regions to design the survey and encourage employee participation. We earned a favorable engagement score of 77%, which serves as an affirmation of our existing efforts. The 2021 survey, which was administered by a third party, established a baseline for our overall engagement score as well as associated metrics. We are committed to using the results to drive continued progress. Going forward, we will continue our regular cadence of pulse surveys and plan to conduct the global engagement survey every two years. 2021 Engagement Survey Highlights The following results from our global employee engagement survey reflect our efforts to foster an inclusive, supportive culture. • “Managers treat our employees with dignity and respect.” 90% favorable response • “Sherwin’s a safe place to work.” 85% favorable response • “I can be myself at Sherwin-Williams.” 80% favorable response • “I’d recommend Sherwin-Williams as a place to work.” 80% favorable response Talent Attraction Strategy Supports Company Growth We pride ourselves on being an employer of choice. Our talent acquisition team supports our Company’s growth strategy by identifying candidates with the experience and unique skills to contribute to our proud legacy. Beginning in 2020 and continuing throughout 2021, we pivoted from traditional recruitment methods to digital solutions, with a focus on improving the candidate experience and more efficiently filling open positions. For example, we have leveraged digital technology to create a 24-hour recruitment cycle for many retail roles, allowing candidates to apply online for an available position, record a video interview and be screened for consideration by the hiring manager within a few hours. Our commitment to create a more engaging, robust candidate experience online has enabled us to better connect with prospective employees, increase our visibility and expand our potential reach. Infusing Diversity into Our Talent Pipeline Sherwin-Williams partners with a variety of colleges and universities, including Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) and members of the Hispanic Association of Colleges and Universities (HACUs). In 2021, we participated in roundtables during the HACU annual conference and invested in four scholarships, which were distributed in early 2022. We also partner with organizations like Prospanica, the Association of Hispanic Master of Business Administrations (MBAs) and Business Professionals, as well as the National Black MBA Association, to help ensure diverse candidate slates when seeking to fill a director position or above with external talent. These partnerships and our early talent training programs play a critical role in our ability to attract diverse, innovative, passionate and qualified employees with the skills and experience needed to help us today and the desire to grow and tackle future opportunities. Rewarding Our Employees Sherwin-Williams cares about all aspects of employee well-being, including the social, emotional, physical and financial welfare of our employees.

For Sherwin-Williams, HOH offers a pipeline to accomplished, qualified candidates with unique backgrounds and experiences to fill various positions. This helps those who have served avoid unemployment/ underemployment and increases veteran representation in the U.S. workforce. Zack Melnick, Sherwin-Williams Seattle District City Manager, has made hiring veterans a priority. Inspired by a store manager whose husband was a veteran, Melnick reached out to a transition office at one of the Army bases near the Seattle district. “There are many transition programs, but this one seemed like the best opportunity for our Company – it’s pretty amazing to watch the team learn from the veterans in terms of professionalism, leadership and personal interaction,” Melnick added. “Long term, bringing individuals on board who have all those soft skills is invaluable. The perspective they have is something that can’t be replaced.” Sam Armer is a veteran who completed the 13-week Sherwin-Williams corporate fellowship and then applied for an open full-time position. Now, he is Sherwin-Williams Branch Operations Manager for the Olympia-Lacey commercial store in the Seattle District. Armer enlisted in the Army after high school and spent his early deployments in places such as Kosovo, Iraq and Afghanistan developing programs to create stability in war-torn regions. In his last deployment, Armer developed a precision targeting certification program at the Army Multi-Domain Targeting Center and achieved the Army’s first full accreditation from the National Geospatial Intelligence Agency. Transition Programs for Veterans Help Grow Our Talented Team “At the age of 18, going to a developing region and seeing extreme poverty put things into perspective for a young adult,” the veteran said. “We were helping people, and we were problem-solving. We built schools, created women’s literacy programs and worked with agricultural companies to supply seeds that would grow in the local climate.” The tools and techniques he and his team developed are still being used today. “There’s a wide spectrum of veterans from different career fields, but they all have real-world experience, where the consequences of actions are really heavy,” Armer said. “And I think veterans bring a lot of those skills – attention to detail, problem-solving skills, an understanding of processes and procedures, and management and leadership skills. Inspiring people is the same, whether you’re talking to a soldier or talking to employees about daily safety procedures.” The experiences and skills veterans like Armer bring to our Company make us proud to once again be honored by Forbes® Magazine as one of America’s Best Employers for Veterans for 2021. We recognize the responsibility to create a great place to work for those who have sacrificed so much. Sherwin-Williams will continue partnering with transition programs, including HOH, to fill the talent pipeline with veterans for other jobs in stores, offices and manufacturing and distribution facilities across the U.S.\n",

One way that Sherwin-Williams uses paint for enrichment is through the HomeWork painter training program. This five-day training series teaches under-served individuals seeking employment how to paint in a commercial environment. The program consists of both classroom time and real-world painting application practice. Those who complete the class earn a certificate under the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Renovation, Repair and Painting program. Since the HomeWork program’s launch in 2004, nearly 8,000 adult students have successfully completed it, with more than 500 classes held throughout the United States by the end of 2021. Shortly before his retirement from Sherwin-Williams in 2003, Al Blanchard, former Sherwin-Williams Director of National Accounts and Architectural Services, helped develop the program and he has remained an active force in continuing to grow its success. “The program came at a time nearly two decades ago when the painting industry was really hurting for help,” Blanchard said. “We’re proud to say we now have a 67% hiring rate, with many people finding jobs with local housing authorities, painting contractors and construction companies.” Class instructors are Sherwin-Williams retirees who teach in their spare time. “The benefit to the HomeWork students isn’t just the skills they learn, but also the teamwork, self-confidence and communication skills,” said Tom Norman, long-time HomeWork instructor. The volunteer instructor reflected on a memorable student he once had in class, whose life trajectory was changed by enrolling in the program. “He had just been released from prison and wasn’t feeling positive about his future,” Norman said. “After attending and graduating from the HomeWork program, the student had a totally different outlook on life. I learned later that he had found a job painting and that his life had been changed for the better.” “Most of the students that enroll in the HomeWork program don’t know each other at the beginning of the class; however, by the end of the five days, they develop friendships and some even find themselves working alongside each other afterward,” Norman added. “The lasting impact creates a brighter future for the students and their communities.” Blanchard reflected on what is on the horizon for the painting course in 2022 and beyond. “As we begin the 19th year of our HomeWork Painter Training program, our goal is to continue to be an industry leader,” he said. “Our key objective has always been to provide skills for the trainees to be placed in employment. We look forward to continuing to drive home this mission while creating employment opportunities in our communities for years to come.” Painting a Future of Opportunity with HomeWork Program\n",

All 61,000+ employees were invited to attend three sessions over as many days, with additional networking and Q&A opportunities available to registered SWWC members. The SWWC planning committee set meaningful goals for the event, including increasing retention and engagement of women within the organization, driving cross-divisional exposure, showcasing leadership commitment to inclusion, diversity and equity, and promoting career advancement. Topics presented during the sessions were “Bringing Your Whole Self to Work” and “Being an Ally to Women.” Keynote speakers included Kerrii Anderson, former Chief Executive Officer and President of Wendy’s International, Inc., who serves on the Sherwin-Williams Board of Directors, and Heidi Petz, who at the time was serving as the first female President of The Americas Group and in 2022 became the Company’s first female President and Chief Operating Officer. Dani Neumann, Sherwin-Williams Product Manager, Exterior Woodcare, Consumer Brands Group and 2021 SWWC President, spoke about the importance of offering this event on a global scale. “Extending these important messages to a global audience was a key piece of delivering on the purpose of the event,” she explained. “Making this a virtual event enabled us to break down geographical barriers through the use of technology.” The event drew nearly 3,000 participants globally throughout the organization, and the content was offered in 10 different languages. “Planning an event of this magnitude required many individuals to get involved and share their unique talents and skills to bring together a seamless experience,” Neumann said. Based on the positive feedback received, the event was not only a major win for the Club, but it also delivered on its purpose and goal. “I hope that anyone who attended walked away from this experience with a better understanding of how to advocate for themselves and others, with a sense of empowerment,” Neumann concluded. “Being part of the Club has empowered me to be my best self, and the members continue to inspire me with their grit, grace and ability to embrace.” SHERWIN-WILLIAMS 2021 SUSTAINABILITY REPORT Building on the Good 53 Women’s Club Hosts First-Ever Global Summit\n",

Aaron Kavanagh, Sherwin-Williams Customer Service Supervisor, Performance Coatings Group, in Dublin, Ireland, works as an emergency first responder in his spare time, and Chris Locke, Sherwin-Williams Sales Service Representative, Consumer Brands Group, in Davidson, North Carolina, is a volunteer firefighter. Both employees have served in their respective volunteer callings for nearly five years. Kavanagh clocks more than 1,000 hours of donated time with the Irish Red Cross each year. In Ireland, the Red Cross serves as a secondary emergency organization, working in tandem with the national ambulance service under the Department of Defense, often with the Red Cross’ trained first aid volunteers arriving at the scene before an ambulance does. “What many people do not realize is that a large number of hours and late nights are spent planning and coordinating behind the scenes,” said Kavanagh, who serves in many roles with the humanitarian organization, including Emergency First Aid Responder, Cardiac First Response Instructor and Branch Treasurer. He also formerly served as a Unit Officer, where he inspired more than 20 members under his leadership and was responsible for ensuring volunteers were ready and available to respond to emergency calls. Similarly, in the United States, Locke has held various positions throughout his time as a volunteer firefighter. “I have served in different roles within different departments. Currently, I am a captain at Sandy Bottom Fire and Rescue,” he said. “What initially sparked my interest was seeing the team respond to a call at a neighbor’s house. I put in an application the next week and the rest is history.” In July 2021, Locke and seven other firefighters on his team were presented with the SAVE Award by the State of North Carolina. This award is presented to firefighters who go above and beyond the call of duty to save a life; his team was specifically honored for tending to a serious mobile home fire and rescuing one of the occupants in April 2021. For Kavanagh and Locke, helping the people in their communities motivates them to continue to serve. Kavanagh recounted some of the reasons he is so passionate about his service. “The work is very rewarding,” he said. “We have seen people at their best and at their lowest – however, every call we answer helps someone, and that is why I joined the volunteer services.” Locke shared similar sentiments. “My biggest source of pride and what drives me is looking back and knowing that I have improved the lives of people in my community and that I have left it better than I found it,” he concluded. “The biggest thing is finding something you’re passionate about and using that to make a positive impact in your community.”\n",

Describe management’s role in assessing and managing climate-related risks and opportunities. Board of Directors’ Oversight Our sustainability and environmental, social and governance (ESG) framework is centered on a foundation of governance and ethics, with our governance structure designed to support broad engagement and appropriate oversight across the organization. Our Board of Directors is responsible for overseeing the assessment and management of the Company’s exposure to various risks. We have an enterprise risk management (ERM) process to identify, assess and manage the most significant risks facing us, including financial, operational, litigation, compliance, reputational and ESG risks. Management reviews significant risks with the board throughout the year, as necessary and appropriate, and conducts a formal review of the most significant risks with the board at least once per year. Our board committees assist the board with this oversight responsibility by reviewing specific risk areas. The Audit Committee’s support of the board includes overseeing the Company’s ERM process and compliance with legal and regulatory requirements, including those that may be related to environmental and climate-related requirements. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee’s support includes overseeing the Company’s key environmental (including the impacts of climate change), product stewardship, health and safety, sustainability and corporate social responsibility policies and strategies. The Compensation and Management Development Committee’s support includes overseeing the Company’s key policies and strategies regarding the attraction, retention and development of talent, including inclusion, diversity and equity initiatives, as well as our Chief Executive Officer’s annual performance evaluation, which includes a performance assessment category of ESG leadership that encompasses the development, integration and execution of ESG strategy and progress on ESG initiatives as part of the Company’s overall business strategy. Management periodically reviews our efforts and progress in these areas with the Committees, as well as the full board. Members of the Sherwin-Williams Global Sustainability team and Sustainability Steering Committee also periodically provide updates to the board regarding the Company’s key ESG strategies, policies, programs and initiatives (including those relating to climate change). Senior Management’s Role While our Board of Directors has oversight responsibility of management and various risks, the Company’s management and their teams, under the direction of our Chief Executive Officer, are responsible for managing the business and day-to-day affairs of the Company. Management is responsible for identifying, assessing and managing the Company’s exposure to various risks through the Company’s ERM process. As part of this process, we prioritize the most significant risks and assign them to senior leaders based on their respective roles within the Company to assist with the ongoing management and monitoring of those risks. Our Senior Vice President – Finance and Chief Financial Officer provides centralized management oversight of the Sherwin-Williams ERM program. In 2019, we formed a Sustainability Steering Committee to support an enterprise-wide approach to developing and overseeing our key ESG and sustainability strategies and policies and support alignment across the organization in addressing current and emerging trends, risks and opportunities. The Sustainability Steering Committee includes members of senior management and other senior leaders across the organization, and meets on a periodic basis to discuss the Company’s key ESG strategies, policies and practices, including those relating to climate change. Members of the Sustainability Steering Committee provide periodic reports to the full board and its committees. The Sustainability Steering Committee oversees and is supported by members of the Sustainability Council, which consists of subject matter experts from across the Company responsible for leading working groups that manage various ESG and sustainability initiatives, policies and programs. To focus on specific ESG- and sustainability-related initiatives, we have created working groups on an as-needed basis. In 2020, we formed the Climate and Footprint working group to address specific topics related to the Company’s climate and environmental footprint.

In line with the TCFD framework, Sherwin-Williams considers two primary types of climate risks: physical risks and transition risks. We define our time horizons in the following manner: • Short term: 0 to 2 years • Medium term: 2 to 5 years • Long term: 5 to 10 years The following risk and opportunity categories are considered in our climate-related assessments: Strategy a. Describe the climate-related risks and opportunities the organization has identified over the short, medium and long term. b. Describe the impact of climate-related risks and opportunities on the organization’s businesses, strategy and financial planning. c. Describe the resilience of the organization’s strategy, taking into consideration different climate-related scenarios, including a 2°C or lower scenario. RISK ASSESSMENT OVERVIEW Risk Categories Major Characteristics/Examples Time Horizon Physical Risk Exposure: Acute Increased frequency of severe or extreme weather events (e.g., heatwaves, drought, floods, hurricanes, wildfire, winter storms and other natural disasters) Short, medium and long term Physical Risk Exposure: Chronic Long-term shifts in physical conditions (e.g., increased average temperature, sea-level rise, melting glaciers) Long term Transition Risk Exposure: Policy Risk Risk of policy action to encourage or require low-carbon transition, water restrictions and land use restrictions in direct operations or upstream supply chain (through carbon taxes, for example) Short, medium and long term Transition Risk Exposure: Market Risk Increased costs for key suppliers to replace certain raw materials Short, medium and long term Transition Risk Exposure: Reputation Risk Increased scrutiny from investors, lenders and insurers Short, medium and long term Transition Risk Exposure: Technology Risk Possible early retirement (voluntary or forced) of existing products or technologies to mitigate climate impacts Short, medium and long term OPPORTUNITY ASSESSMENT OVERVIEW Opportunity Categories Major Characteristics/Examples Time Horizon Downstream Impact on Products and Services Protective coatings that help infrastructure withstand climate extremes and extend the life of physical assets; coatings that are used in solar and wind technologies; coatings that help reduce energy consumption, including reflective coatings; coatings that improve fuel economy; packaging coatings that reduce spoilage and wasted food Short, medium and long term Innovation Sustainability by Design initiative resulting in an enhanced portfolio of “sustainably advantaged products” Medium and long term Consumer Sentiment Increasing preference for products that have lower environmental impact, including carbon footprint Short, medium and long term Geographic and Operational Flexibility Eliminate redundancies in manufacturing capabilities; highly efficient, integrated global supply chain; strategic location of stores; ability to set up mobile stores in disaster-prone and affected areas.

      "SHERWIN-WILLIAMS 2021 SUSTAINABILITY REPORT Building on the Good 61 Appendix The Sherwin-Williams Company – Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) 2021 Report, continued Physical Risks We leveraged the expertise of S&P Global’s Trucost ESG Analytics (Trucost) to assess impacts to our facilities. Trucost analyzed the potential physical risks that may impact our operations, considering different scenarios of global warming by 2050. To evaluate the potential risks of climate change on our business, we considered three distinct climate scenarios that are commonly used in conjunction with the TCFD framework: SCENARIO REPRESENTATIVE CONCENTRATION PATHWAY (RCP) DESCRIPTION High Climate Change Scenario RCP 8.5 Continuation of business as usual with emissions worldwide at current rates. This scenario is expected to result in warming in excess of 4°C by 2100. Moderate Climate Change Scenario RCP 6.5 Strong mitigation actions to reduce emissions worldwide to half of current levels by 2080. This scenario is more likely than not to result in warming in excess of 2°C by 2100. Low Climate Change Scenario RCP 2.6 Aggressive mitigation actions to halve emissions worldwide by 2050. This scenario is likely to result in warming of less than 2°C by 2100. We evaluated these risks under all three scenarios. Our environmental footprint reduction goals were based on a global warming scenario of less than 2°C, in alignment with the use of science-based targets. For additional climate-related risk information beyond what is included in this document, see the risk factor discussion related to adverse weather conditions and natural disasters in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021 (Form 10-K). Our environmental footprint reduction goals for 2030, versus a 2019 baseline, are as follows: 1. Reduce absolute Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions by 30% by 2030; 2. Increase electricity from renewable sources to 50% of total electricity usage by 2030; 3. Increase operational energy efficiency by 20% by 2030; and 4. Reduce waste disposal intensity by 25% by 2030. We believe we can use the experience gained from pursuing these 2030 targets to propel us toward more ambitious goals for 2050 and beyond. As for physical risks, the third-party assessment of our more than 5,000 manufacturing, retail, laboratory, warehouse and blending facilities determined that, in the aggregate, we are generally at low risk for adverse impacts resulting from wildfire, coldwave, heatwave, flood, sea level rise and hurricanes. The assessment identified water stress as a moderate to high physical risk at some of our locations. However, upon further analysis, many of the Sherwin-Williams sites in the highest water stress risk areas are distribution warehouses and offices, where water use is limited (employee-related uses). We believe only a modest number of our manufacturing sites are in water-stressed areas, and we are working with these sites to assist in mitigating and monitoring water stress risk effectively. RISK TYPE: Acute Physical TIME HORIZON: Short, medium and long term DESCRIPTION: As noted in the introduction to this disclosure, Sherwin-Williams has a global presence and an integrated network of manufacturing, distribution and sales locations. As our Company grows and we continue expanding our geographic footprint, we may encounter more extremes in water availability and with local climates. Source: TCFD and Trucost\n",
      "SHERWIN-WILLIAMS 2021 SUSTAINABILITY REPORT Building on the Good 62 Appendix The Sherwin-Williams Company – Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) 2021 Report, continued Transition Risks RISK TYPE: Public Policy TIME HORIZON: Short, medium and long term DESCRIPTION: We look at both current and emerging regulations in the markets where we operate and evaluate the potential impact of proposed rules, and other regulatory frameworks, on our business. Increased global focus on climate change may result in the imposition of new or additional regulations or requirements applicable to, and increased financial risks for, our business and industry. The outcome of new legislation or regulation in the U.S. and other jurisdictions in which we operate may result in new or additional requirements, including to fund energy efficiency activities or renewable energy use, and fees or restrictions on certain activities or materials. Compliance with these climate change initiatives may also result in additional costs to us, including, among other things, increased production costs, additional taxes, additional investments in renewable energy use and other initiatives, reduced emission allowances or additional restrictions on production or operations. As environmental footprinting at the product level becomes increasingly important, the possibility of carbon limits for products may occur. We have already seen examples of this for other building materials in various regions around the world. Although our innovation and R&D efforts, combined with our life cycle assessment program, are expected to assist in mitigating the adverse impact of such potential carbon limits, certain product types or product lines could be affected, requiring substantial product reformulations. Sherwin-Williams participates in various regional and industry trade associations such as the American Coatings Association (ACA); the European Council of the Paint, Printing Ink and Artists’ Colours Industry (CEPE); the Retail Industry Leaders Association (RILA); the National Association of Manufacturers (NAM); and groups such as the U.S. Green Building Council. This active involvement demonstrates our commitment to collaborate and share ideas within the industry and other groups about the connection points between public policy and our focus on technical innovation. This engagement also informs the development of our strategies for addressing current and emerging trends, risks and opportunities and complying with applicable laws and regulations relating to the environment and climate change. Generally, the coatings industry is evolving from solvent-based formulations to water-based formulations. This evolution is being driven by customer preference and regulatory changes. However, it is also increasing the demand on local fresh water sources, which could escalate into water deficiencies or shortages in some areas. Although not always possible, we attempt to locate manufacturing in areas with ample water supply. From time to time, adverse weather conditions and natural disasters have had or may have an adverse effect on our sales, manufacture and distribution of our products. In the event adverse weather conditions or a natural disaster causes considerable damage to any one or more of our principal manufacturing or distribution facilities, we may not be able to manufacture the products needed to meet customer demand, which could have an adverse effect on our sales. The impact of these risks to our suppliers also have had or may have an adverse effect on our sales, manufacture and distribution of certain of our products. During 2021, Winter Storm Uri and Hurricane Ida caused severe damage to certain of our suppliers’ facilities in Texas and Louisiana, respectively. These natural disasters and their impacts to certain of our suppliers resulted in unprecedented industry-wide supply chain disruptions, increased raw material and other costs, and significantly hindered our ability to manufacture the products needed to fully meet customer demand. We discussed these natural disasters and their adverse impacts to our business in our disclosures throughout the year. In the event of adverse weather conditions and natural disasters, we focus on responding to and mitigating the impacts quickly, including, but not limited to, redistributing resources within our network (people, materials, etc.) and/or providing temporary solutions (opening mobile stores in impacted areas, for example). RISK TYPE: Chronic Physical TIME HORIZON: Long term DESCRIPTION: Severe weather events have the potential to disrupt operations at manufacturing, distribution and sales locations within certain regions. Our Global Supply Chain (GSC) consists of a highly efficient manufacturing and distribution system for paint, coatings and related products. GSC is integrated in such a way that the risk created by a particular location being forced out of service may be mitigated, including by shifting production to other locations, if necessary. If climate risks continue to increase, there is the potential for further disruption to more of our locations simultaneously, and for more severe consequences from each disruption. We will continue to focus on these physical risks for strategic planning purposes, with an emphasis on water stress as a predominant long-term risk.\n",
      "SHERWIN-WILLIAMS 2021 SUSTAINABILITY REPORT Building on the Good 63 Appendix RISK TYPE: Market TIME HORIZON: Short, medium and long term DESCRIPTION: We believe our primary climate-related market risks are the potential for increased costs and insufficient availability of the raw materials we need to produce our products. As our Company grows and we continue expanding our geographic footprint, we may encounter more extremes in water availability. Generally, as the coatings industry is evolving from solvent-based formulations to water-based formulations, there may be an increasing demand on local fresh water sources. Going forward, we will continue to monitor this closely so that we can fine-tune our consideration of the various assumptions and factors that could impact our view of climate-related market risk. In addition, our suppliers may have exposure to climate-related risks that may disrupt our ability to acquire raw materials or result in higher prices due to shortages. Furthermore, risks of shifting consumer behavior and preferences are relevant to our business. Where possible, we strive to find ways to respond to these risks, trends and our customers’ needs and requests with respect to the premium products, quality and service that they have come to expect from us, including by taking the opportunity to expand our portfolio of “sustainably advantaged products,” as further described below. In a growing number of situations, sustainability is considered a market attribute for products both at the sales and formulator levels. As end users continue to become more climate-conscious, it is important for us to keep pace with those demands. Consumers also increasingly desire products with such sustainability or “green” attributes, which can be based on their ingredients, how they are formulated and how they are used. For example, the percentage of lower-VOC or no-VOC product alternatives in our portfolio has continued to grow in recent years. RISK TYPE: Reputation TIME HORIZON: Short, medium and long term DESCRIPTION: We are mindful of our stakeholders’ perceptions of us. We work hard to maintain our reputation as an industry leader and continue to be recognized for our efforts and progress on our sustainability and ESG initiatives. The heightened focus on climate change has created opportunities to review our sustainability and ESG strategies and practices. Failure to reduce the Company’s emissions and environmental impact or to respond to changes in consumer behaviors and preferences may result in reduced demand for our products and services. We partner and collaborate with non-governmental organizations, customers, suppliers and regulators to foster open lines of communication and aid us in being responsive to stakeholder interests. However, we are aware that maintaining and building on our initiatives is an important short-, medium- and long-term responsibility because even small missteps have the potential to create reputation risk for our business. RISK TYPE: Technology TIME HORIZON: Medium and long term DESCRIPTION: Evaluation of technology is incorporated into our business operations. When selecting equipment, energy efficiency is often considered as part of the selection process. In addition, sustainability attributes, including environmental footprint, have been built into certain of our research and development (R&D) processes across much of the business to consider potential climate impacts of new raw materials, formulation technologies and/or product performance. To help further our focus on incorporating sustainability attributes into our approach to technology and product development, in 2021, we implemented our Sustainability by Design program across the enterprise. This program embeds life cycle thinking into early stages of these processes and better enables us to expand our portfolio of “sustainably advantaged products.” We define “sustainably advantaged products” as those products that achieve a level of third-party green chemistry, ecolabel or similar recognition, or can be shown to be more sustainable than what is currently the norm for the industry. This initiative is a signature effort in our five-stage Stage-Gate process to formally incorporate sustainability attributes within our innovation and product development processes. From initial concept through commercialization, we strive to identify ways to make our products more sustainable and better performing by evaluating chemical formulations, product performance, manufacturing processes, health and safety considerations and product packaging, among other areas. In 2021, we defined five “Sustainability Attributes” for product innovation and development – Air Quality, Formula Stewardship, Resource Conservation, Circularity and Performance.

      "SHERWIN-WILLIAMS 2021 SUSTAINABILITY REPORT Building on the Good 64 Appendix The Sherwin-Williams Company – Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) 2021 Report, continued • Sustainability by Design: Through this initiative, we consider sustainability attributes in innovation and product development processes within our five-stage Stage-Gate process. From initial concept through commercialization, we identify ways to make our products more sustainable and better performing by evaluating chemical formulations, product performance, manufacturing processes, health and safety considerations and product packaging, among other areas. In 2021, we defined five “Sustainability Attributes” of focus for product innovation and development – Air Quality, Formula Stewardship, Resource Conservation, Circularity and Performance. • “Sustainably Advantaged Products”: As we define it, the term “sustainably advantaged product” means a product that achieves a level of third-party green chemistry, ecolabel or similar recognition, or can be shown to be more sustainable than what is currently the norm for the industry. We are pursuing growth opportunities by developing new products and services to further preserve existing assets and create products designed to facilitate energy savings. Innovations in coatings technology have led to coatings that require less energy to apply and cure, including: • Coatings that once required high-temperature bake cycles in the past can now cure at room temperatures because of innovative technology. These coatings reduce energy requirements by eliminating the need for high-temperature bake cycles. • The development of high-transfer-efficiency powder coatings not only reduces spray time and the energy associated with the spray application process, but also reduces product loss, which further reduces energy use and preserves natural resources. • Heat- and sun-reflective roof coatings and infrared-reflecting concrete coatings reduce the urban heat island effect and can reduce cooling needs in warmer climates. • Powder coatings and other types of coating systems that deliver high performance in just one layer rather than competing coatings that may require multiple layers, which requires more energy and material to achieve similar performance. Opportunities OPPORTUNITY TYPE: Downstream Impact on Products and Services TIME HORIZON: Short term DESCRIPTION: The risks and impacts of climate change, and global efforts to combat climate change, have the potential to create opportunities for our business. For example, extreme weather conditions can drive demand for our protective coatings, if assets are destroyed or need repair as a result. Our coatings are used in a wide variety of asset preservation applications – extending the useful life of bridges, buildings, heavy equipment, appliances, vehicles and boats. Without our coatings, these assets may have a shorter life span and require earlier disposal and replacement with new assets that utilize additional energy and natural resources in their production. As an example, consider the cost of carbon for manufacturing and installing a steel structure such as a bridge. The structure’s life expectancy would be severely limited if installed without corrosion protection or using inadequate coating technologies. Using our products extends the life of the bridge, reducing the need to replace it following unabated weathering, corrosion or neglect. Replacement of any structure prematurely may create an increased GHG burden on the Earth, its atmosphere and society. We believe our ability to provide products that are designed to withstand extreme weather events and extend product life span enables us to contribute to carbon and waste reduction in meaningful ways all around the world. In addition, our coatings help enable assets such as solar panels, wind turbines and marine craft to continue to operate in an efficient manner. We also make reflective coatings that reduce energy consumption and packaging coatings that reduce spoilage and food or beverage waste. OPPORTUNITY TYPE: Innovation TIME HORIZON: Medium and long term DESCRIPTION: Given the increasing interest in low-carbon products, several projects are underway to help reduce carbon in products we manufacture. In early 2019, Sherwin-Williams became the first company in our industry to publish an externally validated strategy for reducing the carbon footprints of several key products, and we have specifically committed to lowering the carbon footprint of 10 of our best-selling product lines. As such, carbon performance is a key attribute that is considered early in the R&D process. In 2021, we formally introduced our Sustainability by Design initiative, committed to implementing it across the enterprise and determined our baseline of “sustainably advantaged products.”\n",
      "SHERWIN-WILLIAMS 2021 SUSTAINABILITY REPORT Building on the Good 65 Appendix OPPORTUNITY TYPE: Consumer Sentiment TIME HORIZON: Short, medium and long term DESCRIPTION: Many consumers and markets are demonstrating an increasing preference for products that have lower environmental impact, including a lower carbon footprint. We believe our position to meet those needs is strengthened by our sustainability initiatives and the transparency of our actions. In addition, we offer products that are specifically designed to better protect the surfaces they cover, which may result in reduced consumption. Through the preservation of their existing assets and our products designed to facilitate energy savings, customers increasingly recognize the beneficial attributes of Sherwin-Williams products. We believe we have a good understanding of the footprints of our products because we have invested in industry-leading capabilities in life cycle assessment (LCA) and environmental product declarations (EPDs). Many of these LCAs have been peer-reviewed, published as EPDs and are publicly available. We have EPDs for hundreds of products. To help us optimize our product footprint, we created our Sustainability by Design program and determined our baseline of “sustainably advantaged products.” Sustainability by Design is a signature effort in our five-stage Stage-Gate process to formally incorporate sustainability attributes such as life cycle thinking within our innovation and product development processes. This program enables us to evolve our products and processes to deliver and grow our “sustainably advantaged products” offering. Opportunity Type: Geographic Flexibility Time Horizon: Short, medium and long term Description: Our Global Supply Chain (GSC) consists of a highly efficient manufacturing and distribution network for paint, coatings and related products. GSC is integrated in such a way that the risk created by the potential loss of operations within a location or region is mitigated. Production can be shifted to other locations if necessary. As for the geographic reach of our store locations, we have historically located our stores in promising markets that may have exposure to physical risks from climate change. We believe that our experience operating in these environments has made us a reliable and trusted neighbor in these communities that can be counted on to deliver product to expediently assist rebuilding and recovery efforts. Although severe weather events in these areas may adversely impact our own operations, cause disruptions and reduce the demand for our products, such circumstances can be an opportunity to serve the needs of our customers in these high-growth regions. In addition, our store location density and mobile platform have helped enable us to initiate sales quickly following certain natural disasters, even if stores in the region were negatively impacted by a severe weather event.

Our board committees, with each composed entirely of independent directors, assist with this oversight responsibility by reviewing specific risk areas, including relating to the environment and the impacts of climate change and certain other ESG and sustainability risks, and making regular reports to the board. Sherwin-Williams faces risks, uncertainties and other factors that could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, cash flow, liquidity or financial condition. These include such things as political instability, higher tariffs and adverse weather conditions, including wildfire, coldwave, heatwave, flood, sea level rise, hurricanes and other natural disasters. In addition, regulations related to climate change may negatively impact us or our suppliers in terms of availability and cost of raw materials, as well as sources and supply of energy. Since 2005, we have been voluntarily reporting to CDP. For additional climate-related risk information beyond what is included in this document, see the climate-related risks discussion in our Form 10-K. In 2021 and into early 2022, we retained the services of a third-party consultant to help us further assess the risks and opportunities associated with climate change and to help us prepare for this report and related disclosures.

      "SHERWIN-WILLIAMS 2021 SUSTAINABILITY REPORT Building on the Good 66 Appendix The Sherwin-Williams Company – Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) 2021 Report, continued How We Integrate Climate-related Risks into the Organization’s Overall Risk Management Our Board of Directors is responsible for overseeing the assessment and management of the Company’s exposure to various risks. We have an ERM process to identify, assess and manage the most significant risks facing us, including financial, operational, litigation, compliance, reputational and ESG risks. Management reviews significant risks with the board throughout the year, as necessary and appropriate, and conducts a formal review of the most significant risks with the board at least once per year. Our board committees assist the board with this oversight responsibility by reviewing specific risk areas. The Audit Committee’s support of the board includes overseeing the Company’s ERM process and compliance with legal and regulatory requirements, including those relating to environmental and climate-related risks. Management periodically reviews our efforts and progress in these areas with the Committees, as well as the full board. Management is responsible for identifying, assessing and managing the Company’s exposure to various risks through the Company’s ERM process. As part of this process, we prioritize the most significant risks and assign them to senior leaders based on their respective roles within the Company to assist with the ongoing management and monitoring of those risks. Our Senior Vice President – Finance and Chief Financial Officer provides centralized oversight of the Sherwin-Williams ERM program. In 2019, we formed a Sustainability Steering Committee to support an enterprise-wide approach to developing and overseeing our key ESG and sustainability strategies and policies and support alignment across the organization in addressing current and emerging trends, risks and opportunities. The Sustainability Steering Committee includes members of senior management and other senior leaders across the organization and meets on a periodic basis to discuss the Company’s key ESG strategies, policies and practices, including those relating to climate change. Members of the Sustainability Steering Committee provide periodic reports to the full board and its committees. The Sustainability Steering Committee oversees and is supported by members of the Sustainability Council, which consists of subject matter experts from across the Company responsible for leading working groups that manage various ESG and sustainability initiatives, policies and programs. To focus on specific ESG- and sustainability-related initiatives, we have created working groups on an as-needed basis. In 2020, we formed the Climate and Footprint working group to address specific topics related to the Company’s climate and environmental footprint. comprehensive, data-driven assessment that evaluated a wide range of physical and transition risks at the enterprise, business unit, product and individual location level. The initial results from that assessment were used to define the risks and opportunities contained in the Strategy section of this TCFD report. How We Manage Climate-related Risks Sherwin-Williams is actively working to mitigate climate-related risks, including through our Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG emissions reduction goals. In 2021, we announced 2030 environmental footprint goals against a 2019 baseline. The 2030 environmental footprint goals are as follows: • Reduce absolute Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions by 30% by 2030 • Increase electricity from renewable sources to 50% of total electricity usage by 2030 • Increase operational energy efficiency by 20% by 2030 • Reduce waste disposal intensity by 25% by 2030 We have a robust life cycle assessment (LCA) program, with many of our LCAs peer-reviewed and published as Environmental Product Declarations (EPDs) and publicly available. We have EPDs for hundreds of products. The data from our LCAs and EPDs show that the raw materials in our coating products account for a majority of our total carbon footprint from “cradle to grave” and that raw materials are the largest driver of our Scope 3 emissions. Other efforts to manage and mitigate our climate-related risks include our Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG emissions reduction goals and our Sustainability by Design initiative. We are also actively working with several key suppliers and customers on carbon footprint reduction initiatives. On an ongoing basis, we bring in key suppliers for sustainability discussions with senior leaders in the Company. These meetings often include presentations on topics or technical solutions specific to product carbon footprints. This has been taking place since 2018 and provides the opportunity to discuss with leadership the technical possibilities from key suppliers. It is also an opportunity for us to share our related sustainability expectations and goals. When we are addressing customer needs, sustainability is a potentially important market attribute for products both at the sales and formulator levels. As a result, customers increasingly regard Sherwin-Williams products as logical choices to help protect and preserve existing assets.\n",

Disclose the metrics used by the organization to assess climate-related risks and opportunities in line with its strategy and risk management process. b. Disclose Scope 1, Scope 2, and, if appropriate, Scope 3 greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, and the related risks. c. Describe the targets used by the organization to manage climate-related risks and opportunities and performance against targets. Metrics We assess climate-related risks and opportunities using the following metrics: • Scope 1 (Direct CO2) Emissions (metric tons CO2e) • Scope 2 (Indirect CO2) Emissions (metric tons CO2e) • Scope 3 Emissions (metric tons CO2e) • Total Energy Performance (Intensity) (gigajoules per metric ton of production) • Total Energy Consumption (million gigajoules) 2021 Scope 1, 2 and 3 GHG Emissions • Scope 1 (Direct CO2) Emissions: 354,397 metric tons CO2e • Scope 2 (Indirect CO2) Emissions: 266,869 metric tons CO2e • Scope 3 Emissions: To be disclosed in our 2021 CDP report later this year For insight on our analysis of climate-related risks, see the Strategy section of this TCFD report. Targets In 2021, we aligned our climate strategy to reflect a science-based targets approach influenced by the Paris Agreement and its goal to limit global warming to well below 2.0 degrees Celsius. Our 2030 goal of reducing our absolute Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions by 30% compared with a 2019 baseline is predicated on this objective. We determined that tracking and weighing our absolute Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions, rather than setting an intensity-based goal, aligned best with the global need for mitigating the physical amount of GHG emitted into the atmosphere over time. To review our current emissions data, see the Environmental Footprint section in our 2021 Sustainability Report and our 2021 Investor ESG Summary.\n",

The world is in a different place than it was in 2010. With the effects of a global pandemic still being felt, along with the ramifications of a war that’s affecting citizens worldwide, we are in uncharted territory. Combined with the ever-growing crises of the climate emergency, nature loss and mounting inequality, it is up to all of us to make dedicated and aggressive efforts to positively impact our future. 4 Appendix Introduction Equity & Wellbeing Responsible Sourcing Transparency & Accountability Climate & Planetary Health Sustainable Solutions Our ESG+ Commitment\n",
      "But what does that look like? What does that mean? One of IFF’s three commitments is to question everything. That has never been a stronger calling card than it is today. We titled this report “Transforming Our World,” because the Company spent 2021 focusing on transformation in three very real ways. This report, the first to share our collective performance and outcomes post-merger, charts that growth. First, we combined the legacy talents and experiences of IFF and N&B so that our new company leverages a stronger competitive advantage, putting us in a better position to win in the marketplace and to serve all of our stakeholders. Second, it reflects how we transform raw materials into leading ingredient solutions that, as preferred partners, we supply to our customers every day. And lastly, but just as importantly, it speaks to the sustainable development transformation that is needed to ensure we all live within planetary boundaries for the long-term. Even though this might be the first time IFF is reporting under the “ESG” banner, we have long led in this space, having championed the 10 principles of the U.N. Global Compact since 2015 and aligned with the U.N. Sustainable Development Goals where we believe can make the most significant contribution. The four strategic pillars laid out in our Do More Good Plan – sustainable solutions, climate & planetary health, equity & wellbeing and transparency & accountability – provide a framework for the ways we are contributing to sustainable development and illustrate how we are managing our impact on the economy, environment and people. SUSTAINABLE SOLUTIONS The “+” in our ESG+ is all about our commitment to deliver solutions to our customers so they can succeed, specifically by providing them with the technology and innovation that supports them in reaching their own ESG goals. We see this as a clear path forward, and by 2030 we intend for all innovations within our pipeline to have a value proposition that supports sustainable development, holistically. We’re already well on our way to making that a reality. In 2021, we saw IFF texturants and flavorings enable and accelerate a wider adoption of plant-based proteins. Our grain enzymes enable higher biofuel yields in customer production processes and our home care enzymes have enabled the everyday consumer to save energy (and money) by washing dishes and clothes using colder temperatures. Through the launch of the Science of Wellness™ program, we are delivering scent solutions to customers that support science-based consumer wellbeing, including cognitive, emotional and physical health. Additionally, we are one of the world’s largest 5 Appendix Introduction Equity & Wellbeing Responsible Sourcing Transparency & Accountability Climate & Planetary Health Sustainable Solutions Our ESG+ Commitment\n",

Our SeaGel® capsule is a plant-based technology that enables a higher-production rate and better capsule yield, producing less waste than traditional gelatin alternatives. ENVIRONMENTAL: CLIMATE & PLANETARY HEALTH A key component of our Do More Good Plan is our commitment to safeguard the climate and strengthen planetary health. We were pleased to be named for the first time in 2021 to CDP’s Triple A List for corporate transparency and action on climate change, water stewardship and deforestation, and to again be named a CDP Supplier Engagement Leader. But we know there is more work to do. Our GHG emissions baseline increased by a factor of eight times following the merger with N&B, so we are addressing this challenge by doubling down on dedicated energy and water efficiency programs, as well as expanding our use of renewable energy to lighten the footprint of our manufacturing sites. To track our progress in these areas, we announced our plans to reduce absolute GHG emissions by 50% below 2021 levels by 2030 and to achieve net zero GHG emissions by 2040. We can only accomplish these goals with the help of our employees, so we have expanded our Green Teams, employee-led groups passionate about sustainability, to all IFF operations facilities and launched a Green Team onboarding and training program to support those heritage N&B sites that are new to the program. You can’t have good planetary health without responsible sourcing and for that, we are committed to supporting biodiversity and promoting regenerative ecosystems across our supply chain. By 2030, our target is to achieve zero deforestation for our strategic raw material supply chains, beginning with palm, soy and wood. SOCIAL: EQUITY & WELLBEING Even with IFF’s established reputation in the industry, it was the passion of the people that truly attracted me to this great company as CEO. Now, being inside these walls, it’s clear that the equity and wellbeing of employees is core to the corporate fabric. Creating a better world is intrinsically connected to how employees and our supply chain partners can thrive under the IFF umbrella. With COVID still present globally we’ve worked to institute the digital workplace for our employee base so non-essential IFFers have the ability to work from home safely, aligned with our Future of Work program while maintaining productivity, as well as our connections with each other. 6 Appendix Introduction Equity & Wellbeing Responsible Sourcing Transparency & Accountability Climate & Planetary Health Sustainable Solutions Our ESG+ Commitment\n",
      "Even with our demonstrated track record of creating safe environments where our people can be their authentic selves, whether in-person or virtually, we aim to do more. Our new, ambitious goals for diversity, equity & inclusion call for us to achieve 50% women at all organizational levels and 40% people of color in management roles in the U.S. by 2030. Tied to executive compensation, these and other ESG metrics are designed to meet the expectations of employees and our other stakeholders. We cannot overemphasize that the safety of our people is crucial. Following significant integration milestones that harmonized our Environment, Health & Safety (EHS) program in 2021, we achieved improved trends in our safety metrics for the year. This is a step forward that positively positions us to continuously work toward an incident-free workplace and to achieve our goal of world-class safety performance. Our commitment to people has always extended to the communities where we operate as well. Through the engagement and outreach initiatives of our responsible sourcing program, we are promoting human rights and supporting farmers’ livelihoods to ensure prosperous and equitable value chains. In Madagascar, 2021 saw us continuing to work with our vanilla farmers’ association on trainings for sustainable agricultural practices that help improve cultivation and preserve ecosystems, while supporting sustainable incomes for vanilla farmers for the long term. GOVERNANCE: TRANSPARENCY & ACCOUNTABILITY Over these past few years, from the pandemic to natural disasters, we’ve seen unprecedented socio-political, health and macro-economic challenges that affect the lives of our people, our communities and our operations. However, with transparency and accountability, we’ve been able to persevere in the face of the unexpected. We are strengthening our annual disclosures and data metrics every year in line with stakeholder expectations, and we are taking steps to hold ourselves accountable to continuous performance improvement by expanding oversight for ESG governance at the Board of Directors level. We’re not perfect but we are grounded in our commitment to corporate governance and to being the partner for essential solutions our customers expect by supplying safe, high-quality and responsible products and solutions. 7 Appendix Introduction Equity & Wellbeing Responsible Sourcing Transparency & Accountability Climate & Planetary Health Sustainable Solutions Our ESG+ Commitment\n",

      "MATERIALITY In 2021, IFF conducted a full strategic materiality assessment to account for our changing business following the merger with N&B. The scope of the materiality assessment covered all IFF businesses, including legacy IFF business segments as well as new segments post-merger. Prior to this, the last full materiality assessment we had conducted was in 2014, with a refresh in 2019 following our acquisition of Frutarom. By following an evidence-based, objective process in collaboration with an independent third party, we identified priority focus areas, revealed risks and opportunities, and prioritized the ESG topics that matter most to our company and our stakeholders. The assessment began with a detailed process of research and benchmarking to understand the universe of potentially material topics from a wide array of internal and external sources. This included creating a high-level value chain map summarizing our business inputs and outputs and facilitating a workshop with a representative set of cross-functional senior managers and subject matter experts to discuss IFF’s potential ESG impacts, risks, and opportunities across our value chain. Next, our internal stakeholder engagement process included an employee survey and interviews with our Executive Committee (including our CEO), as well as representatives from our Board of Directors. External engagement channels included interviews with a robust and representative set of suppliers, investors, NGOs, and customers from all four of our divisions. To bring an added layer of data-driven and real-time insights to this assessment, we also utilized an artificial intelligence platform that scanned millions of data points from public sources, including SEC filings, sustainability reports, annual financial reports, ESG-related regulatory initiatives, news articles, and social media posts. The third phase of the materiality assessment, topic prioritization, included a detailed synthesis of all research and inputs, as well as a final workshop with IFF senior managers and leaders to confirm and validate the results. Following the final workshop, the results were presented to, and approved by, the Executive Committee and the Board of Directors, the highest level of responsibility for validating the final topics. In the context of ESG management, materiality6 is an evidence-based, objective prioritization process to identify and validate the most important issues, risks, and opportunities for a company and its internal and external stakeholders, serving as the foundation for the long-term success of the company’s ESG+ strategy. 6.

      "Results Key Insights The results of our 2021 materiality exercise are visually presented on page 18 in a matrix that reflects the priorities of IFF’s internal (x axis) and external (y axis) stakeholders. A total of 19 topics – representing a snapshot in time – were identified from across four focus areas (Product, Environmental, Social, and Governance), which, in turn, align with the four pillars of our Do More Good PlanTM (Sustainable Solutions, Climate & Planetary Health, Equity & Wellbeing, and Transparency & Accountability, respectively). We aim to address all 19 material topics throughout this report in accordance with the guidelines of the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) and the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB). While each can impact our business, three bands of priority level were identified as part of the analysis, with “Tier 1” reflecting the nine topics we most closely manage, set goals against, and provide robust discussion about in our ESG disclosures. (While these tiers help guide our management approaches and resource allocations, they do not necessarily equate to the extent of strategy or action within IFF to address an issue.) •\t Responsible sourcing rose in importance (as compared to our most recent materiality refresh) to become IFF’s most material issue, with both climate change and sustainable product solutions being key drivers of this shift. – Potential changes to our supply chain following the N&B merger were noted as warranting additional focus on our responsible sourcing practices, including the importance of traceability and transparency. •\t Stakeholders prioritized product-related topics, underscoring the importance of ESG imperatives related to IFF’s R&D pipeline and innovation capabilities. – Innovation & Sustainable Product Solutions was added to focus on the processes, practices, and products that eliminate negative environmental or social impacts while realizing positive benefits for IFF and our stakeholders. – While stakeholders noted IFF’s increased capabilities because of the N&B merger, they also noted the increased challenges that the merger may present to topics such as Responsible Sourcing, Climate Change, Water, and Energy. •\t Other topics, including Community Engagement & Philanthropy, Human Rights and Information Security remained foundational to IFF’s business, but were not considered to be high-risk, based on IFF’s current performance.

      "U.N. SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOALS IFF’s Do More Good Plan is in alignment with the 17 United Nations (U.N.) Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), which represent a common framework through which the public and private sectors can work together to identify transformational opportunities to achieve the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. The SDGs create a pathway for moving beyond incremental progress toward meaningful transformative change that has the potential to create value, drive resilience, and support sustainable long-term growth. In 2021, IFF participated in the SDG Ambition Accelerator, a six-month initiative during the first half of 2021 led by the U.N. Global Compact (UNGC) and Network USA in partnership with SAP, Accenture, and 3M. The objective of the program was to support participating member companies in setting ambitious corporate targets to accelerate the integration of the 17 SDGs into core business management practices. During the program, we assessed our current performance, identified risk areas, discovered new opportunities across our business divisions, and used insights from the analysis and collaboration with participating peer companies to inform both our materiality assessment and ultimately, our Do More Good Plan.

Other examples of sustainable solutions include grain enzymes that enable higher yields of biofuels in our customers’ production processes, and laundry enzymes that enable consumers to save energy by washing their clothes at lower temperatures without sacrificing performance. Consumer health and wellness priorities can be enabled through dietary supplements; probiotics that support the microbiome; modulation ingredients that allow for reductions of salt, sugar, and fat; and enzymes that allow for increased levels of fiber (e.g., in bread and dairy products). Our Science of Wellness™ program delivers scent solutions that support cognitive, emotional, and physical health. The potential scale of these solutions is huge, and reflective of the types of transformational sustainable development changes that will be needed to ensure that 9+ billion people can live well, within planetary resource boundaries by 2050. The Paris Agreement’s climate mitigation targets, as well as national and regional climate priorities, also inform innovations from our business segments. Among the most important tools we use to drive innovative sustainable solutions are Where we believe our products can make one of the biggest differences from a sustainability perspective is through their positive life cycle impacts during the use phase. The scale of benefits we can enable for our customers (IFF’s “handprint”) far outweighs IFF’s manufacturing and operational “footprint” (see figure). In this way, we are not only contributing to the U.N. SDGs at a global scale, but we are also helping our customers reach their goals as they relate to the environment, circular economy, and health and wellness. Our extensive sustainable innovation portfolio provides benefits across a large spectrum of applications and addresses global food, nutrition, and agriculture objectives. For example, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) estimates that livestock globally contribute 14.5% of all human induced GHG emissions. Through our texturants and flavorings, we can enable and accelerate the wider adoption of plant-based alternatives with a lower environmental footprint. At the same time, our feed enzymes and probiotic solutions help allow for more sustainable livestock production that not only addresses climate concerns but also animal welfare through the reduced need for antibiotics. Our phytase enzyme solutions increase yields, reduce or eliminate the need for inorganic phosphorus, and improve circular design and life cycle assessment. Our increased and more diverse portfolio of solutions also presents various new challenges, such as effectively managing resources; prioritizing the many innovation pathways we can pursue across our R&D portfolio; and selectively applying our Sustainability, Regulatory, and Public Affairs resources to the projects with the clearest potential value proposition. Our expanded capabilities also bring with them heightened customer expectations and requirements for understanding the ESG performance and attributes of our products. To respond most effectively, we must ensure we have access to the right data for the combined company, the consolidation of which has been a significant undertaking during our 2021 integration process. Finally, we must not only consider regulatory restrictions or opportunities that may impact our innovation pipeline, but also anticipate changes to these boundary conditions, while helping regulators and other stakeholders keep up with the pace of innovation. For example, we engage in opportunities to educate stakeholders on both the benefits and the safety of our products, including shaping approval pathways for novel products made with new technologies, such as modern biotechnology.

      "Circular Design IFF has a longstanding commitment to driving circular design principles to promote sustainable innovation. Unlike traditional linear design models, circular design supports a restorative, regenerative economy and moves away from the unsustainable “take- make-dispose” approach. Concretely, we promote circularity by replacing fossil fuel derived materials with renewable and biodegradable versions in our production. In manufacturing, we champion circular design through biotechnology and green chemistry. This includes ensuring energy and resource efficiency, expanding our use of renewable energy, and focusing on zero waste, where possible. We also address the challenge of waste through upcycling – a circular design principle of creating scalable, sustainable, and value-added solutions by reusing products from typically discarded side streams. 32 Appendix Equity & Wellbeing Responsible Sourcing Transparency & Accountability Climate & Planetary Health Sustainable Solutions Our ESG+ Commitment Introduction\n",
      "Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) LCA is a quantitative assessment of environmental impacts across the life cycle of a product or service. The scope typically involves all stages of the life cycle, from raw material acquisition until the product leaves the production factory (cradle-to-gate) and ideally also includes distribution, use, and end-of-life scenarios (cradle-to-grave/cradle). Knowing the full scope is important to document the potential burdens that can be avoided in the customer value chain. Results may indicate a range of other environmental impacts, such as contributions to climate change, land and energy use considerations, or level of water consumption. At IFF, we use LCA to: •\t understand the environmental impacts of our products and processes •\t analyze sustainability performance at a product level, using it as a compass for transparent decision-making and communication •\t identify supply chain hot spots and opportunities for product improvements •\t evaluate new technologies and guide sustainable innovation through a data-driven, scientific approach that continuously drives more sustainable solutions LCAs range from screening level analyses to externally peer-reviewed studies on products and prove insightful for both guidance of pre-commercial products and for reporting on and marketing of commercial products. We have conducted LCAs for a wide range of our products, including soy and pea protein solutions, emulsifiers, hydrocolloids, frozen and freeze-dried cultures, enzyme production and applications, and scent ingredients, among others. LCAs of our products create significant value for our customers as they try to better understand and continuously reduce their upstream (Scope 3) impacts in line with their science-based GHG emissions reduction goals. For these and other reasons, we have built an in-house LCA team with the expertise to continue to strengthen our capabilities over time. Looking ahead, our plans for utilizing LCA are ambitious, including quantifying carbon, land, and water footprints for our portfolio of scent ingredients. LCA assesses potential environmental impacts from cradle-to-gate (i.e., from raw material acquisition to production) or cradle-to-grave/cradle (i.e., the entire life cycle including distribution, use, and end-of-life scenarios.)

As part of IFF’s Do More Good Plan, the Nourish division’s sustainability-focused development process serves unmet needs in the food and beverage market while contributing to positive environmental and social designs. IFF has six bold areas of innovation with our Re-Imagine programs, of which four are focused on making a positive ESG impact: RE-IMAGINE CLEAN™, RE- IMAGINE WASTE™, RE-IMAGINE PROTEIN® and RE-IMAGINE WELLNESS™. Each uses current and future IFF tools, technologies, and ingredient expertise to drive market- relevant innovation that facilitates full product design in alignment with changing consumer expectations. In 2021, under the RE-IMAGINE programs, we launched multiple new technologies to support our customers, of which three are directly connected to achieving internal sustainability goals and ambitions. 35 Appendix Equity & Wellbeing Responsible Sourcing Transparency & Accountability Climate & Planetary Health Sustainable Solutions Our ESG+ Commitment Introduction\n",
      "RE-IMAGINE PROTEIN® As the world struggles to mitigate escalating climate change, consumers are looking for better options in support of the planet and human health without compromising on taste and texture, prompting a full transition towards a new food system and an urgent need to redesign food product portfolios. Supporting the industry in maintaining indulgence and pleasure while reducing GHG emissions is a top priority for IFF, which we are achieving by offering a wide portfolio in flavors, colors, stabilizers, enzymes, starter cultures and plant proteins. In addition, IFF is looking to new innovative technologies through internal expertise as well as external collaboration to be at the forefront of this transition by continuing to offer new, sustainable options to the industry and consumers around the world. For example: •\t HOLDBAC® YM VEGE is an effective and label friendly solution designed for plant- based applications, to secure quality over shelf-life and reduce food waste. Crafted from a selection of beneficial microorganisms, our natural solution supports our customers to keep their product fresh for longer, further enabling their sustainability ambitions and positively increasing the consumer experience towards plant-based foods. •\t PLANT PROTEIN with SUPRO® range: We continuously develop new plant proteins to support the replacement of animal-based product around the world, providing the most advanced technology that offers the same texture and taste as animal protein. Associated today with maskers and flavor, it allows the industry to develop unique plant-based food to offer a broader range of products to the consumer which encourages a plant-based diet as the center of the plate. Multiple LCAs confirm that burgers using plant-based proteins save more than 25 tons of CO2e per ton of beef replaced. RE-IMAGINE CLEAN TM Based on our internal research, today’s consumers rank natural ingredients and environmental impact ahead of brand recognition and product descriptions. Clean label is the new norm – often defined as simple ingredients and products with ingredient purity and traceability. In response to the consumer desire for trust, transparency, and a healthier world across food and beverage categories, our RE-IMAGINE CLEAN™ program is delivering next generation solutions that are label-friendly, healthy, and responsible. For example, SEAFLOUR™ is a newly launched stabilizing ingredient sourced from traceable seaweed which replaces traditional hydrocolloids in plant-based beverages. This innovative, minimally processed ingredient preserves the seaweed’s natural content of fiber, proteins, and minerals which helps producers to meet consumer demand for cleaner, natural, and sustainable products without compromising functionality and taste. Other recently launched clean label flavor technologies include our collection of smoke and grill ingredients (further supporting the market for meat alternatives) and our coffee technology portfolio for flavors. 36 Appendix Equity & Wellbeing Responsible Sourcing Transparency & Accountability Climate & Planetary Health Sustainable Solutions Our ESG+ Commitment Introduction\n",
      "In support of this growing trend, IFF has been an Associate Member of the Upcycled Food Association (UFA) since 2019. In 2021, the UFA introduced the Upcycled Certified™ Program – the world’s first third-party certification for upcycled food ingredients and products. The certification mark serves to further legitimize food waste as a reputable and reliable ingredient source manufactured to the highest standards and provides consumers with clear guidance about the presence of upcycled food ingredients in food, beverages, cosmetics, pet food, personal care products, household cleaners, and dietary supplements. For example, through our partnership with Dutch start-up, PeelPioneers, we are utilizing fresh orange peels that are naturally rich in essential oils (and that would otherwise be discarded from retail settings) to create UPCYCLED ORANGE – one of 10 IFF products certified by the UFA in 2021 from across our Scent, Health & Biosciences and Nourish divisions. FOOD PROTECTION FOR PROCESSED MEAT According to the World Health Organization, ready-to-eat processed meats are in the high- risk category for contamination with Listeria monocytogenes, which causes listeriosis in consumers. NOVAGARD® NR 100-G is a synergistic blend of two natural ingredients: nisin A, a naturally occurring antimicrobial that has demonstrated its efficacy for more than 60 years; and rosemary extract, an approved flavor complex believed to have antioxidant and antimicrobial properties on top flavoring attributes. Together, they are an effective combination against gram-positive bacteria and spores. In poultry applications, for example, the blend has been seen to protect product quality for up to twice as long. Manufacturers can also secure the sensory quality of their products during shelf life. These solutions address not only health and safety, but also have the potential to reduce food waste. RE-IMAGINE WASTE TM The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) estimates that approximately one third of all food intended for human consumption is lost or wasted from farm to plate. This inefficiency results in significant economic, social, and environmental impacts, and hinders the world’s ability to adequately feed those who are hungry and undernourished. IFF’s RE-IMAGINE WASTE program is driving environmental consciousness around this issue by pioneering the future of food and beverage experiences through sustainable and regenerative design. With a focus on upcycling, shelf-life extension, and food safety, we are maximizing resources and reducing waste while expanding sustainable innovation across our food and beverage categories. UPCYCLING Upcycled foods use ingredients that otherwise would not have gone to human consumption, are procured and produced using verifiable supply chains, and have a positive impact on the environment. We create upcycled flavor extracts, such as coffee, botanicals, or smoke, from a variety of sustainable sources such as wood byproducts or spent biomass. 37 Appendix Equity & Wellbeing Responsible Sourcing Transparency & Accountability Climate & Planetary Health Sustainable Solutions Our ESG+ Commitment Introduction\n",

      "Health IFF’s Health business develops, manufactures, and sells probiotics, fibers, and natural extracts used in dietary supplements, as well as specialty ingredients for infant and elderly nutrition. Supporting the Company’s health and wellbeing objectives, the Health business delivers sustainable innovation that brings health benefits to consumers and ultimately to society. For example, a 2019 study published in the National Library of Medicine, “Probiotics Reduce Health Care Costs and Societal Impact of Flu-Like Respiratory Tract infections in the USA: An Economic Modeling Study,” found that taking a probiotic can reduce the number of sick days by more than 54 million days per year. IFF probiotic strains or strain-combinations provide benefits including digestive, cognitive, and immune health. The Health portfolio also includes natural health and nutrition ingredients derived from plants and herbs. Cultures & Food Enzymes IFF’s Cultures & Food Enzymes business promotes sustainability in food and beverage production. For our Cultures business, globally, IFF estimates that approximately one out of three yogurts and approximately half of all plant-based yogurts are made with our cultures. Our technologies allow our customers to reduce their environmental impact by conserving water and energy, reducing emissions, and enabling the use of locally grown raw materials. Our solutions aim to limit food waste and extend the shelf-life of food and beverage products while saving costs for our customers. In our Food Enzymes business, IFF estimates that approximately 20% of the global beer volume is made with IFF enzymes. With an eye toward always improving sustainability, our brewing business has built a process simulator that allows H&B to map our customers’ production processes and pinpoint where IFF’s technologies can help conserve energy and increase production efficiency. By extending the analysis from a recently published LCA on brewing with exogenous enzymes and un-malted barley or sorghum to displace malted barley in beer production, benefits for additional regions were evaluated. In Brazil, for example, our new enzymatic solutions used in conjunction with un-malted barley were shown to significantly reduce environmental impacts compared to brewing with malted barley – resulting in reductions of CO2 emissions by 36%; of non-renewable energy consumption by 47%; of water consumption by 41%; and of the area needed for the cultivation of raw materials by 4%. 40 Appendix Equity & Wellbeing Responsible Sourcing Transparency & Accountability Climate & Planetary Health Sustainable Solutions Our ESG+ Commitment Introduction\n",
      "Home & Personal Care IFF’s Home & Personal Care business supplies sustainable alternatives to industries in the cleaning and personal care sector, where performance is paramount. We bring our passion for the planet and bioscience know- how to partner with customers who are serious about finding more sustainable solutions without sacrificing the effectiveness of their products. As the business that developed the enzyme technology for cold water washing, our products can be found in a large percentage of the world’s cold water wash product. Inherently natural and biodegradable, our cleaning enzymes are both efficient and effective; excelling in short cycle, low temperature washes to ensure detergents deliver sustainable cleaning with no compromises. If just one load of laundry per week in each household was washed in cold water for one year, the U.S. could realize significant reductions in energy from natural gas, and, in turn, lower related GHG emissions. Animal Nutrition & Health IFF’s Animal Nutrition & Health business works every day to improve the overall sustainability of the animal protein value chain by reducing its impact on the environment, improving animal welfare, and reducing costs for producers. This includes meeting nutritional health needs at the heart of antibiotic-free and sustainable livestock production. Applying our suite of phytase solutions to swine and poultry feed enables animals to break down phytate in the feed to access the previously unavailable phosphorus and reduce or eliminate the need for adding inorganic phosphate to their diets. The phytase also improves overall digestibility, providing the same animal performance and weight gain using 3-5% lower feed rates. Based on our internal assessments, each year, a poultry farm could save a significant amount of feed and inorganic phosphate by using IFF phytase, translating to cost savings for the farmer and lower overall GHG emissions. 41 Appendix Equity & Wellbeing Responsible Sourcing Transparency & Accountability Climate & Planetary Health Sustainable Solutions Our ESG+ Commitment Introduction\n",
      "Grain Processing A majority of IFF’s Grain Processing business uses enzymes to produce ethanol from corn – a sustainable value proposition that creates renewable fuel from nature. IFF yeasts, glucoamylase, and alpha-amylase enzyme solutions enable the production of fuel ethanol, which displaces gasoline in passenger vehicles. Based on cradle-to-tailpipe emissions per the GREET® Model from Argonne National Labs and our internal assessments, the ethanol produced from a typical U.S. facility using IFF enzymes and yeast has the potential to provide significantly less CO2 emissions. Additionally, our scientists are constantly improving technologies that not only increase ethanol yield and efficiency in the production process, but also lead to lower water and energy usage. This business also serves carbohydrate processing customers who produce food and feed ingredients such as high fructose corn syrup. The Grain Processing business provides customers in this market with enzymes that enhance those processes by reducing the water and energy necessary to process corn and wheat. A product called OPTIMASH® WHEAT XL enables wheat processors to improve their efficiency without changing their plants.

      "CLIMATE & PLANETARY HEALTH In 2021, following the merger with N&B, our business not only expanded its breadth of capabilities and expertise, but also our environmental footprint. In preparation for combined company operations, significant preplanning efforts were initiated in 2020 to gauge, measure, and understand the expected combined company footprint. This preplanning was done to help lay the groundwork to meet the continuous environmental performance improvement that IFF historically demonstrated. With a larger footprint and new baseline in 2021 for our 2030 goals, IFF is now expanding our environmental commitments as a combined company to fully align with IFF’s purpose: applying science and creativity for a better world. In alignment with this purpose, in 2021, we published and communicated our new Global Environmental Sustainability Policy for the combined company, which demonstrates our commitment to being a force for a better and more sustainable future.

For waste management, a “major manufacturing facility” is defined as a site that generates more than 100 metric tons of hazardous and nonhazardous waste annually. STRATEGY & APPROACH With the N&B merger came the opportunity to combine strengths, and we manage our environmental footprint through the combined company’s new Energy & Carbon team, made up of representatives from Sustainability, Operations, and Global Procurement. In 2021, we expanded the reach and impact of our dedicated capital expenditure (capex) fund to catalyze progress on our corporate goals. After receiving submissions of more than 200 sustainability-related project proposals in line with key performance indicators, the Energy & Carbon team selected projects with the greatest potential to achieve significant reductions in energy, water, waste, and GHG emissions across targeted sites globally. This team also meets monthly with a steering group comprised of operations and functional leaders who work collaboratively in critical decision making to accelerate the execution of the environmental pillar of the Do More Good Plan. The Energy & Carbon team reviews the status of key environmental performance indicators and provides updates to the EVP of Operations on a quarterly basis. Looking ahead, the Do More Good Plan will also help to facilitate expanded transparency and oversight for ESG at the Board of Directors level, and through the Innovation and Sustainability Committee. We also understand the importance of validating the execution of our strategy, including with the support of external certification systems such as ISO14001, a globally recognized set of environmental standards that helps organizations measure and manage their operational impacts on the environment. Adhering to ISO 14001 improves resource efficiency, supports waste reduction strategies, manages costs, and underscores our commitment to continuous improvement. IFF’s major manufacturing facilities9 are ISO 14001 certified or in the process of becoming certified. For those facilities that fall below ISO’s threshold classification of a “major manufacturing facility” due to their size, we strive to follow consistent procedures to leverage the benefits of the ISO certification process.

Scope 3 Categories 1, 2, and 4 are calculated off actual spend by category; Categories 3 and 5 are calculated from source activity data; and Category 6 is calculated from data provided by travel agent data. For Scope 3 spend-based calculations, EPA EEIO factors that include related transportation and distribution margins are used. Standards and Basis of Calculations for Environmental Data The organizational boundaries for this report align with the Operational Control approach outlined in the GHG Protocol. Following Scope 1 Guidance for Direct Emissions, we use appropriate emission factors from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) 2006 Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Fugitive Emissions Guidance. For electricity (Scope 2 emissions), we follow the EPA’s 2022 eGrid Subregion emission factors and the latest International Energy Agency emission factors. Emission factors for purchased steam are specific for each site and are provided by the suppliers. Emissions for process-derived fuels are specific to each site and are calculated by mass balance based on product mix. The emissions calculations include GHGs covered by the Kyoto Protocol – carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O), hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), perfluorocarbons (PFCs) and sulfur hexafluoride (SF6) – and are reported as CO2 equivalents (CO2e). We use the global warming potentials provided in the IPCC’s Fifth Assessment Report. We report both market-based and location-based emissions data in this ESG+ report, which follow the methodologies provided in the Scope 2 Guidance of the GHG Protocol. Market-based emissions use supplier-specific emission factors and include renewable energy credits. IFF’s GHG emissions are calculated according to the Greenhouse Gas Protocol, a rigorous process that has now been expanded to include the combined company and inform our new 2021 baseline. This ESG Report includes all Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions (for which we target less than 5% data estimation), and for Scope 3, we include six of the 15 Greenhouse Gas Protocol categories that are supported by actual spend data and activity data: Category 1 - Purchased goods and services; Category 2 - Capital goods; Category 3 - Fuel- and energy-related activities; Category 4 - Upstream transportation and distribution; Category 5 - Waste generated in operations; and Category 6 – Business travel (see IFF Performance Data, page 197).13 IFF has determined that four additional Scope 3 categories out of the 15 are also relevant (Category 7 - Employee commuting; Category 9 - Downstream transportation and distribution; Category 10 - Processing of sold products; and Category 12 - End-of-life treatment of sold products).

As part of the Do More Good Plan, IFF has two internal water stewardship metrics for the combined company focused on increasing efficiency efforts and watershed management. •\t First, we aim to increase water use efficiency across the portfolio, which includes process improvements and use of recycled water for non-product operations. We began to make significant progress in reducing our global water footprint for the combined company during 2021. We will continue to fund water saving projects and have identified more than 30 significant water recycling and efficiency opportunities for 2022. •\t Second, we will focus on driving collective action for water stewardship in the communities where we source and operate.17 As the risks of water scarcity and overconsumption increase around the world, particularly in locations with high baseline water stress, we strive to reduce our water use and consumption through increased efficiency and other water management strategies. 17. Facility communities are identified based on risk profiles using the World Resources Institute’s Aqueduct tool and Ecolab’s Water Risk Monetizer. Water continues to be a critical input to all IFF’s business operations. In 2021, we completed more than 15 projects focused on reducing water withdrawal, with the most savings resulting from condensate recovery for reuse and optimizing clean-in-place (CIP) processes. These projects are expected to reduce water withdrawal by more than 120,000 cubic meters per year, contributing to a 5.5% year-over-year absolute water reduction for legacy IFF. Our water footprint increased by more than 21 times in 2021 following the merger with N&B, with 4.4 million cubic meters of water withdrawn by legacy IFF sites versus 95.5 million cubic meters of water withdrawn as a combined company. Of this larger footprint, we know that the Ingredients business within our Nourish division, in combination with our Health & Biosciences division, accounts for approximately 80% of our combined company water withdrawal. Not only is water used for cooling, steam generation, feedstock processing, and cleaning, it is a significant input for production of core texturants, proteins, food ingredients, and enzymes. We also rely on water indirectly for all agricultural- related processes throughout our supply chain.

      "In order to map our water footprint and manage possible risks, we use several publicly available and globally recognized tools for informing water stewardship approaches. To identify water stress, flood occurrence and drought severity risks for our manufacturing facilities, for example, we use the World Resources Institute’s (WRI) Water Risk Atlas tool, Aqueduct. On a project basis, we use other tools, such as the World Business Council for Sustainable Development’s Global Water Tool and the U.S. EPA’s Surf Your Watershed tool. We also use Ecolab’s Water Risk Monetizer to help understand water-related risks and to quantify them in financial terms. We analyze risk on an annual basis to identify areas of our operations with potentially high baseline water stress as classified by the WRI Aqueduct tool and other tools. Results from the initial screening indicate that 2.3% of our total water withdrawal in 2021 came from regions with high or extremely high baseline water stress. We use these results to further focus our water stewardship efforts. We have identified three facilities with potentially elevated risk, and we have completed initial calls with the facilities to indicate that water risk and usage is managed well. However, we have identified one facility with a significant opportunity to improve, and we are working to identify projects to increase efficiencies and protect the local watershed. As a follow up in 2022, we will be working with the facility to outline a detailed water action plan. 61 Appendix Equity & Wellbeing Responsible Sourcing Transparency & Accountability Climate & Planetary Health Sustainable Solutions Our ESG+ Commitment Introduction\n",
      "Waste Management As part of our comprehensive approach to managing waste, we are continually tracking and monitoring trends that affect our production while monitoring key performance metrics against waste categories. We track two types of waste, nonhazardous and hazardous waste, the latter of which can be generated by unavoidable chemical manufacturing processes. In 2021, legacy IFF nonhazardous waste was 56,720 metric tons. This has increased compared to 2020 due in part to an increase in production volumes and more rigorous data assessments. Due to better categorization, we are seeing an increase in more beneficial disposal methods such as recovery, reuse, recycling, and composting. As part of the integration, we have expanded the collection of nonhazardous waste data for the combined company which resulted in a 2021 baseline of 557,310 metric tons. For hazardous waste, in 2021 legacy IFF generated 26,989 metric tons. This is an increase compared to 2020 due in part to growth and new facility production volumes. In addition, due to increased categorization of data, we are seeing an increase in beneficial recovery, reuse, and recycling. As part of the integration we have expanded the collection of hazardous waste data, which has resulted in a new 2021 baseline for the combined company of 45,355 metric tons. In 2021, we executed projects to eliminate hazardous waste, such as upgrading boilers, improving cleaning processes, and optimizing the use of volatile organic compounds. 2021 NONHAZARDOUS WASTE BY DISPOSAL METHOD (LEGACY IFF) 28.3% 19.5% 9.6% 20.2% 12.4% 10.0% 56,720.1 metric tons ● Recycling ● Energy Recovery ● Landfill ● Composting ● Incineration ● Other 2021 NONHAZARDOUS WASTE BY DISPOSAL METHOD (COMBINED COMPANY) 60.3% 7.7% 11.6% 17.6% 1.2% 1.6% 557,313.8 metric tons ● Recycling ● Energy Recovery ● Landfill ● Composting ● Incineration ● Other 62 Appendix Equity & Wellbeing Responsible Sourcing Transparency & Accountability Climate & Planetary Health Sustainable Solutions Our ESG+ Commitment Introduction\n",
      "ZERO WASTE TO LANDFILL We are also particularly focused on eliminating the concept of nonhazardous and hazardous waste in our operations by promoting our ZWL program, which encourages our Green Teams and employees to implement and verify innovative solutions to reduce waste intended for landfill by reusing and recycling materials. During 2021, we also leveraged our knowledge, philosophy, and best practices regarding our ZWL across the entire combined company, making significant progress by internally verifying 13 new facilities as ZWL, including two from heritage N&B. To achieve ZWL verified status, more than 98% of all trash, recyclables, and other waste streams from the manufacturing process must be diverted away from landfill by being re-used, recycled, or incinerated. Following this internal framework, as of 2021, we have verified a total of 24 out of 103 facilities as ZWL (or 22.3%) for the combined company, and we are accelerating our progress to meet our goal outlined in our Do More Good Plan.

      "PLASTICS MINIMIZATION In 2021, IFF initiated a single-use plastic pilot program to study plastic usage in our Creative & Design (C&D) centers. The intent of the pilot was to gather base data of all the categories of single use plastic in the C&D laboratories and identify potential replacement items that minimize or eliminate the use of single use plastic. This was a grassroots effort championed by passionate employees in the C&D department, with a core team comprising members from the business unit C&D teams, as well as Sustainability and Global Procurement. As part of our commitment to Do More Good, the team was empowered to identify needs and then drive forward with solutions. Initial findings indicated that at least 70% of all plastic items fall into four categories of bags, bottles and caps, cups and containers, and pipets. Minimizing the use of single use plastic is a key element of the Do More Good Plan, and moving forward into 2022, the learnings from this pilot program will be expanded to other parts of the business that also currently rely on plastic. Strategy into Action: Doing More Good through IT Our employees are on the front lines of identifying ways to operate more sustainably, save resources and reduce costs while meeting the environmental performance expectations of our customers and other stakeholders. Without our employees, the improvements we seek to reach our goals would not be possible. For example, with an eye toward the digital future, our Information Technology (IT) department continued to take steps in 2021 to increase the flexibility, reliability, security, and efficiency of our global IT infrastructure, while reducing waste and energy consumption. These efforts included the following: •\t Responsibly disposing of electronic waste: In support of IFF’s ZWL goal, we have partnerships in place with specialized disposal companies in select global locations to recycle and responsibly dispose of e-waste (i.e., discarded electrical or electronic devices). In 2021, since expanding our e-waste partner globally, we have recorded 19.3715 U.S. tons of e-waste. We also moved from a largely site-by-site management approach to implementing a global solution that now provides end-to-end visibility of the process and will improve tracking of e-waste disposal for IFF sites moving forward. •\t Migrating to the cloud: From email to expense reports to business analytics, IFF is increasingly leveraging cloud-delivered software that drives sustainable resource efficiencies. We continued to accelerate this transition to achieve optimal automation, consistency and availability while reducing the fixed costs and potential capacity expansion delays associated with server maintenance. Going forward, we will also build all bespoke applications cloud-first to utilize on-demand cloud capacity. •\t Refreshing equipment: As part of our responsible e-waste disposal strategy, we continued to progress on our workstation refresh program, which runs in five-year cycles to replace older IT equipment with eco-friendly, energy efficient alternatives. This global program included upgrading monitors that automatically go into sleep mode after periods of inactivity, as well as replacing traditional hard drives with more energy efficient solid-state hard drives. 64 Appendix Equity & Wellbeing Responsible Sourcing Transparency & Accountability Climate & Planetary Health Sustainable Solutions Our ESG+ Commitment Introduction\n",

      "Responsible sourcing at IFF is grounded in the policies, practices, and procedures we employ to sustainably procure the goods or services that serve as inputs to our products. We seek to do this in ways that reduce our impact to the environment, including biodiversity impacts and land-use considerations. We recognize that our footprint extends beyond our own operational control and that we must influence our entire value chain to make a positive impact. We are also committed to supporting the health, wellbeing, and financial security of the workers and grower communities in our supply chain through our global shared value programs. Toward this end, we engage closely with our suppliers by monitoring and supporting their continuous improvement in ESG performance; aligning their practices with our own values and strategy; and promoting supplier diversity. Our supply chain is broad and complex, and our portfolio has only expanded further following our merger with N&B. As of 2021, we purchased approximately 28,500 different raw materials sourced from an extensive global network of suppliers. In 2021, we again worked to maintain our critical role in the global consumer goods supply chain, despite the lingering and compounding effects of a global pandemic stretching into its second year.

      "Integration Focus Throughout 2021, we accelerated key integration activities to harmonize the Responsible Sourcing programs of both legacy IFF and heritage N&B – bringing the best of each together in complementary ways. This included, for example, integrating our supplier base and launching targeted training sessions with Global Procurement buyers from both legacy entities to promote awareness of combined corporate responsible sourcing programs. These and other integration exercises helped us identify existing synergies and new opportunities and challenges. For example, following the merger, we had to adjust strategic priorities in response to heightened expectations from our expanded customer base on topics such as deforestation, regenerative agriculture, human rights for supply chains at risk, living incomes, community projects, audits, and certifications. Also, with the expanded post- merger IFF divisions in 2021, we ensured that our Responsible Sourcing program addressed all four business unit priorities while being fully agile in managing new frontiers, such as integrating increased volumes of data from multiple sources and updating supplier relationship ownership. Following a successful pilot program in 2021, to harmonize data from legacy systems, we are continuing to integrate responsible sourcing data for full IFF spend. During this integration and transition year, we also paused the normal proceedings of our Responsible Sourcing Committee, co-led by our Vice President, Chief Procurement Officer, as well as our Vice President, Global Sustainability & Environmental, Health and Safety. In lieu of quarterly meetings, the Responsible Sourcing team worked closely with the Committee’s two co-sponsors on a regular basis to reorganize and establish a new combined company approach for the Committee to include new stakeholders from all business divisions, thereby ensuring a successful governance structure beginning in 2022.

      "19. RSPO physical models include RSPO Identity Preserved (IP), RSPO Segregated (SG) and RSPO Mass Balance (MB). As part of our integration activities in 2021, we refreshed and relaunched several policies to ensure alignment of corporate priorities reflective of the combined company; be more responsive to evolving customer expectations; and expand our position on important topics such as biodiversity, deforestation, and sustainable agriculture. Our approach to human rights, responsible sourcing, and sustainable natural resource management – including our expectations of all stakeholders – are outlined in the following policies and commitments: •\t Vendor Code of Conduct: Updated in January 2021 and available in six languages, the Vendor Code sets forth the basic requirements a vendor must meet to maintain a business relationship with IFF. We expect our suppliers, and their suppliers, to conduct their business ethically and honestly and in compliance with all applicable laws, rules, regulations, and industry standards, including those concerning workplace safety and human rights. Through our vendor onboarding process, led by Global Procurement, new vendors are provided with the Vendor Code and must acknowledge in our procurement system that they have received and read it. Existing suppliers must acknowledge our Vendor Code with each contract renewal. POLICIES & COMMITMENTS •\t Global Human Rights Policy: Updated in 2021, this Policy outlines IFF’s explicit support for all internationally recognized human rights standards. Discrimination, child labor and forced or compulsory labor are prohibited, and we expect our vendors to recognize and respect their employees’ rights to freely associate and engage in collective bargaining. •\t Slavery and Human Trafficking Statement: Updated annually, our most recent 2021 Statement outlines our commitment to conducting business in a sustainable and lawful manner that respects the human rights of workers and provides information on our global human rights due diligence processes. •\t Responsible Sourcing Policy: Relaunched in November 2021, this Policy outlines IFF’s expectations with respect to the responsible sourcing of raw materials. It aligns with IFF’s global procurement commitments and global sustainability goals while promoting engagement and standardized communication with our suppliers. Updates to the refreshed Policy include a new section on our Supplier Diversity Program; more detailed descriptions of our third-party certification programs; expanded environmental conservation and biodiversity enhancement sections on deforestation, conversion and degradation, and aquatic ecosystems (e.g., seaweed); and more coverage of our human rights due diligence programs. •\t Sustainable Palm Oil Policy: To be reflective of the combined company, we launched an updated commitment on palm oil in December 2021 that outlines the implementation steps we are taking to drive improvement through our palm oil supply chain and contribute to the transformation of the wider palm oil sector. This includes a new goal to source exclusively from the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) members that offer 100% physical19 certified RSPO palm oil, palm kernel oil and their derivatives by 2025 globally. For more information on our management approach for palm oil, please see page 72. •\t Sustainable Soy Policy: In December 2021, for the first time, we formalized our commitment to producing soy in a sustainable manner by conserving native vegetation and biodiversity and respecting human rights. The new Policy also includes a goal to source from deforestation and conversion-free soybeans and soy white flakes by 2025 in North America and Brazil. 69 Appendix Equity & Wellbeing Responsible Sourcing Transparency & Accountability Climate & Planetary Health Sustainable Solutions Our ESG+ Commitment Introduction\n",
      "IFF has rigorous quality and sustainability expectations for our suppliers. On the quality side, our Vendor Management program and internal auditors help to ensure that our suppliers meet these expectations. Selected new raw material suppliers undergo initial audits of their operations to confirm that they meet IFF’s quality requirements and standards, while existing suppliers are audited on an ongoing, periodic basis. These auditing efforts are complemented by our Vendor Quality Risk Management program, which tracks vendor performance to help determine audit frequency. Our vendor risk scorecards, which are managed by our Global Quality function, allow us to focus our resources where the needs are greatest. Similarly, our Responsible Sourcing program assesses vendors for environmental, social and governance risks based on the vendor’s country of operation. We also track the corporate social responsibility performance of vendors. For material-specific risks, we categorize natural raw materials and renewables based on country of harvest. In summary, both our Vendor Management and our Responsible Sourcing RISK ASSESSMENT & PRIORITIZATION programs allow us to share best practices and technical advice with our suppliers to support them in making continuous improvements. With respect to evaluating specific naturals and renewable ingredients for environmental and social risks and performance, we use a similar approach to that of our vendor risk management process: identify and prioritize risks so they can be appropriately mitigated. 70 Appendix Equity & Wellbeing Responsible Sourcing Transparency & Accountability Climate & Planetary Health Sustainable Solutions Our ESG+ Commitment Introduction\n",
      "Risk Assessment Methodology Our risk assessment methodology helps to identify inherent sourcing risks for suppliers and ingredients based on their countries of operation. The methodology was validated in 2017 by the Rainforest Alliance – an international nongovernmental organization working to build strong forests, healthy agricultural landscapes and thriving communities. In 2019, we expanded our risk assessment tool to incorporate global ESG risk insights, and in 2021, we completed a risk methodology refresh with the Rainforest Alliance since new data was available for most indices the tool relies on. Specifically the tool covers: •\t Environmental risks related to water, climate change, biodiversity, agriculture, and deforestation, using input sources such as the World Resources Institute and academic studies. •\t Social risks related to human rights and labor rights, using sources such as the Global Slavery Index, the World Bank, and the U.N. Development Programme. •\t Governance risks related to government effectiveness and corruption, using sources such as the Global Slavery Index, Worldwide Governance Indicators and Transparency International. We also conduct hot-spot screenings on raw materials that have been flagged by credible sources and other risk tools, such as the U.S. Department of Labor’s List of Goods Produced by Child Labor or Forced Labor and the NEPCon Sourcing Hub, among others. Our risk assessment methodology guides our policies, programs, and strategies. For example, we have identified deforestation as an area of potential risk. As outlined in our Responsible Sourcing Policy, we expect suppliers to ensure that natural raw materials and naturally derived ingredients are not linked to deforestation. Similarly, the design of many of our shared value community programs incorporates opportunities to support biodiversity and reforestation (see page 83). In 2021, IFF conducted a risk assessment for our legacy IFF suppliers and approximately 75% of renewables and natural ingredients. The results of the assessment inform our supplier engagement activities, assessment and audit requirements, and procurement decisions. As a next step, a risk assessment for heritage N&B suppliers and materials is also planned for roll out. 71 Appendix Equity & Wellbeing Responsible Sourcing Transparency & Accountability Climate & Planetary Health Sustainable Solutions Our ESG+ Commitment Introduction\n",
      "STRATEGIC RAW MATERIALS Our risk assessment methodology drives our policies, programs, and commitments for specific supply chains. Three of our most important strategic materials include soy, palm, and seaweed. Soy The production of soy has rapidly expanded in the last few years in tropical regions due to rising market demand (mainly as animal feed), but this growth has also been associated with environmental and human rights risks, including threats to biodiversity-rich biomes. IFF is not involved in the production of soybeans, but our purchase of soy-based raw materials includes soybeans and soybean flakes. We operate primarily in the Business-to-Business market and our first-tier suppliers are manufacturers, traders, refiners, cooperatives, and producers that use soybeans grown predominantly in the United States. As a global business, we know we have an impact on, and can influence, the markets we serve; therefore, we partner with our suppliers to source sustainable products. Transparency about soybeans origin needs to be ensured, and we believe soy should be produced in a sustainable manner by conserving native vegetation and biodiversity and respecting human rights. As part of our commitment to improve our supply chain and support sector-wide transformational change, we formalized a Sustainable Soy Policy in 2021 for the combined company that outlines our commitment to source from deforestation and conversion free soybeans and soy white flakes by 2025 in North America and Brazil. Palm Palm oil production is often linked to deforestation, biodiversity destruction and human rights abuses. At IFF, we use approximately 0.16% of the palm oil and palm kernel oil produced worldwide, but we recognize we have an important role to play in ensuring that the palm oil in our supply chain – no matter how limited – comes from sustainable sources. As an ordinary member of the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) – a global, multi-stakeholder initiative to develop and implement global standards for sustainable palm oil – we seek to ensure that our palm oil supply chain does not contribute to deforestation, peat clearance or human rights abuses. Since 2020, IFF has also been a member of the North American Sustainable Palm Oil Network (NASPON), an independent group of associations, civil society organizations and others committed to increasing the use of certified sustainable palm oil in North America. In 2021, we refreshed our Sustainable Palm Oil Policy with a commitment to source from deforestation- and conversion-free palm oil supply chains by 2025 and continue to support RSPO as a mechanism to mainstream sustainable palm oil. We will source exclusively from RSPO members and source 100% physical certified RSPO palm oil, palm kernel oil and their derivatives by 2025 globally. We will also increase RSPO Supply Chain certification for our manufacturing facilities, enabling us to supply RSPO certified ingredients to our customers. 72 Appendix Equity & Wellbeing Responsible Sourcing Transparency & Accountability Climate & Planetary Health Sustainable Solutions Our ESG+ Commitment Introduction\n",
      "This year we also refreshed the palm traceability study we first conducted in 2019. Using 2020 pre-merger data, we completed an upstream investigation for 22 suppliers, representing approximately 32% of palm volumes for the legacy IFF business. The study included a supply chain mapping exercise that identified more than 1,600 mills in our palm supply chain. Of those, the traceability results revealed that 22% of the mills are RSPO certified. These and other insights from this study not only help raise awareness of the limited availability of certified supply globally, but also help us identify our next steps for expanding responsible supplier engagement and purchasing practices. In this way, we aim to further increase transparency and encourage RSPO certification. Looking ahead, we will again conduct a palm traceability study using 2021 data for the combined company. To meet customer demand for certified palm oil products, we intend to purchase palm oil products from suppliers that have made public commitments to protect human rights and avoid deforestation and development on peat lands or high-conservation-value areas. We currently have 29 plants that meet the standards of RSPO Supply Chain Certification. Looking ahead, we will continue our close partnership with the RSPO and NASPON to further contribute to the sustainability of palm oil globally. See IFF’s Annual Communication of Progress (ACOP) for the RSPO here. Leading the Way In 2021, N&B was recognized on WWF’s Palm Oil Buyers Scorecard as “Leading the Way” toward the transformative actions that will be required to halt the unsustainable production of palm oil. Scoring 19.7 out of 24 points — well above the average score of 13.2 – N&B was ranked among the top 10% of the 227 manufacturers, retailers and hospitality companies who responded to the 2021 scorecard (submitting 2020 pre-merger data). Moving forward, we will finalize the integration of the sustainable palm oil programs from both legacy organizations, building on the strengths of both sides. 73 Appendix Equity & Wellbeing Responsible Sourcing Transparency & Accountability Climate & Planetary Health Sustainable Solutions Our ESG+ Commitment Introduction\n",
      "After successfully completing a “Phase 1” social and environmental assessment and land use plan, the SLP progressed on Phase 2 activities during 2021, including a reforestation and agroforestry trial, as well as a human rights and economic impact assessment and monitoring program. The initiative supports the livelihoods of up to 1,000 people, including 260 smallholder farmers. Looking ahead, we aim to further scale the program to also support neighbouring villages and expand GHG emissions reduction through forest protection, peat rewetting, water management, and fire patrols. sustainability collaboration program funded by the MARIPOSA initiative called WISSMA (Wilmar Supports Sustainable Management) was launched in 2021, spanning eight Latin American countries, involving six industry associations, and 54 suppliers. The program aims to build new partnerships, strengthen mill management, and facilitate a dialogue between suppliers and customers. CONSERVING LANDSCAPES AND LIVELIHOODS IN INDONESIA In Sungai Linau, Indonesia, a village of approximately 14,000 hectares, two thirds of the land is peat swamp forest, and the remaining third is agricultural land, mostly used for palm production. To help protect this community, the Sungai Linau Landscape Conservation and Livelihoods Programme (SLP) established a collaboration between the public and private sector to be coordinated by Proforest and Daemeter. IFF is proud to be among a coalition of other companies, along with grant funding from the UK government, to support the SLP in developing community-based land use, strengthening village members’ livelihoods, protecting high conservation value and high carbon stock forest, and reducing GHG emissions through forest and peat protection. FRIENDS OF SUSTAINABLE PALM OIL FROM LATIN AMERICA To support the implementation of sustainable palm oil practices in Latin America, we participate in the MARIPOSA crowdfunding initiative, led by IFF’s supplier, Olenex, one of the largest buyers of palm oil in the region. This program offers the opportunity for donors (or ‘Friends of sustainable palm oil from Latin America) to support the development of smallholder farmers into sustainable entrepreneurs while strengthening the reputation of palm oil from Latin America by meeting stringent sustainability criteria. With an emphasis on training local oil palm growers and processors (mills), MARIPOSA raises funds to finance sustainability programmes in Latin America and allow the fast-growing palm oil industry to transform into a sustainable agri-business. The first three-year project under MARIPOSA called WISSE (Wilmar Supports Sustainable Entrepreneurs) reached the end of its second year in 2021. Despite pandemic-related challenges, the four mills in the program and their independent smallholders fulfilled all planned activities, with 306 smallholders now certified under WISSE, representing 47% of the project’s goal.

      "Seaweed Following the merger with N&B, we expanded our global leadership position in high-value ingredients derived from seaweed and we are now one of the world’s largest buyers of seaweed for hydrocolloids (such as alginates and carrageenan that are essential ingredients for many foods, pharmaceuticals, fertilizers, and cosmetics). Through our Responsible Seaweed Program (RSP), we carefully source red and brown seaweed from cold and warm water locations around the world. This includes processing both wet and dry seaweed to produce best-in-class alginate and carrageenan products for customers in both our Nourish and Pharma Solutions divisions. At the core of the RSP’s continuous improvement process is a comprehensive set of “Environmental & Social Good Practices for Seaweed Harvesting” (“the Practices”) that include a variety of key environmental and social criteria, from habitat impacts and farm materials and waste, to worker health and safety. The Practices were developed as part of our partnership with the Anderson Cabot Center for Ocean Life at the New England Aquarium (ACCOL) – a cutting-edge marine research institution in Boston, Massachusetts, U.S. – and approved by an independent advisory group of subject matter experts. Going a step beyond IFF’s own first-party self-assessment processes to enhance the level of rigor and impartiality, ACCOL currently evaluates the performance of seaweed harvest areas as a second-party verification against the Practices. Several harvest areas representing most of our coldwater seaweed supply chain volumes were assessed according to this collaborative, two-step assurance model for the first time in 2020 and 2021. As part of the evaluation, ACCOL also provides support to the sites by identifying opportunities for further improvement. The Practices will be periodically reviewed to reflect the latest science and incorporate lessons learned from the implementation of the RSP. As part of our integration activities in 2021, we consolidated our RSP through evaluations, delivering new internal capacity building materials and more strategically positioning the program externally, such as by contributing to the Practical Guidance for the UNGC Sustainable Ocean Principles: Seaweed, intended to promote ocean health and emphasize the shared responsibility of all businesses to secure a productive marine ecosystem. IFF also became a signatory of the Seaweed Manifesto, a visionary statement for the industry that describes how seaweed can contribute to achieving the U.N.

      "MONITORING PERFORMANCE An important part of our approach to responsible sourcing is ensuring that we self-monitor our own performance as a supplier to our customers, as well as align with like-minded organizations that support and reinforce our commitments. Union for Ethical BioTrade Memberships Within IFF’s Scent Division, both LMR and SCB, part of LMC, are members of the Union for Ethical BioTrade (UEBT), an internationally recognized non-profit association made up of member companies in the natural ingredient supply chains for the food, cosmetics, and natural pharmaceutical sectors who are committed to ensuring that their products are made with ingredients sourced with respect for people and biodiversity. Motivated by our ambition to continually improve our sourcing practices and respond to our stakeholders’ demand for ethically sourced, natural products, IBR, part of LMC, also became a UEBT member in 2021. Being a member of UEBT sets a guidepost for how we should harvest, collect, or grow ingredients from biodiversity in a way that is respectful of the local environment and the people who call it home. As such, LMR and SCB continue to maintain their annual action plans and progress in reporting to UEBT. As a Provisional Member, IBR successfully passed the UEBT membership assessment and complies with UEBT entry indicators and is in the process of acquiring full UEBT membership. In 2021, we also participated in two events organized by UEBT. In October 2021, as part of the leadup to the U.N. 15th Conference of the Parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity (COP15), SCB’s General Manager participated in a panel discussion on how to ensure corporate actions are working to ‘bend the curve’ of nature loss by slowing down or halting biodiversity loss while restoring nature. Secondly, in December 2021, IFF’s Responsible Sourcing leader, along with other leaders in major fragrance houses, participated in a UEBT Digital Dialogue to discuss the challenges and opportunities in the sector for having an influence and impact on the ethical sourcing of ingredients from biodiversity.

      "Supplier Diversity As outlined in our Vendor Code of Conduct, we promote diversity within our supply chain and expect our vendors to do the same. One key objective of IFF’s inclusive supply chain principles is to identify, develop, and utilize certified diverse businesses that can enhance our competitive advantage and provide innovative and cost-effective products and services for us and our customers. Following the merger with N&B, we extended our activities to achieve internal objectives and included inclusive supply chain principles that help identify, develop, and utilize certified diverse businesses that can enhance our competitive advantage and provide innovative and cost-effective products and services. Toward this end, we also extended diverse supplier organizational services to all Global Procurement to help in the reporting and identification of new and current diverse businesses. Diverse businesses – the definition for which vary by country – refer to businesses owned, controlled, and operated by diverse persons. For example, in the United States, a “diverse business” is a company that is certified to be at least 51%-owned, -operated and -controlled by one or more minority, woman, LGBTIQ+ person, person with a disability, veteran, service-disabled veteran, or aboriginal or indigenous person. Looking ahead, we are extending our regional and global scope to include small companies and companies in underdeveloped/developing countries, in collaboration with other organizations, such as WEConnect International. 77 Appendix Equity & Wellbeing Responsible Sourcing Transparency & Accountability Climate & Planetary Health Sustainable Solutions Our ESG+ Commitment Introduction\n",
      "to complete the CDP questionnaire about their GHG emissions, the results from which are used to improve our Scope 3 (value chain) emission estimates and better prioritize future mitigation measures. As part of this effort, we work with industry partners and the CDP Supply Chain platform to reach out to suppliers and offer encouragement, support, training and guidance (such as through webinars and discussions) about how to participate in the CDP climate change reporting initiative. In 2021, for the second consecutive year, we proudly joined more than 400 companies in earning a place as a leading company on CDP’s Supplier Engagement Leaderboard for taking action to measure and reduce climate risk across our value chain by working with our suppliers to reduce their GHG emissions and raise their level of climate ambition. This recognition places IFF among the top 8% of companies who disclosed to CDP’s full climate questionnaire in 2021. In 2022, we aim to increase our supplier engagement on climate reporting to 200 suppliers. Supplier Engagement In addition to monitoring our own performance, programs, and commitments, we also monitor the performance of the suppliers we do business with. As part of the material approval process, we query suppliers on responsible sourcing practices, traceability, and other relevant topics. We leverage different tools to monitor and assess our supply chain’s responsible sourcing status. For example, our internal vendor questionnaire covers questions regarding suppliers’ own corporate social responsibility management and sustainability programs, including responsible sourcing topics and traceability. We also partner with like-minded organizations and others in our value chain to monitor and assess our suppliers’ sustainability commitments and responsible sourcing practices. CDP SUPPLY CHAIN According to CDP, a company’s average upstream emissions are around 11.4 times greater than their own direct operations, which is why supplier engagement is an important part of our climate action strategy. As a member of the CDP Supply Chain program, we invite suppliers ECOVADIS & SEDEX We focus our supplier engagement efforts on key suppliers that are critical to our business, reviewing the list annually as our supply chain evolves. We require that these suppliers be assessed through EcoVadis or Sedex (Supplier Ethical Data Exchange), two supply chain information platforms that focus on the areas of environment, labor and human rights, ethics, and sustainable procurement. We use Sedex to run reports on our suppliers’ ethical data, manage information on our own facilities and share information with our customers. In 2021, we achieved our legacy IFF internal target for supplier engagement by confirming that approximately 90% of legacy IFF business-critical suppliers18 suppliers have been screened via valid CSR assessments using environmental and social criteria (EcoVadis or Sedex), and 75% key strategic suppliers are considered responsible (that is, suppliers with assessment results in good standing with no significant noncompliances noted or corrective action plans in place). For heritage N&B, following an integration exercise to determine 78 Appendix Equity & Wellbeing Responsible Sourcing Transparency & Accountability Climate & Planetary Health Sustainable Solutions Our ESG+ Commitment Introduction\n",
      "the status and availability of corporate vendor assessments, we found that approximately 32% of total unique heritage N&B suppliers were assessed through EcoVadis or Sedex. Moving forward in 2022, this insight will serve as our baseline to help reduce that gap among heritage N&B suppliers. As part of our integration activities this year, we also hosted sustainable procurement trainings to ensure the understanding among IFF buyers of various social and environmental issues and how to integrate them into their procurement functions. For example, in 2021 we partnered with EcoVadis to host a three- part online training series for more than 100 IFF buyers about the EcoVadis platform, including guidance about supplier engagement and assessments. We also use EcoVadis to assess ourselves as a supplier to our customers. For the second time, we were awarded the 2022 EcoVadis Platinum medal (based on 2021 information), a selective designation indicating our placement among the top 1% of companies assessed by EcoVadis. TOGETHER FOR SUSTAINABILITY IFF is one of 33 members of Together for Sustainability (TfS), a global procurement- driven initiative that assesses and improves the sustainability performance of chemical companies and their suppliers. Based on the Ten Principles of the U.N. Global Compact aand the International Council of Chemical Association’s Responsible Care® principles, the TfS framework evaluates member performance through a shared infrastructure of robust, standardized assessments and audits, the results of which are made available to all members through an online platform. Sharing our supplier sustainability assessments and audits with all members lessens administrative burdens, leverages synergies, and avoids duplicate efforts for our suppliers. TfS assessments are carried out by EcoVadis and performance is assessed in the areas of management, environment, health and safety, labor and human rights, and corporate governance – in alignment with IFF’s Vendor Code. We combine the outcomes of these supplier-specific assessments with other criteria (such as country of manufacture) to conduct follow-up monitoring and determine supplier audit schedules. Since the TfS initiative began in 2011, more than 17,500 supplier sustainability evaluations have been conducted and shared under the TfS program, including 16,083 shared supplier assessments and 1,773 shared supplier audits. During 2021, 2,512 TfS suppliers documented sustainability improvements.

We also continued to work with suppliers on their corrective action plans identified through TfS audits. TfS enables member companies to work together by facilitating constructive dialogue regarding supply chain complexity, challenges, and opportunities. Specific initiatives are led and executed by TfS members through targeted work streams. Following the 2020 launch of Grow & Deliver (a 2025 strategy and roadmap focusing on the measurement of tangible impact through higher standards and collaboration), TfS launched two new programs in 2021 to increase impact. The Scope 3 GHG Emissions Product Carbon Footprint (PCF) program will provide a PCF guideline and sharing solution for the reduction of GHG emissions among TfS member companies, and the new Global Capacity Building platform – TfS Academy – provides learning opportunities for the shared supplier base and buyer communities of member companies. TfS also organized a series of interactive webinars in 2021 clarifying the EcoVadis process for assessments and the post- assessment trainings.

      "CERTIFICATIONS & CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT IFF strives to source materials that have been certified by credible, internationally recognized, third-party environmental and social responsibility certification programs. We partner with our suppliers and invest resources to achieve certifications for strategic supply chains. Underscoring our commitment to responsible sourcing, ingredient certifications support the conservation of natural resources and improvement in the livelihoods of farmers and workers involved in our supply chain. In recent years, we have expanded our offerings of certified ingredients. 81 Appendix Equity & Wellbeing Responsible Sourcing Transparency & Accountability Climate & Planetary Health Sustainable Solutions Our ESG+ Commitment Introduction\n",
      "COSMOS The COSMOS signature is a consumer guarantee for organic and natural cosmetics that defines a set of criteria for companies to meet to ensure the highest feasible sustainability practices in their retail products. The certification ensures environmentally friendly production processes in respect of biodiversity and human health. We are proud to help our customers reach their sustainability goals and commitments to consumers by contributing key ingredients to official COSMOS-approved retail products. As of the end of 2021, we have achieved COSMOS approval for 131 essential oils, absolutes and other natural extracts in our portfolio and we are continuing to increase this number over time. Organic & Vegan As more of our customers seek certified organic ingredients to use in their products, we are proactively addressing this demand by obtaining these certifications for many ingredients. We have three operating locations with organic certification and 69 certified organic products within LMR (see IFF Facility Certifications, page 212). We have 162 natural extracts in our portfolio that are certified by Expertise Vegan Europe, or EVE VEGAN®, an independent certification body dedicated to the conformity of vegan products and vegan farming. This voluntary label is recognized worldwide as guaranteeing products free of ingredients from animal origin (i.e., from breeding, slaughter, hunting or fishing) and not tested on live animals. The method, manufacturing conditions and packaging are also subject to controls prior to certification. For Life LMR certifies specific supply chains and facilities through ECOCERT’s rigorous For Life program. ECOCERT, a global specialist in the auditing and certification of sustainable practices, conducts inspections in more than 130 countries. For Life certification recognizes an organization’s adherence to sustainability criteria related to human rights and fair working conditions; ecosystems, biodiversity and sustainable agricultural practices; and betterment of local impact. LMR currently has 33 botanical families and 58 natural ingredients that are certified through the For Life program. The supply chains from which these ingredients originate include: rose from Turkey, vetiver from Haiti, geranium oil from Egypt, patchouli and ylang-ylang from Madagascar, jasmine and tuberose from India, patchouli from Indonesia, citronella from Togo and orris root and blackcurrant bud from France. Achieving these certifications is challenging, as it often involves years of work with growers and communities to improve their practices to meet the necessary criteria. LMR’s operational facilities in Grasse and Aumont- Aubrac, France, as well as Isparta, Turkey, are also For Life certified by ECOCERT. 82 Appendix Equity & Wellbeing Responsible Sourcing Transparency & Accountability Climate & Planetary Health Sustainable Solutions Our ESG+ Commitment Introduction\n",
      "STRENGTHENING BIODIVERSITY & COMMUNITIES Our commitment to responsible sourcing around the world means we strive to improve the environment and quality of life in the farming communities where we source, helping to make them more biodiverse, stable, resilient, and prosperous. In 2021, we continued to adjust activities, trainings, or social engagement opportunities as needed to accommodate important safety considerations related to COVID-19. We annually re-evaluate where our efforts and investments will create the most value and how we can continue to reach more people. Our work in Haiti, Indonesia, Madagascar, and India offers four examples. Moving Forward on Vetiver in Haiti IFF has been working to support the communities of our vetiver supply chain in Haiti since 2016, when we launched the pilot program, Vetiver Together™. In 2021, in cooperation with international development organization, Heifer International, and a development finance partner, we built on the success of that pilot by continuing the next phase of the initiative: Vetiver Forward, which was launched in 2020. This new three-year partnership seeks to support more than 3,000 independent smallholder vetiver farmers across six cooperatives that are part of our supply chain, facilitating improved access to high-value markets, technical services, and business training. Vetiver root requires a 12- to 18-month crop cycle for optimal oil content and the farmers that rely on it as a primary source of income are often under financial pressure to harvest the crop early, leading to low-quality oil and poor profits. The roots also play an important role in stabilizing the soil. Promoting improved harvesting practices can reduce erosion, protecting fertile land and water in the soil, while decreasing the risk of floods and landslides. To address these challenges, Vetiver Forward seeks to increase farmers’ access to agricultural inputs for alternative income streams, such as beans, corn, sorghum, and plantains, as well as livestock. In 2021, 500 farmers received animals (goats or chickens) to increase their livelihoods. An agroforestry component of the program – which includes six new tree nurseries– supports climate, soil health, and biodiversity objectives, enabling farmers to sell fruits as an additional income source. Additionally, farmers had access to six seed banks in 2021 where they could borrow seeds (corn and beans) and repay them after harvest. The earthquake in Haiti that took place on August 14, 2021, caused severe damage to the local community. The situation was made worse by aftershocks, tropical storm Grace, and frequent rainfall in the days and weeks following the earthquake. The Vetiver Forward project was paused from August to September 2021. During this time, IFF and our partners focused on emergency relief efforts by funding three-months of vouchers for IFF supplier’s employees and their families to access food, water, first aid supplies, and building materials. 83 Appendix Equity & Wellbeing Responsible Sourcing Transparency & Accountability Climate & Planetary Health Sustainable Solutions Our ESG+ Commitment Introduction\n",
      "certification in three main geographic areas (Bali, Sulawesi and Flores), where, to date, nearly 900 farmers have been For Life certified. In collaboration with a partner, we continued to drive producer engagement and empowerment through initiatives aligning income diversification with environmental restoration. In addition to addressing plastic waste management and sustainable firewood management, the program aims to enhance patchouli farming through the protection of local biodiversity. For example: •\t 85,000 trees – comprising 19 distinct species have been planted by farmers since 2019, restoring approximately 2,000 hectares. •\t Farmers in 39 participating villages were trained in 2021 on agroforestry practices. •\t Agroforestry models shared with the more than 500 farmers during the training included: – planting trees around patchouli parcels to demarcate borders, stabilize soil and create natural barriers against wind and pests – planting trees within patchouli parcels to promote shade, soil fertility and biodiversity – densely reforesting unproductive or degraded lands to regenerate soil and enhance biodiversity In 2021, we also kicked off a training for three groups of women in the community on home gardening – something that is already a part of many women’s daily tasks. The training focused on three main topics: seedling preparation, planting and maintenance, and harvesting – concepts that can also be applied to patchouli farming production. The program was well received by participants, and we will look to further scale this up in the future to reach more women and families. Sustainably Sourcing Vanilla in Madagascar Vanilla is primarily cultivated in Madagascar, where social, environmental, quality, and traceability challenges make the supply chain fragile. Though one of the largest vanilla exporting countries in the world, Madagascar is also one of the poorest. Vanilla cultivation, which requires pollination by hand, is a time consuming and labor-intensive process for independent smallholder farmers. Due to its location and isolation, it has tremendous biodiversity, but this is being threatened by slash and burn agriculture, primarily for rice cultivation. For these reasons, the objective of our vanilla program in Madagascar is to not only create a long-term and stable supply of sustainable and high-quality vanilla, but In addition to the natural disasters, political instability, security risks, the COVID-19 pandemic also continued to challenge Heifer International’s ability to implement planned activities locally. Despite these challenges, Vetiver Forward planned for new farmer trainings in targeted areas and various training sessions have already been held on livestock management and agricultural diversification. Out of the 3,000 farmers we are targeting for participation in the program, 836 (28%) have been trained as of the end of 2021, 314 of whom are women. Supporting Patchouli Farming in Indonesia Popular for centuries and commonly used in fine fragrances as well as consumer products, IFF predominantly sources patchouli oil from Indonesia, where the supply chain faces significant environmental, social, and economic challenges – from deforestation and plastic waste to the high number of intermediaries involved in the process that can hinder transparency. In 2021, we continued our shared value program to support patchouli farming communities in Indonesia through For Life 84 Appendix Equity & Wellbeing Responsible Sourcing Transparency & Accountability Climate & Planetary Health Sustainable Solutions Our ESG+ Commitment Introduction\n",
      "to implement a variety of socioeconomic activities for community members. We have arranged access to free healthcare with local doctors and hospitals for more than 3,000 producers and their families in the community. We also participated in rebuilding schools and safely distributing nearly 1,000 kits (comprised of notebooks, pens, pencils, and other school supplies) for the 2021/2022 school year to children of farmers. To support digitalization, financial inclusion, and better communication with farmers, phones were distributed and training on mobile banking was shared with 84% of farmers in the program. In addition to distributing bags of rice to the community, we also worked with approximately 150 women in a cooking initiative and distributed 420 improved cookstoves to households. •\t Preserving ecosystems To preserve biodiverse ecosystems in the region while expanding environmental awareness, we continued to expand our reforestation pilot program during 2021. Building on the two tree nurseries that we set up in 2019 (through which nine local managers oversaw the distribution of 2,000 seedlings to association members), this year we grew interest and participation and safely distributed more than 23,000 seedlings to support the livelihoods of the sourcing communities we work with while addressing the challenges of deforestation and biodiversity loss. In 2021, we strengthened our vanilla supply chain while improving the level of dignity for farmers and their communities and shifting behaviors to generate positive environmental impact. •\t Improving vanilla quality and productivity We continued to work closely with our farmers’ association, made up of more than 3,000 farmers in three cooperatives, approximately 25% of whom are female. Through the association, we are providing a variety of benefits and support, including training on good agricultural practices that support sustainable improvements for vanilla cultivation. Through these tools, the program aims to increase producer yields and achieve high-quality product which can be maintained in the long term. These steps are also supporting vanilla producers to remain Fair for Life certified. •\t Improving livelihood To support sustainable incomes for vanilla farmers – particularly during the quiet months of the annual campaign between pollination and harvesting – we continue to farmers to plant on their land. To date, 3,000 farmers from three cooperatives have planted more than 30,000 trees and received 76 days of training on agroforestry and ecosystems preservation. •\t Utilizing blockchain technology To enhance our vanilla supply chain in Madagascar through improved traceability and transparency, we continue to utilize blockchain to permanently create a timestamped and tamper-proof record (through the scanning of QR codes with mobile devices) of each vanilla bean’s journey through the supply chain – from the initial sale at the farm level, to the local cooperative, to processing and ultimately to its destination. Following the 2020 launch of this pilot program with a key customer and other innovation partners, we continued to develop the program in 2021, including capturing and securing crop-related data into the blockchain system. Looking ahead to 2022, we will scale up the program further in preparation for full implementation of the blockchain technology in this supply chain. 85 Appendix Equity & Wellbeing Responsible Sourcing Transparency & Accountability Climate & Planetary Health Sustainable Solutions Our ESG+ Commitment Introduction\n",
      "Enhancing Guar Farming Resiliency in India •\t Providing farmers with remunerative, profitable, and stable prices for guar – In addition to assuring farmers that they will be paid upon their delivery of guar, in 2021 the project also established and implemented a minimum price for guar monthly (for village predictability). Specifically, before the start of the sowing period in July, our supplier calculated and communicated to beneficiaries the quota of starting raw materials they will purchase and at what floor price, thereby helping to strengthen financial planning opportunities and build farmers’ capacity of savings and investment. •\t Enhancing the role of women and finding sustainable solutions to alleviate their workload – To highlight the importance of the role of female farmers in the field, nearly 200 farmers and community members participated in a program organized during the year to celebrate and promote the women’s important role on the farms. Guar gum is a cost-effective, all-natural, consumer and label-friendly thickening agent used in a variety of dairy and plant-based foods and beverages to control viscosity and build texture. It is an all-natural hydrocolloid from the guar bean and is considered a dietary fiber in certain regions, including the U.S. In 2021, IFF continued a three- year sustainable guar sourcing project that N&B launched in 2020. In partnership with our strategic guar supplier in India, the objective of the project is to enhance small farmers’ resiliency (particularly women), given the frequent challenge of insufficient and erratic rainfall in the region, as well as volatile guar market prices. This includes strengthening the availability of basic education for farmers and their families, while raising awareness about water, biodiversity, and gender equality. Key highlights from 2021 include: •\t Disseminating agroecological practices and promoting sustainable water management to strengthen farmers’ resiliency to insufficient and erratic rainfall – As of 2021, more than 1,200 farmers were trained in agroecology, including organic farming, pest management through natural fertilizers, livestock management, wild plants processing, mix cropping, crop rotations, agroforestry, tree planting as a way to retain water in the soil, vegetables production, and other topics. As a result, 35% of farmers trained have reported the adoption of different techniques they learned during these training sessions. Looking Ahead Over the next several years, our Responsible Sourcing program aims to scale up the partnerships with our suppliers, customers, and other stakeholders into responsible sourcing programs that will indirectly benefit more families and community members while strengthening the health of our planet. 86 86 Appendix Equity & Wellbeing Responsible Sourcing Transparency & Accountability Climate & Planetary Health Sustainable Solutions Our ESG+ Commitment Introduction\n",

      "NEW WORLD OF WORK As the COVID-19 pandemic extended into 2021, IFF focused on continuing to protect our employees and support our customers, including upholding our important role in delivering vital disinfection solutions and sanitation supplies to some of the world’s most important consumer products manufacturers. Building on the important work of 2020 in establishing a coordinated crisis response plan at the corporate level, some of the preventative and protective measures we took in 2021 to ensure the continued safety of our colleagues included: •\t Limiting large group gatherings, restricting non-essential travel, and maintaining enhanced internal sanitation and sterilization protocols at all manufacturing and creative center facilities •\t Implementing a hybrid work policy (including extending and formalizing work-from-home arrangements for non-essential employees) which had the benefit of limiting the number of people on site on any given day •\t Following Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidance on face coverings, shifting to requiring surgical masks or N-95 equivalents only, and providing same to onsite employees While we maintained these and other global guiding principles and safety expectations throughout the year, the evolution of the situation in 2021 and the emergence of vaccines also prompted us to decentralize our management approach and empower regions, sites, and local leadership teams to keep their sites safe by implementing the recommendations of their own governments and health authorities. This approach also proved to be effective in addressing the challenge of managing many new sites in countries with changing regulations following IFF’s integration with N&B. 90 Appendix Equity & Wellbeing Responsible Sourcing Transparency & Accountability Climate & Planetary Health Sustainable Solutions Our ESG+ Commitment Introduction\n",
      "The IFF COVID-19 Crisis Task Force that was first established in 2020 – made up of global, regional, and local crisis teams, along with representatives from HR, Legal, Operations, Corporate Communications, Information Technology, and our business teams – was also responsible in 2021 for refreshing all management guidelines for sites as the pandemic progressed and expectations related to vaccines and masking evolved. This included updating our Crisis Response Toolkit designed to provide site leaders with important guidance on preventing or minimizing COVID-19 workplace exposures through checklists, workplace sanitation expectations, notification protocols and guidance on contact tracing. The global data tracker that was created in 2020 for site leaders and HR business partners to track and monitor cases was also refreshed in 2021 to capture more relevant data, which continued to be reviewed by the Crisis Management Team and regional leaders on a weekly basis. COVID-19 cases (as defined by OSHA) were tracked and evaluated for work-relatedness separately according to OSHA guidelines and/or country requirements. All COVID-19 cases were determined to not be work-related. FUTURE OF WORK In addition to our ambition to lead our industry in terms of providing great products and services, we are also committed to being a great place to work, and the COVID-19 pandemic changed where and how we work forever. We learned how to collaborate in new ways and stay connected with our colleagues and customers while working remotely. With an emphasis on flexibility and agility of our workforce, in 2021, IFF formally adapted our culture to this new world through the launch of the Future of Work program, a new enterprise-wide hybrid work model to provide employees with remote work options. The goal of this way of working is to improve personal employee productivity, retain and attract key talent, and reduce our overall physical footprint in line with the environmental goals of our Do More Good Plan (e.g., reducing Scope 3 GHG emissions related to employee commuting and strengthening real estate portfolio management). We believe the many other benefits that can be realized with this work model are substantial, and moving forward, we are committed to continuously improving to create a best-in-class offering for our employees. Prior to the program launch, we completed a successful pilot program beginning in 2020, which included a legacy IFF employee survey and a pulse survey of N&B employees. Results of those engagement efforts indicated that 73% of surveyed employees from both heritage organizations preferred a hybrid work model where they have the flexibility to work on site and remotely. Among the benefits cited during the survey were a reduced commute, increased ability to focus, and a better work-life balance. Other insights from the survey included confirmations of no negative impact on employee engagement nor productivity during the work-from-home lockdown period (with many reporting an increase in productivity), and 91% of managers reported that collaboration with their customers was not impacted. We also considered the potential negative impacts of working from home on an individual’s mental and physical health in response to feelings such as isolation, or inability to “switch off from work.” 91 Appendix Equity & Wellbeing Responsible Sourcing Transparency & Accountability Climate & Planetary Health Sustainable Solutions Our ESG+ Commitment Introduction\n",
      "Taking these and other inputs into consideration, the program we launched in 2021 includes four hybrid work profiles: •\t Anchor: for employees whose work is 100% tied to a specific location and/or function and cannot be done remotely (five days per week at worksite) •\t Agile: for employees who regularly work with other team members onsite or require access to labs/technology at a dedicated site (two to five days per week at worksite) •\t Flex: for employees whose work is not based on specific physical ties to space and/or location, as they are collaborating with onsite teams less frequently (one to three days per week at worksite) •\t Remote: for employees with the ability to work anywhere because their work has no ties to the physical space and most collaboration can be done virtually (zero to one days per week at worksite) Employee work profiles were determined collaboratively between each employee and their manager, based on role and job function, preferences, team dynamics, and other leadership and morale considerations. To support employees in their new arrangements, we expanded digital workplace offerings for a single unified experience supportive of virtual meetings, video conferences, and calls; instant messaging; file sharing; project management; storing and sharing files; and common space collaboration. 2021 HYBRID WORK PROFILES BY EMPLOYEE CATEGORY (PERMANENT EMPLOYEES) ANCHOR AGILE FLEX REMOTE Executive management 0% 0% 100% 0% Upper management 36% 31% 24% 9% Middle management 34% 28% 22% 16% Junior management 43% 26% 20% 11% Operational 86% 6% 7% 2% Total 68% 14% 12% 6% 92 Appendix Equity & Wellbeing Responsible Sourcing Transparency & Accountability Climate & Planetary Health Sustainable Solutions Our ESG+ Commitment Introduction\n",
      "CULTURE & VALUES Building on the comprehensive culture program that we launched in 2020, we expanded the program in 2021 to reflect the refreshed set of values and culture principles to support our new purpose, vision, and organization as a combined company following the merger with N&B. We drew from the legacy cultures of IFF and N&B when developing our newly combined values and culture principles, and our inclusive validation approach included multiple steps to ensure comprehensive feedback from senior leaders and employees from both legacy entities, including interviews, focus groups, and a survey representing employees from five regions, three generations, and 15 business units/functions. Our five new values of empowerment, expertise, integrity, innovation, and responsibility are fundamental beliefs that guide individual behavior and clearly define what we stand for. Our culture principles represent our purpose, vision, and values in action: act as an owner; be agile; and collaborate and win together. We believe these refreshed values and culture principles emphasize even more prominently how critical it is for each employee at IFF to take ownership and to work with passion. CULTURE PRINCIPLES The Behaviors that Bring Our Purpose, Vision, and Values to Life Culture principles set a standard for how we work together inside and outside our walls. They help new employees and teams collaborate and assimilate more efficiently. Values guide how we hire, evaluate fit, and onboard new employees. They clearly define what our people stand for. Act as an Owner We take ownership and work with passion and integrity. Our teams are empowered to make decisions and help the entire organization thrive. We constantly push for progress and respond to the needs of our customers and the world with speed, skill, and creativity. Be Agile Our bond with our customers and colleagues powers innovation and our shared success. Collaborate and Win Together VALUES Fundamental Beliefs that Guide Individual Behavior Empowerment We make informed decisions, take action, and have the courage to hold ourselves accountable for the outcomes. Expertise We collaborate, applying our collective skills and diverse backgrounds to solve problems and achieve higher levels of performance. Integrity We are inclusive, treat each other with respect and work in a fair, honest, and ethical way. Innovation We harness our creativity to deliver essential solutions for our partners and the communities we serve. Responsibility We protect the health and safety of our people and preserve the communities where we work. 93 Appendix Equity & Wellbeing Responsible Sourcing Transparency & Accountability Climate & Planetary Health Sustainable Solutions Our ESG+ Commitment Introduction\n",
      "To support awareness of, and engagement with, our refreshed values and culture principles, in 2021 we rolled out a robust culture and values program with the objectives of attracting and retaining talent; motivating and engaging employees; and enabling business performance while celebrating our common culture and values in the workplace. We began with a series of senior leadership messaging and videos about why these values and culture principles are so important to our leadership team. To help translate these themes for employees, we also leveraged our existing culture ambassador program but expanded it by meeting our target of having nearly one ambassador at every site around the world. Following a carefully designed training and preparation program, this network of more than 200 culture ambassadors sponsored local voluntary site events (mostly virtual but in-person, where permissible) to facilitate dialogues that attracted a total of more than 11,400 participants during the year. Each executive team member also participated in at least one ambassador-led session to further engage with employees and demonstrate their support. We also created a series of central forums for ambassadors to connect with one another after their events to share information, best practices, and lessons learned, as well as offer encouragement. Finally, through a continuation of our online recognition program, employees were encouraged to recognize their fellow colleagues for jobs well done and in alignment with our new values and culture principles. To evaluate our progress and success of the culture and values program, as well as work toward continuous improvement, we measure overall performance, participation, and engagement, including through employee surveys. We also analyze the correlation between recruitment and retention statistics. Moving forward, our values and culture principles will also be embedded in the recruiting, performance management, and leadership development processes. EMPLOYEE SENTIMENT In November 2021, we launched a pulse survey to the entire organization with the objective of understanding overall employee sentiment following the merger with N&B, which achieved a response rate of approximately 40%. The survey was primarily comprised of three parts: feedback on the status and progression of the integration; preferred methods of communication and important topics to be communicated; and an assessment of employee satisfaction and engagement levels. Results from the survey and related analytical reports were evaluated by HR and the four business divisions, with action plans created as needed with business leaders. For example, in response to a question about how employees prefer to receive information, we learned that employees greatly value town halls and the opportunity to engage with senior leaders. As a result, more Executive Committee members hosted town halls in 2021 (often a mix of virtual and in-person, where permissible) and cascaded the practice throughout the organization. We also learned that while we have succeeded in achieving our initial focus of establishing a strong baseline understanding across the organization of IFF’s values, vision and purpose, there is now more work to be done in seeing IFF values brought to life in practice every day through continued engagement and behavior change. 94 Appendix Equity & Wellbeing Responsible Sourcing Transparency & Accountability Climate & Planetary Health Sustainable Solutions Our ESG+ Commitment Introduction\n",
      "TALENT MANAGEMENT Increasing our workforce following the merger with N&B brought with it many exciting opportunities, as well as various integration challenges. Among the biggest opportunities we saw was to leverage the best of both heritage N&B and legacy IFF from a talent perspective to support the end-to-end life cycle of all employees. We created a new Talent & Inclusion Center of Expertise (T&I CoE) focusing on the following key areas: Workforce Planning; Talent Analytics; Talent Acquisition; University Relations; Talent Management / Leadership Development; IFF University; Learning Solutions; and Diversity, Equity & Inclusion. Through the Workforce Planning team, for example, we collaborate closely with IFF business divisions and functions to support the talent needs they require to successfully execute on their business strategies, from expanded capacity requirements to securing team members with new capabilities or skill sets. We use these insights to build out clear workforce plans with the business units and help inform next steps for talent acquisition and retention. Our new Talent Analytics team also tracks T&I CoE metrics and KPIs that help inform HR and senior leader decision-making while supporting continuous improvement in our people processes. Data insights from this team’s predictive talent analytics capabilities also support workforce planning efforts, including understanding the most effective talent acquisition strategies and what differentiates group performance. IFF’s strategy for acquiring the highest quality talent is built around delivering the best possible candidate and hiring experience, while effectively managing the time and costs to recruit. Our Talent Acquisition team incorporates a personalized feedback process supported by industry-leading assessment tools, allowing us to do more proactive sourcing. New to IFF as of 2021 is a University Relations team, inspired by a similar structure that existed at N&B, which now serves as a dedicated resource to focus on the strength and diversity of our future pipeline. We measure our performance and identify areas for improvement in how we recruit, screen, and select best fit candidates. We also adapt our approach based on internal feedback, insights from our internal talent review process, KPIs as measured by our Talent Analytics team, or other indicators of program effectiveness (i.e., those gathered from outreach campaigns, town halls, or other employee engagements). Among the talent management challenges related to the integration was a significant amount of set up and pre-work that needed to be done prior to Day 1 of the merger (February 1, 2021) to achieve a seamless transition for all employees, such as updating or creating new systems to accommodate the expanded workforce and completing important preparations for onboarding and other resources. It was also a challenge to participate in new markets and talent pools following the merger that we did not previously compete for talent in, such as in the biotechnology, pharmaceutical, or nutrition spaces. While we may have already established ourselves as an employer of choice in some areas, in others we needed to build brand awareness and communicate our need for specialist skills in new ways with both internal and external stakeholders. Learn more about the opportunities IFF offers at our Careers page and our Job Opportunities page. 95 Appendix Equity & Wellbeing Responsible Sourcing Transparency & Accountability Climate & Planetary Health Sustainable Solutions Our ESG+ Commitment Introduction\n",
      "Performance Management & Reviews We maintained our focus on performance management during 2021, bringing all new employees following the merger into our personalized process. Managers and their direct reports work together to develop annual objectives that support core business priorities as well as professional development goals. We use an online performance management system that captures performance history, strengthens accountability, and enhances transparency. All permanent employees that were eligible for performance reviews in 2021 had access to the performance management system and all received performance reviews. Employees receive formal progress evaluations twice a year, creating opportunities for feedback to drive continuous improvement. Beyond those conversations, managers are encouraged to provide feedback throughout the year. The feedback process is further enabled by the implementation of various industry-leading assessment tools. Those targeted tools provide exceptional insights for managers, and when coupled with facilitation, elevate the performance of our employees and teams. In addition to regular performance reviews, IFF conducts multilevel internal talent reviews several times each year. Our Board recognizes that one of its most important duties is to ensure excellence and continuity in our senior leadership. This is partially accomplished by overseeing the development of executive talent and by planning for the effective succession of our CEO and other senior members of executive management. Our CEO and our executive officers are required to prepare detailed development and succession plans for themselves and for their direct reports on an annual basis. Those reports build upon similar reviews, occurring at multiple levels within IFF. As an extension of this, in 2021 we facilitated formal talent review discussions twice during the year, both between Executive Committee members and the CEO (to understand high-level needs at the divisional or functional level), and, for the first time, deeper into the organization with upper and middle management for all groups. The objective of this structured process at multiple management levels was to confirm existing capabilities versus needed critical skill sets, review hiring goals, and consider the diversity of succession plans, among other topics. 96 Appendix Equity & Wellbeing Responsible Sourcing Transparency & Accountability Climate & Planetary Health Sustainable Solutions Our ESG+ Commitment Introduction\n",
      "Learning & Development At IFF, we aspire to be the best place to learn and grow in the industry and we are continuously working to identify and develop IFF’s current and future leaders in support of the business strategy. For the first time in 2021, we formalized an IFF Learning Philosophy that guides our beliefs and approach to learning: •\t We believe in empowering IFFers to grow to their full potential. We make relevant learning accessible to all. •\t We learn for today and tomorrow to build meaningful careers and to bring innovative solutions to our customers and the world. •\t We are passionate about life-long learning. We engage in learning every day. •\t We believe that all of us develop through formal learning experiences, in the flow of work and from each other’s expertise. •\t We create a supportive work environment that allows IFFers to learn, experiment, and be their most creative. Career ladders are one way we provide an accessible global framework for vertical professional development and career planning. They are organized according to job function and tailored for specific commercial and technical positions in our business divisions. Clear expectations are outlined for specific roles at all levels, including the knowledge, experience, skills, competencies, performance expectations and criteria for success. In combination with our training programs, career ladders help employees manage their learning and development progress and provide a roadmap for building a successful career at IFF. Led by our Talent Management / Leadership Development team, another way we help all employees imagine what is possible in their career journeys in line with our Learning Philosophy is through IFF University, which we relaunched in 2021 as a comprehensive online hub with a revamped structure to meet the needs of the combined company. This corporate university platform is accessible to all permanent/full-time employees through our intranet and offers training in the form of professional learning tools, online classes, and development aids to help guide employees to our full portfolio of resources. Offerings include leadership development, creative schools, and IFF Academies customized by business unit or function. IFF Academies develop strategic functional skills, learning solutions, and capabilities to help businesses deliver on their vision and strategy, serving as vehicles toward upskilling and reskilling employees. Activities offered include instructional e-learning courses, conferences, seminars, lunch-and-learns, external speakers, and more. In short, the Academies serve as both training centers (to develop strategic functional skills and capabilities) and learning networks (to build new connections and create a culture of collaborative learning). IFF University is also supported by our Learning Management System (LMS), which we also relaunched in 2021 to allow employees to find and access hundreds of on-demand, instructor-led, in-person and virtual training modules that are accessible in multiple languages. Trainings may be consolidated under corporate oversight as well as managed at local, regional and/or global levels, in accordance with requirements or other specifications. The LMS is the primary IFF system for maintaining employee profiles, including a historic record of employee training accomplishments, which helps facilitate the performance management process, the talent review process, and legal compliance. Managers review training records 97 Appendix Equity & Wellbeing Responsible Sourcing Transparency & Accountability Climate & Planetary Health Sustainable Solutions Our ESG+ Commitment Introduction\n",
      "with employees during mid- and year-end performance cycles to confirm trainings in support of their development plans, allowing managers to make more informed decisions regarding employee assignments, moves, or promotions. One of the exciting ways our Learning Solutions team leveraged IFF University and the LMS in 2021 was through the launch of IFF’s first ever Global Learning Week, an opportunity to better understand the range of opportunities and experience available for employees to design and articulate their successful career journeys. During a five day period, more than 15,100 hours of learning was collectively achieved across 71 global and regional events. Many of the materials were made available through IFF University, where they could also be accessed and played back afterwards as well. The Week included senior leader panels, external speakers, and facilitated training across our four regions globally. LEADERSHIP PROGRAMS Because so many of our career tracks are unique to our industry, we provide a variety of blended professional opportunities tailored to specific careers. We look for appropriate educational backgrounds and expertise when hiring for these positions, and we have found ways to develop important skill sets in-house as well as in collaboration with well-respected educational institutions. •\t Leadership Development empowers participants to become forward-looking, inspiring, and capable decision-makers and agents of change through a variety of programs and partnerships. As part of this platform, we partner with INSEAD, one of the world’s leading graduate business schools, to help participants explore new business opportunities, new markets, and enhanced profitability models. •\t Management Development empowers our employees to take ownership and to work with passion and integrity. Our teams are empowered to make decisions, drive change, and to help the entire organization thrive. For example: – Management Essentials, our junior management training program, is our hands-on approach to management and leadership best-practices. Composed of self-paced courses and live group webinars, the training is conducted over two months and covers key concepts such as giving and receiving feedback, managing performance, and managing workplace conflict. In 2021, 400 learners participated in the program; a 400% increase in participation from 2020. – The People Leader program is designed for first-line supervisors, managers with direct reports and employees who are new to management. Participants spend six months building a foundation for understanding leadership while broadening their perspectives and expanding their internal networks. In 2021, 50 leaders participated in the program. – The Organizational Leader Program (OLP) is our senior manager program designed for “managers of managers.” The six-month program guides participants in shifting from strategy execution to strategy design, emphasizing a cross-functional mindset while still encouraging individual and team development. In 2021, 140 leaders completed the OLP; a significant achievement as OLP was not offered during 2020. •\t Business & Professional Programs include curricula that helps our employees innovate and excel by providing them with a consistent framework to continue their professional development. Our online learning resources enable an array of courses and trainings that can be leveraged virtually by individual employees around the world. 98 Appendix Equity & Wellbeing Responsible Sourcing Transparency & Accountability Climate & Planetary Health Sustainable Solutions Our ESG+ Commitment Introduction\n"

For example, we are proud to partner with the world’s premier perfumery school, ISIPCA (Institut Supérieur International du Parfum, de la Cosmétique et de L’aromatique Alimentaire) to offer a Masters in Scent Design and Creation, the first and only accredited program of its kind. Our Sensory University is designed for global sensory evaluators who make decisions based on odor, taste, and appearance to ensure quality control of our solutions. Learn more here. Our goal is to continue to grow these programs by expanding enrollment and access to educational tools that further support our employees. BENEFITS & WELLBEING IFF offers an array of competitive benefits to meet the diverse needs of our employees and their eligible dependents. From healthcare to holidays, our aim is to help our employees enjoy happy and healthy lifestyles, while maintaining a good work-life balance. We also recognize the importance of supporting employee wellbeing in different ways around the world. In the United States, for example, we offer a program that helps employees reach personal health goals and make improvements to avoid future health problems. Employees can learn vital information about their overall health by taking an assessment and participating in a biometric screening. They can then earn credit and rewards for completing program activities in support of improved health outcomes. We also continue to offer programs that support the flexibility and work-life balance of our employees, including the following: •\t Vacation Time: In addition to the observance of holidays throughout the year, we provide eligible employees time off based on their years of service. •\t Paid Time Off: We maintain a discretionary paid time off program for employees to deal with emergency situations and unexpected or unavoidable events. •\t Flexible Work Program: We continue to offer our global flexible work program that was first launched in 2018. The program offers two options for employees: Flex Time (a standard five-day workweek with a set schedule that includes core hours and untraditional start and end times) and Flex Week (a work schedule that compresses the standard number of hours in a workweek into fewer, longer days). The program goal is to help reduce employee stress caused by conflicting personal and professional priorities; increase job satisfaction, energy, and creativity; and allow opportunities for employees to pursue other interests, such as education or participation in community activities. This program is also complementary to the Future of Work program that was rolled out in 2021 (for more information on Future of Work, please see page 91). 99 Appendix Equity & Wellbeing Responsible Sourcing Transparency & Accountability Climate & Planetary Health Sustainable Solutions Our ESG+ Commitment Introduction\n",
      "DIVERSITY, EQUITY & INCLUSION We believe that each colleague’s unique lived experience is a value- add to our culture. When all individuals know that their full authentic selves belong, unfettered creativity is released, as demonstrated in our diversity, equity & inclusion (DE&I) vision: “Your Uniqueness Unleashes Our Potential.” We know there is no summit to reach, no finish line to cross, nor even a final destination when it comes to our journey to full inclusion. Rather, it is an ever-evolving process, and one that we remain committed to as we work to become the most diverse, equitable, and inclusive organization that is leading the way for our industry. To that end, we are dedicated to nurturing a truly inclusive and fair culture through the three pillars of our DE&I mission: •\t OUR PEOPLE represent the mosaic of the markets we serve and are empowered to transform the future •\t OUR SPIRIT nurtures an inclusive and fair culture where every voice is valued and heard •\t OUR WORLD embraces diversity of thought and strives to Do More Good, creating a better future for all INCLUSION The collective set of actions, norms, and processes that create a workplace where all individuals are welcomed, respected, supported, and valued. DIVERSITY Encompasses the mosaic of personal experiences, values, beliefs, and perspectives that arise from every individual’s unique makeup. EQUITY Recognizing the roadblocks that have impacted historically underrepresented groups in the workplace and the purposeful work to remove them. We also know the words “diversity,” “equity,” and “inclusion” can vary in meaning depending on the context in which they are used and in different cultures around the world. For this reason, in 2021, we developed a collaborative understanding that frames our journey, choices, and actions. 100 Appendix Equity & Wellbeing Responsible Sourcing Transparency & Accountability Climate & Planetary Health Sustainable Solutions Our ESG+ Commitment Introduction\n",
      "DE&I Governance We are proud to have an employee-led DE&I governance structure that ensures that the development and execution of our strategy has the greatest positive impact on all employees. Ultimate accountability for DE&I rests with the CEO and the CHRO, who approves the Global DE&I Steering Committee’s annual plan and strategy. Several other Executive Committee members, who report directly to the CEO, provide executive sponsorship for our eight global Colleague Communities (see page 109). Additionally, in October 2021 we established a Disability Inclusion Taskforce that comprises key decision makers from around the business to ensure we close the gaps in accessibility for People with Disabilities (see page 108). The Global DE&I Steering Committee oversees the work of our DE&I Center of Excellence (DE&I CoE), led by our Global Director of Diversity, Equity & Inclusion, who has the accountability and overall responsibility for our program. As a testament to the growing maturity of our program since it was created in 2017, the DE&I CoE added two full-time staff members in 2021: Global DE&I Communications & Platforms Lead and Global DE&I Project Management Officer & Reporting Lead. We have a Regional Inclusion Council in each of our five IFF regions that are responsible for identifying and delivering regional and locally specific DE&I activities while supporting global initiatives across each region. The Councils help to provide a source of feedback to the DE&I CoE and Global DE&I Steering Committee about key inclusion priorities at the local level. We use this input, along with other employee feedback received throughout the year, to evaluate the effectiveness of our DE&I approach and identify new opportunities for engagement. Following the N&B merger, understanding and combining two distinct heritage DE&I programs and steering committees was a challenge. However, there was significant drive and dedication among all teams to communicate openly with each other and harmonize both legacy IFF and heritage N&B DE&I activities into one as quickly as possible, utilizing the best of both to ultimately update and improve our platforms. Within the first month of integration, for example, our combined Global Steering Committee reviewed and approved the annual DE&I 2021 Plan, and we achieved a fully integrated program by the first half of the year – ahead of our target schedule. 101 Appendix Equity & Wellbeing Responsible Sourcing Transparency & Accountability Climate & Planetary Health Sustainable Solutions Our ESG+ Commitment Introduction\n",
      "DE&I 2030 Goals While we know that reaching full inclusion is an ongoing journey, we have goals to track our progress, hold ourselves accountable, and guide and assess the advancement of our program. To that end, by 2030, in alignment with the goals of IFF’s Do More Good Plan, we will ensure: •\t 50% women at all organizational levels, including the Board of Directors •\t 40% people of color in management roles in the U.S., with equitable representation in other markets globally •\t All global and local policies and practices are fully inclusive of LGBTIQ+ Colleagues, with a focus on Transgender inclusive healthcare •\t 5% of our workforce will be People with Disabilities and 100% of physical locations, internal and external technology, policies, and processes will be fully accessible for People with Disabilities. To achieve these 2030 goals, we must turn our words into collective action. We are by no means perfect, but through dedicated advancements, we are working hard to create safe spaces that empower employees to share their unique experiences and work toward affecting positive change. We draw strength from our diversity, and we are committed to creating safe environments for each of us to ask questions, respect answers, and appreciate one another’s contributions to our IFF culture. 102 Appendix Equity & Wellbeing Responsible Sourcing Transparency & Accountability Climate & Planetary Health Sustainable Solutions Our ESG+ Commitment Introduction\n",
      "Our Actions Globally, we focus on four primary DE&I themes and select external partners for each that are experts in their respective fields to guide us along our path. These collaborations allow IFF to use established methodologies in support of systemic positive change, while joining with like-minded companies and organizations to exchange best practices. GENDER PARITY To understand what it will take to reach our goal of 50% women at all levels of the organization, we must recognize the steps taken to reach where we are today. In 2019, for example, the percentage of women in middle management was 37%, which increased to 38% as of the end of 2020. Following the merger with N&B and the addition of more than 10,000 employees, the percentage of women in middle management for the combined company decreased to 36% in 2021. To continuously improve and achieve an upward trend on gender diversity for all employee categories, we have a renewed focus on recruitment, succession, and promotion efforts. While we admit we are not yet where we want to be, we have our North Star, and we are not slowing down until we achieve our goal. We continue to align with the U.N. Women’s Empowerment Principles, a set of seven tenets to advance and empower women, and provide equal treatment in the workplace, marketplace, and community. We have renewed and expanded our partnership with Economic Dividends for Gender Equality (EDGE), our global advisor on gender parity. EDGE holds a leading methodology and third-party evaluation and certification process to guide organizations on gender representation, pay equity, effective policies and practices, and the inclusiveness of an organization’s culture. EDGE sets the minimum threshold of targeting at least 30% of either gender at all levels of the organization. As of the end of 2021, IFF met that threshold for our global population (with women making up 36% of our workforce), but executive management did not meet that threshold, ending 2021 at 27%. 2021 GENDER DIVERSITY BY EMPLOYEE CATEGORY (Permanent Employees) ● Male ● Female 27% 36% 36% 47% 30% 36% 73% 64% 64% 53% 70% 64% EXECUTIVE MANAGEMENT JUNIOR MANAGEMENT UPPER MANAGEMENT OPERATIONAL MIDDLE MANAGEMENT GLOBAL 103 Appendix Equity & Wellbeing Responsible Sourcing Transparency & Accountability Climate & Planetary Health Sustainable Solutions Our ESG+ Commitment Introduction\n",
      "Gender representation is not the only way we assess our maturity in gender equality; understanding the gender pay gap is also vital to ensuring we are a fully inclusive employer. In alignment with our Global Equality Policy, our internal Principles of Equal Pay for Equivalent Work outlines our commitment to achieve gender balance and provide equal pay for equal work. In 2020, we were proud to achieve a Global EDGE Move Certification, which confirmed equal pay for equivalent work in 21 countries assessed. In 2021, we took steps to prepare for expanding the list of countries to be certified to 27, which will represent approximately 90% of our employee population. We conduct a pay-gap assessment twice per year by country and trainings with people managers to ensure gender bias is not a factor in annual compensation planning or decisions. In 2021, using the Bloomberg methodology, we determined that our global gender pay gap was 12% in favor of women.20 However, when analyzing gender pay gap by management level, we see a different story, with pay gaps in favor of male employees at the executive, middle, and junior management levels. While EDGE considers a pay gap less than 5% to be statistically insignificant, having any gender pay gap is unacceptable by our standards. IFF uses the EDGE Pay ToolTM to assess any possible gender pay-gaps, which uses a regression analysis that considers the variables of gender, tenure, and age, among others. Using this tool, we monitor our statistically significant unexplained gender pay gap and take corrective action when individual unexplainable gender pay gaps are identified. We also measure the Company’s proportion of female permanent employees across pay quartiles globally. Quartiles are determined by aligning all global employees’ compensation from highest to lowest and dividing the list into four equal cuts, with the highest compensated in the top quartile. In 2021, women made up 41% of the top quartile; 39% of the upper-middle quartile; 34% of the lower-middle quartile; and 30% of the lower quartile. We are encouraged that the breakdown of pay quartiles closely follows our representation numbers by management level. 20. All pay is calculated for full-time equivalent (FTE). Formula used is the difference between average male salary and average female salary divided by average male salary (all salary figures converted to USD via exchange rates as of December 31, 2021). 2021 GENDER PAY GAP BY EMPLOYEE CATEGORY 20 (Permanent Employees) ● Male ● Female Favored Gender 51% 4% 3% 1% 7% 12% EXECUTIVE MANAGEMENT JUNIOR MANAGEMENT MIDDLE MANAGEMENT GLOBAL UPPER MANAGEMENT OPERATIONAL 104 Appendix Equity & Wellbeing Responsible Sourcing Transparency & Accountability Climate & Planetary Health Sustainable Solutions Our ESG+ Commitment Introduction\n",
      "In short, we know we have more work to do to achieve full gender parity, but we are focused on continuous improvement. We were pleased to be listed on the Bloomberg Gender Equality Index for the first time, due in large part to our commitment to transparency in gender-related data disclosures.21 As we continue to move toward full gender parity over the course of 2022, we will roll out an Inclusive Talent Management training series that tackles removing unconscious bias at each stage of the employee life cycle, and we will also formalize a global family leave policy. Additionally, to further hold ourselves accountable to achieve our 2030 gender goal, all executive management will have 5% of their 2022 annual bonus tied to the success of meeting our internal gender target for 2022. RACIAL EQUITY Our steadfast and unequivocal position is that racism has no place in our organization, and we remain committed to working to identify and correct examples of institutional racism in our policies and practices. In 2021, our CEO continued to support the CEO Action for Diversity & Inclusion™ pledge to support more inclusive workplaces. IFF’s ethnic diversity by employee category in the United States has a mixed story of both success and opportunity for improvement. We are always working to continuously improve and our Do More Good Plan goal is to reach 40% people of color in management roles (executive, upper management, and middle management) by 2030. We define people of color (POC) in the United States as Asian; Black or African American; Hispanic or Alaska Native; Native American or Alaska Native; North African / Middle Eastern; and Two or More Races. As of 2021, we had 27.2% POC in executive, upper, and middle management roles. Specifically, in 2021 executive and upper management had POC representations of 36.4% and 41%, respectively, and a combined POC representation of 40%, but that does not include anyone who identifies as Black. Middle and junior management had POC representations in 2021 of 24.5% and 23.6%, respectively. We have representation from Asian and Hispanic or Latinx colleagues across all our management levels, but the highest percentage of Black colleagues are represented in our Operational employee category. We understand that to reach our goal of 40% POC by 2030 at all management levels, we will need to focus on maintaining and increasing representation at the executive and upper management levels while also increasing the acquisition, retention, and promotion rates of the middle and junior management levels.

Global LGBTI Standards of Conduct for Business in 2019, this year we also expanded our global reach on LGBTIQ+ equality through a partnership with Workplace Pride, a not for profit foundation dedicated to improving the lives of LGBTIQ+ people in workplaces worldwide. We signed the Declaration of Amsterdam, a 10-point “call to action” developed by Workplace Pride that outlines the “ideal” working situation for LGBTIQ+ workplace inclusion and sets clear goals that encourage LGBTIQ+ workplace inclusion wherever organizations have activities around the world. Through the Workplace Pride global benchmarking tool, we also assessed our LGBTIQ+ policies and practices on a global level in 2021. The analysis helped us better understand the inequities in our policies and practices, identify gaps in our own standards, and establish action plans to address these gaps. While we know we have more work to do, we are very proud of our recognition in 2021 by the Human Rights Campaign (HRC) as a Best Place to Work for LGBTQ Equality in the United States for the third consecutive year, and in Mexico for the second consecutive year, after receiving Corporate Equality Index scores of 100% for each country. Additionally, we were recognized in 2021 as a Top Employer for LGBT+ inclusion at the Bronze Award level in the India Workplace Equality Index, collectively organized by the Keshav Suri Foundation, Pride Circle, and Stonewall. As we continue our path toward full inclusion of our LGBTIQ+ colleagues, we will seek out other country level certifications to ensure our policies and practices are both globally consistent and locally relevant. 107 Appendix Equity & Wellbeing Responsible Sourcing Transparency & Accountability Climate & Planetary Health Sustainable Solutions Our ESG+ Commitment Introduction\n",
      "We are proud members of the Disability:IN’s Inclusion Works program, a coalition of 98 companies which shares customized guidance and best practices from a team of disability inclusion experts on creating an inclusive culture and a sustainable recruitment strategy. In 2021, our Global Director of DE&I served on a Disability:IN advisory panel to expand the U.S.-based Disability Equality Index globally. As part of this effort, IFF participated in a pilot program to expand the Global Disability Equality Index in Brazil, France, and China in 2021. Looking ahead to 2022, we will also participate in the official rollout of the framework to 26 countries outside of the United States. While we are pleased to have been named for the second consecutive year as one of the 2021 Best Places to Work for Disability Inclusion by Disability:IN after again scoring 100% on the Disability Equality Index, we know we are just at the start of our journey to be to a fully accessible employer for people with disabilities. For this reason, we launched an internal Disability Inclusion Taskforce in 2021 comprised of senior leaders from across the business. The team uses Disability:IN’s Disability Equality Index as a framework to identify the gaps we must close to reach full accessibility for our colleagues with disabilities. DISABILITY INCLUSION Having a common definition of disability is important. As noted in the book, Demystifying Disability: What to Know, What to Say, and How to Be An Ally, published in 2021 by author and disability rights activist, Emily Ladau, there are many formal definitions of disability, but they often focus on the limitations and inabilities of individuals rather than understanding the unique potential each disabled individual has to offer the world. The term ‘disability’ is ever-evolving and can mean something different to each person that identifies as having a disability. From her own perspective, Ms. Ladau states, “After years of existing in this body of mine, my definition of disability is: a state of being; a natural part of the human experience.” At IFF, in alignment with our Global Equality Policy, we are committed to becoming a fully accessible employer of choice globally for people with disabilities. This includes expanding our representation of disabled employees, our technology accessibility, and our culture of inclusive leadership. To ensure that disability inclusion remains among IFF’s business-critical priorities, our CEO continued to support The Valuable 500 during 2021, a global movement and pledge to put disability on the business leadership agenda. 108 Appendix Equity & Wellbeing Responsible Sourcing Transparency & Accountability Climate & Planetary Health Sustainable Solutions Our ESG+ Commitment Introduction\n",

      "COLLEAGUE COMMUNITY 2021 HIGHLIGHTS We are proud of the many advancements our colleague communities made during 2021. Together, they worked diligently to make IFF a more inclusive and welcoming environment where uniqueness is both acknowledged and celebrated. Even in the height of the ongoing global pandemic, our communities utilized the virtual nature of the new way of doing business to reach more employees than ever before. To advance the overall platform and strengthen the relationship between Executive Sponsors and Colleague Community leadership teams, we created a new Executive Sponsorship Guide, which better defines the role of Executive Sponsor and serves as a helpful resource to steer colleague communities toward successful engagements.

      "ENVIRONMENT, HEALTH & SAFETY reporting, the EHS team identified key trends and training priorities, as well as competency expertise needed for continuous improvement. For example, we realized reporting was done differently in both heritage organizations and it was important to align our policies, definitions, and procedures to have a globally consistent system. We are pleased to report that we are implementing a world-class software solution to harmonize and strengthen our reporting and investigation, which will allow our leaders to see data on a timely basis and clearly identify trends to proactively prevent future incidents. As the COVID-19 pandemic continued in 2021, we continued to focus on protecting our employees and supporting our customers. For more information on how IFF managed COVID-19 related workforce safety, please see page 90. Another important way we support Equity & Wellbeing across IFF is our commitment to zero injuries, zero incidents, and 100% compliance, as nothing is more important than the health and safety of our people and the communities where we operate. Ensuring that our working environments are safe is an important part of everyone’s job at IFF. In 2021, we published and communicated our new Global Environment, Health & Safety Policy for the combined company, which demonstrates our commitment to maintaining a safe work environment for our employees, business partners, contractors, consultants, and temporary employees or secondees. In support of this Policy, we provide leadership guidance and resources, including our comprehensive Environment, Health & Safety (EHS) management system, which covers all employees and contractors for activities at sites globally. Employees, contractors, and visitors are expected and encouraged to uphold all IFF’s policies, report any incidents, and suggest opportunities that will improve the safety of work sites. Our approach for reporting EHS incidents and the criteria we use for corporate tracking is based on U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) standards. In addition to complying with all local regulations, our pursuit of excellence and best practice guidelines drive us to go beyond regulations to keep our people and facilities safe and environmentally friendly. For incident tracking, we used reporting systems from both legacy organizations during the year, and the information was manually combined to report safety performance for the combined company. Local teams report safety performance to the corporate global EHS team, who reviews all incidents and works with local teams to support investigations and resolve issues as appropriate, including identifying corrective actions and safety improvement plans. Based on metrics and insights from safety 112 Appendix Equity & Wellbeing Responsible Sourcing Transparency & Accountability Climate & Planetary Health Sustainable Solutions Our ESG+ Commitment Introduction\n",
      "Strategy & Approach In alignment with the Do More Good Plan, IFF is committed to continuously improving our safety program by striving for an incident-free workplace and achieving world-class safety performance. Toward this end, we uphold a set of policies, protocols, and programs in three key areas: governance, training, and culture. GOVERNANCE IFF’s safety ambitions are directly related to the strength of the governance and organizational structures we have in place that will position us for success. In line with best practices, we work to equally engage senior managers, middle managers, first line supervisors, and safety professionals in attaining EHS excellence, according to clearly defined and executed roles, responsibilities, and activities. Specifically, within each of IFF’s divisions and globally, the following roles are responsible for maximizing our performance, including: •\t Senior managers / leaders: individuals at the top of line management, e.g., Vice Presidents (VPs) and Directors of Operations •\t Middle managers: those who oversee the functions of employees who are at risk, e.g., Site Managers •\t First line supervisors: those who direct the activities of at-risk personnel •\t EHS professionals: those who support line management with their subject matter expertise In short, senior managers and leaders create our vision for safety excellence (including establishing the culture for safety), while middle managers facilitate the execution of this vision, and first line supervisors execute it. EHS professionals at all levels of our organization support and enhance this process by providing subject matter expertise, policies, tools, and training to enable line management to achieve our collective vision of world class safety performance. LINE MANAGEMENT ACCOUNTABILITY Ultimately, the Executive Vice Presidents (EVP) of each function at IFF are accountable for the safety of their employees. For example, as our manufacturing facilities are a key focus area for employee safety and environmental compliance, our EVP of Operations is accountable for all Operations employees (approximately 16,000 in the combined company) and facilities. In turn, the VPs of each manufacturing division are accountable for the safety of the employees in their area, as well as compliance to applicable environmental and safety regulations. Site managers and first line supervisors are responsible for implementing safety procedures at their locations, and they are held accountable for their work group performance and actions; meeting safety objectives; and the correction of any safety- or environmental-related incidents that may occur. They also lead key aspects of safety rituals like communicating expectations, incident investigations, conducting audits, and assessing workers compliance. Finally, all employees are responsible for following the procedures and direction from their first line supervisor. To ensure all employees are following IFF’s rigorous standards, meeting corporate requirements, and culturally acting in a safe manner, the local teams conduct proactive safety observations, near miss reporting, and self-assessments (or first party audits). Various external site audits are also conducted during the year to provide additional support and verification of our processes. 113 Appendix Equity & Wellbeing Responsible Sourcing Transparency & Accountability Climate & Planetary Health Sustainable Solutions Our ESG+ Commitment Introduction\n",
      "RESPONSIBILITIES OF EHS PROFESSIONALS The global corporate EHS team, who reports to the Vice President, Global Sustainability & EHS, is made up of members of an EHS Center of Excellence (EHS CoE) and a team of divisional / regional EHS & Sustainability (EHS&S) leaders. This new structure was established in 2021 to further support our vision of achieving an incident-free workplace where we Commit to Zero: zero injuries, zero incidents and 100% compliance. Among other areas of expertise, the EHS CoE supports the business through the sharing of expertise in workplace safety and industrial hygiene, environmental stewardship and remediation, process safety management and fire safety. The team is responsible for EHS systems, training, and improvement, as well as auditing and compliance. EHS&S leaders for each of IFF’s business divisions and regions help implement and customize EHS CoE policies at facilities around the world based on local needs. They deploy consistent global policies, procedures, and systems to support IFF’s line managers, EHS and Operations professionals and employees. EHS&S leaders are also responsible for the sharing of best practices and support global harmonization of programs across all divisions and regions. Together, the CoE and EHS&S leaders are responsible for the deployment of consistent global policies, procedures, and systems to support our line managers, employees, and operations. The EHS professionals at each facility are guided by the EHS&S divisional / regional leaders to provide onsite support to line managers throughout the world. TRAINING EHS training for employees is managed at the site level, with each facility customizing safety and environmental programs based on both local requirements and global policies. Mandatory training is held for EHS managers and teams. The topics are based on key safety priorities and reflect EHS best practices and regulatory requirements. Training is conducted monthly on specific EHS topics driven by the EHS CoE and divisional / regional leaders. For example, in 2021, we integrated two policies from the legacy organizations into a new internal Global Incident Management Policy for the combined company with the objective of establishing a uniform method of reporting and classifying incidents, conducting investigations, and managing work-related incidents. Aligning with the expectations of the Policy will ensure that incidents are consistently reported and documented in accordance with IFF and local regulatory requirements, root causes of incidents are determined, and corrective actions are developed and tracked to completion. While site line management and EHS professionals are jointly responsible for incident management, it is important that all IFF employees and contractors be familiar with related key concepts, including when to report incidents. Toward this end, we established new tools and prepared training materials to support our teams in this process. As a next step in 2022, we will launch a mandatory online Global Incident Management Policy overview training through IFF’s integrated learning solutions platform. In parallel, we launched a new online incident investigation tool in 2021 to determine the root causes of an incident within a systematic process, and we will continue working toward full implementation. We also established a series of demonstrations and virtual training sessions for approximately 50 EHS line managers on the new investigation tool to support IFF personnel worldwide with the knowledge and expertise they need to fully utilize it. Once trained, the system guides investigators to identify fixable root causes of human errors and equipment failures that may cause incidents related to safety, quality, and reliability, among others. Further use of the method will assist IFF sites in developing effective corrective actions to prevent recurrence of incidents. 114 Appendix Equity & Wellbeing Responsible Sourcing Transparency & Accountability Climate & Planetary Health Sustainable Solutions Our ESG+ Commitment Introduction\n",
      "CULTURE Instilling a strong and proactive safety culture characterized by awareness and communication is vital to improving our performance over time. During the second quarter of 2021, the global EHS team joined other teams within the IFF Operations organization to launch the Integrated Operations Core Principles campaign, which emphasizes the four important ways we continuously “Find a Better Way for Our Customers” in the areas of safety, quality, sustainability, and integrity. This internal campaign helped to establish a consistent message across IFF’s expanded operational footprint while driving increased awareness about stakeholder expectations for a standard of excellence in these four areas. (For more information, see page 132). With the Operations Core Principles as a foundation, we worked to define, measure, evaluate, and strengthen safety culture as part of our integration work. For example, the global EHS team launched and implemented the Safety Focus Program in 2021 to assist sites with improving their safety performance. The Program provides support and assistance to sites through a collaborative approach and consists of two parts, a Site Buddy initiative and “Fresh Eyes” visits. •\t Site Buddy: An opportunity to assist the identified safety-focused site on their safety improvement journey by connecting the site managers and local teams with a line manager and EHS professional from a nearby site that has a mature, well-developed safety culture. By establishing this safety sharing relationship, the program provides the maturing site with an experienced “Safety Buddy” contact for mentorship, questions, and discussion, as well as an outlet to share incidents, best practices, and expertise. •\t Fresh Eyes: A visit to an identified safety- focused site by its designated Site Buddy and a global EHS team leader to discuss safety culture. Visits consist of collaborative discussions, site tours to identify strengths and areas of opportunity, and an assessment of the site’s safety culture, after which actions are identified for improvement. 115 Appendix Equity & Wellbeing Responsible Sourcing Transparency & Accountability Climate & Planetary Health Sustainable Solutions Our ESG+ Commitment Introduction\n",
      "EHS Performance IFF’s safety performance has continued to improve over time as we have expanded critical safety best practices across all sites globally. Line management continuously works with the global EHS team to assess safety metrics and identify synergies, gaps, and opportunities to further strengthen our safety performance in all locations. In 2021, the legacy IFF Total Recordable Incident Rate (TRIR) was 0.79 (a 17% decrease from 2020) and the Lost Time Incident Rate (LTIR) was 0.36 (a decrease of 18% from 2020). As of 2021, a new baseline was created for the combined company. As such, this will be the last year we are reporting performance against legacy IFF. Following the merger with N&B, a key area of focus for the year was to also understand the safety performance for the combined company. Through data analysis (i.e., incident trends, internal and external audit results, site risk evaluations, and management systems performance), benchmarking, and re-baselining activities, we better understood our strengths, gaps, and opportunities. We created a set of safety KPIs from the “best of both” organizations that allowed us to track safety performance monthly. As integration progressed during the year – including the establishment of the new organizational structure and EHS strategy – our internal tracking systems noted a positive monthly incident trend beginning in September 2021. Our combined company 2021 TRIR and LTIR for the year was 0.63 and 0.24, respectively. Achieving these results during the challenges of the integration and an ongoing pandemic speaks to the remarkable strategic steps taken by many teams across the organization to strengthen IFF’s safety culture and drive progress toward our vision of becoming a world-class safety leader. We also expanded our focus on process safety during 2021, integrating American Petroleum Institute (API) Recommended Practice 754 (Process Safety Performance Indicators for the Refining and Petrochemical Industries) into the previously described Global Incident Management Policy for the combined company. We also included usage of improved root cause failure analysis on Tier 1 and Tier 2 incidents via the online incident investigation tool. Sharing and learning from these incidents will be enhanced using common tools and strengthened networks which were designed in 2021 and are currently being implemented. Moving forward, we will develop a unified Process Safety Management Program to manage these risks for the combined company, including standardized tools and risk reduction methods. To keep continuously improving our program, in 2022, we will work to include employee training on incident management; launch the incident management tracking system; update and integrate additional core internal EHS policies; and continue to embed the new IFF safety culture across the combined company in a consistent and cohesive way. The next several years will represent an important transition period during which we will continue to focus on strengthening the three critical areas of safety governance, training, and culture toward our vision of being a world-class leader in safety and environmental stewardship. 26% 18% 18% 10% 17% 17% 4% 7% 2021 LOST TIME INCIDENTS (COMBINED COMPANY) Incident Source ● Trips/Falls ● Chemical Exposure ● Strains/Sprains ● Burns ● Struck by Objects / Impact / Contact ● Cuts ● Other 116 Appendix Equity & Wellbeing Responsible Sourcing Transparency & Accountability Climate & Planetary Health Sustainable Solutions Our ESG+ Commitment Introduction\n",

To measure our progress while holding ourselves accountable in meaningful and measurable ways, we have annual ESG-related performance targets for EC members, which are cascaded throughout the organization and linked to performance and compensation. Some management roles with specific ESG-related responsibilities have compensation more directly tied to progress against ESG targets. In 2021, we announced our 2030 Do More Good Plan goals to launch ESG metrics tied to executive compensation and expand oversight for ESG at the Board of Directors level. IFF has issued an annual, standards-adherent sustainability report since our first reporting year in 2010. The CEO, who also serves on the Board of Directors, is responsible for reviewing and approving our ESG+ Report, including our material topics, and the EC also reviews and approves this report prior to its publication. 122 Appendix Equity & Wellbeing Responsible Sourcing Transparency & Accountability Climate & Planetary Health Sustainable Solutions Our ESG+ Commitment Introduction\n",
      "ETHICS & TRANSPARENCY To establish a common approach to upholding the highest standards of honesty and integrity, and in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations, in 2021, we focused on the integration and harmonization of a refreshed compliance program. This included a harmonized Code of Conduct and relevant policies, and global communications about Ethics & Compliance topics and enterprise training sessions for senior leaders and all employees. As a first step, to set the ethical tone for our organization and serve as a compass outlining the general workplace standards and policies, we refreshed our Code of Conduct (“Code”) as of February 1, 2021. Available in 25 languages on the IFF Policy Center, the Code not only summarizes our policies on important topics such as anti-bribery and corruption, workplace safety, protecting confidential information, and diversity, equity & inclusion, but also includes scenarios about ethical dilemmas that employees may encounter throughout their careers. The values, expectations, and practical guidance found within the Code form the basis of how we expect IFF employees to conduct themselves. All IFF employees, including our Executive Committee, temporary employees, and contractors are responsible for reviewing, understanding, and complying with the Code and IFF’s policies and procedures. Employees receive annual awareness training on the Code (via a mix of in-person sessions, online courses, and webinars) and other internal communications, such as intranet articles, corporate email alerts and town hall meetings. This mandatory Code training campaign requires each employee to acknowledge receipt of, and adherence to, the Code. During 2021, as part of our integration process, we launched an extensive Code training and certification campaign for the combined company. Through multiple global and local touchpoints, including companywide email reminders and onsite meetings, we are proud to report that we achieved a 99.7% training and acknowledgment completion rate among all employees. In addition to the Code, all directors are required to comply with the Code of Conduct for Directors (amended as of January 2021) and all officers are required to comply with the Code of Conduct for Executive Officers (amended as of January 2022). Through similar online and live training methods and internal communications channels, we seek to ensure that employees understand other important compliance topics, including anti-corruption, workplace harassment, reporting concerns, information security, political contributions, international business transactions, and use of company assets. In 2021, we updated and translated into other languages several internal compliance policies available to employees on our intranet, including our Conflict of Interest Policy, Insider Trading Policy, and Confidential Information & Trade Secrets Policy. We also refreshed our Anti-Bribery Policy, which prohibits the giving of anything of value to a government official or any other person to influence that person’s decisions to help the Company obtain or retain business or gain an unfair advantage. In an accompanying campaign, we launched a reminder on appropriate gift giving and receiving around the holidays in December 2021. 123 Appendix Equity & Wellbeing Responsible Sourcing Transparency & Accountability Climate & Planetary Health Sustainable Solutions Our ESG+ Commitment Introduction\n",
      "IFF SpeakUp Hotline An effective compliance program relies on IFF being alerted to potential violations of the Code and the law, or any other issues that might compromise the health and wellbeing of our employees or the reputation of IFF. Anyone (internal or external to IFF, including community members) who has knowledge of potential misconduct, unethical activity or violations of the Code, IFF policies, procedures and/or applicable laws and regulations – or anyone who has knowledge of attempts to conceal such activity – must promptly “SpeakUp” using one of the following channels, as described in our “SpeakUp: Reporting Concerns & Non-Retaliation Policy:” •\t In-person to a manager/supervisor or a member of IFF’s Human Resources, Legal or Ethics & Compliance teams •\t Email to IFF’s Global Ethics & Compliance team at compliance@iff.com •\t Online using the iff.com/speakup web- based reporting tool, which is hosted by a third-party service provider and available to employees and business partners worldwide •\t Phone/hotline using the telephone numbers listed at iff.com/speakup, which permit calls in more than 25 languages, 24 hours a day, 365 days a year When making a report online, individuals will have the option to request anonymity if allowed under local law. IFF strictly forbids reprisal, retaliation, or subsequent discrimination against any person who in good faith raises a concern or reports possible misconduct. A challenge we addressed during the year was to ensure awareness of all SpeakUp channels and the case management system among new employees from heritage N&B sites. We undertook a concerted effort to communicate widely and consistently to all employees and sites about how to reach the Compliance Office and how to use available SpeakUp resources. This included leveraging the intranet to outline compliance expectations, as well as targeted communication campaigns, distribution of hotline posters at sites, and trainings on report investigation for local HR and Legal teams. IFF takes all reports of potential violations or misconduct seriously and is committed to reviewing and investigating them. Violations of the Code, IFF policies and all applicable laws and regulations – and attempts to conceal violations – may result in disciplinary action up to and including termination of employment. In 2021, 208 reports of potential violations of the Code of Conduct were reported, of which 49 were substantiated or partially substantiated. Please note that some substantiated or partially substantiated cases may have been initiated in a prior year. Reports may relate to (amongst other issue types) employee relations issues, the potential misuse of corporate assets and conflicts of interest. 124 Appendix Equity & Wellbeing Responsible Sourcing Transparency & Accountability Climate & Planetary Health Sustainable Solutions Our ESG+ Commitment Introduction\n",
      "Political Contributions IFF encourages all our employees to be involved in their communities and to be politically and socially active citizens. All political activity on behalf of IFF, including all lobbying activities, must receive prior clearance from Ethics & Compliance or Legal. As outlined in our internal Political Contributions Policy (refreshed as of February 1, 2021), IFF strictly prohibits direct or indirect contributions by the Company to any political campaign or political organization, as well as the reimbursement of any such contribution made by an employee. IFF does not permit the use of employees’ working time or other company resources or assets for these purposes nor does IFF permit employees to post or distribute materials on IFF property or to solicit other employees while working. Our internal Political Contributions Policy does not prohibit IFF from becoming a member of a trade association that may, at times, make political contributions on its own accord, but these contributions must not be made on IFF’s behalf. We participate in industry and customer trade associations that coordinate advocacy and communications on public policy issues related to our business. We work through both industry trade associations and through our customers’ trade associations. There are no significant differences between our industry lobbying efforts and stated policies and IFF’s goals or public positions.

      "Managing Challenges IFF has a fragrance ingredients manufacturing site in Jacksonville, Florida, U.S. Historically and prior to October 2020, IFF received complaints about our facility in Jacksonville from very few residents, which were addressed promptly. So, in October 2020 when an increase in odor complaints to the City of Jacksonville began, IFF investigated each complaint and started working with the City of Jacksonville and the Florida Department of Environmental Protection to help identify the source of the odors. We engaged environmental experts to conduct a scientific review and full evaluation of the odor complaints and IFF’s facilities. In December 2020 and October 2021, the City of Jacksonville issued citations to IFF. As part of our response to the City, we shared the results of the environmental expert study that had been conducted, which concluded that IFF is not likely the source of the odor complaints at issue. We also shared the results with residents during a town hall meeting and community discussion, which was also attended by state and local officials. In March 2021, IFF28 accepted service of a Federal Court complaint brought by residents of Jacksonville, Florida, alleging public and private nuisance and negligence, and claiming our Jacksonville plant emitted noxious odors. On May 18, 2021, we28 filed a motion to dismiss all claims of the lawsuit. On July 15, 2021, the Federal Court dismissed the lawsuit for lack of jurisdiction. In January 2022, we learned that the same plaintiffs filed a near-identical lawsuit in Florida state court, naming only IFF Chemical Holdings, Inc. as a defendant. We accepted service of the complaint in March 2022. IFF continues to work together with the City of Jacksonville to find solutions to minimize any odor from our facility. As the investigation continues, we remain committed to ensuring our environmental, health and safety practices are best-in-class, in compliance with all laws, and that we are operating with integrity as an employer, community member, and good neighbor. As part of our stakeholder engagement process with Jacksonville residents, we have created the following website to provide informational resources and to welcome the submission of feedback and inquiries: https://iffjaxcommunity.com/. 126 28. The Complaint originally named two defendants: (1) International Flavors & Fragrances Inc. and (2) IFF Chemical Holdings, Inc. The Plaintiffs then agreed to voluntarily dismiss International Flavors & Fragrances Inc. from the lawsuit. Then, because it was the lone defendant, IFF Chemical Holdings, Inc. filed the motion to dismiss.

      "RISK MANAGEMENT Through a robust risk oversight structure characterized by a division of responsibility, we believe we have established the most effective approach for addressing risk management at IFF that allows for open communication between the Board, its committees, and management. Our Board is actively involved in the oversight of risks that could affect our Company and is responsible for overseeing and reviewing with management the Company’s enterprise-wide risks and the policies and practices established to manage such risks. The Board receives regular updates and reports from management on the Company’s risk during its committee meetings and at the full Board meetings. Each of the Audit, Human Capital & Compensation, Nominating & Governance, and Innovation & Sustainability Committees are responsible for the oversight of risks relevant to its function and regularly reports to the Board. Specifically, the Board and its committees focus on operational risk, financial risk, regulatory risk, litigation risk, cybersecurity and information security risk, tax risk, credit risk, liquidity risk, human capital risk, sustainability risk, compliance risk, as well as our general risk management strategy, and how these risks are being managed. Our enterprise risk management (ERM) program is designed to identify and assess our global risks and to develop steps to mitigate and manage risks. As part of our risk management practices, IFF has established a management risk committee chaired by the CFO and General Counsel and made up of key members of the Company’s management to integrate global risk activities (including cybersecurity, compliance, business, human resources, and crisis management) and to ensure appropriate prioritization of resources and alignment across the Company.

      "Crisis Management Like any global company, IFF faces unexpected events that can disrupt our operations. To combat this risk, we have a comprehensive internal Global Crisis Management Plan that outlines preparation for and responses to emergency situations that may imperil the safety of our employees, customers, facilities, operations, or reputation. In 2021, we harmonized our Global Crisis Management Plan into one updated version reflective of the combined company by reviewing and integrating the approaches of both heritage N&B and legacy IFF. We have Crisis Management teams in place to ensure that situations are handled quickly and effectively by subject matter experts trained on IFF’s Global Crisis Management Plan. Membership on these teams is verified and updated on a regular basis, and all new team members are required to complete training on the Global Crisis Management Plan. For example, in 2021, with so many new sites, employees, and roles, we refreshed the membership of all teams to ensure proper representation and expertise. We currently have more than 400 members on the company- wide Crisis Management team, including the global team (comprised of Executive Committee members and select functional leads); regional teams (each led by a Chief Crisis Officer and comprised of representatives of each function); and local teams (led by the country manager and site leaders). We rolled out the new integrated Crisis Management Plan to all team members and created a global training to ensure each member has the knowledge and contact information they need to effectively manage a crisis. Depending on the crisis or situation, task forces or sub-teams may be set up to effectively manage and communicate IFF’s response strategy. In 2021, amidst the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, the COVID-19 Crisis Task Force that had originally been set up in 2020 (comprising global, regional, and local crisis teams) continued to meet on a regular basis to ensure full organizational alignment and to liaise directly with our Executive Committee, who were involved in all critical decision- making regarding response strategies.

      "Information Security At IFF, defending our organization against today’s increasing and persistent cyber threats is of utmost importance. Our Chief Information Officer (CIO) is responsible for delivering on the Company’s global information technology (IT) strategy and the digital technology transformation program, as well as overseeing infrastructure, data, application delivery, and end user services. Information Security (InfoSec) is led by the Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) and governed by the InfoSec Steering Committee (comprised of representatives from all business units and corporate functions), including the InfoSec Governance Review Board (comprised of the IT leadership team). InfoSec’s mission is to design, implement, and maintain a program that protects the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of IFF. The CIO and CISO provide regular updates on IT and information security initiatives to the Board, including the Audit Committee. In 2021, as part of the integration following IFF’s merger with N&B, we continued to enhance our InfoSec Program by refreshing our internal policies for the combined company, all of which are available for users on IFF’s intranet. InfoSec policies establish governance based on controls, standards, and compliance requirements for applicable regulations. We updated the comprehensive internal Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) first as it is applicable to the entire organization and every employee is expected and required to read, acknowledge, understand and be in compliance with it. The AUP ensures the appropriate and responsible use of IFF computer systems and applications and includes rules for general use and ownership, electronic communication, internet usage, data security, privacy and incident reporting. Our internal Data Classification Policy outlines how IFF data should be properly classified and handled according to defined data classification levels. InfoSec is a shared responsibility, and to best protect our network, computers and data from threats, we rely on our employees to be our first line of defense. Our risk-aligned strategy begins with employee awareness through regular communication, including monthly newsletters, bulletins, events, phishing campaigns and companywide emails on best practices. We were also excited to announce the launch of our formal InfoSec Awareness & Training Program in 2021, designed to help employees recognize potential InfoSec threats and provide helpful guidance to incorporate into their everyday tasks. In alignment with an accompanying internal InfoSec Awareness & Training Policy, all users with IFF systems accounts were required to complete mandatory web-based training on topics including InfoSec essentials, phishing threats and email security on mobile devices. Moving forward, we will review InfoSec Awareness training annually and update as needed to continually strengthen user knowledge on information security-related issues. IFF is committed to protecting the privacy of the personal data of our employees, customers, and any other parties with whom we have a business relationship and from whom we collect personal data. IFF’s Global Privacy Compliance Program, overseen by our Chief Privacy Officer, ensures compliance with applicable privacy and data protection laws in the countries in which we do business. This Program includes privacy notices to individuals whose data is processed by IFF, employee privacy policies and training, processes in compliance with regulatory compliance, and data protection agreements with third parties who process personal data on IFF’s behalf. We also keep abreast of and review pending global privacy laws on an ongoing basis. We have multiple InfoSec tools in place to deter threat actors, block malicious/phishing emails, and avoid IT system interruptions. This includes implementation of measures designed to protect the personal data in our possession 129 Appendix Equity & Wellbeing Responsible Sourcing Transparency & Accountability Climate & Planetary Health Sustainable Solutions Our ESG+ Commitment Introduction\n",
      "of employees, customers, and third parties with whom we do business from unauthorized access and disclosure, such as firewalls, secure remote access tools, unique and complex passwords, encryption, endpoint security, and email security. Similarly, as part of our own risk-based due diligence, we expect the third-parties we engage with to protect IFF’s and our customers’ confidential information. As outlined in our Vendor Code of Conduct, vendors that access, store, host, or process confidential information are asked to complete our standard risk assessment and may be subject to an audit. We regularly conduct third- party vendor risk assessment questionnaires to identify and decrease potential IFF business uncertainties related to hiring vendors for IT products and services. In accordance with our internal InfoSec Compliance & Audit Policy that was formalized for the combined company in 2021, InfoSec, ERM, and Internal Audit teams periodically conduct risk assessments to evaluate and assess the severity and likelihood of potential incidents, as well as audit IFF systems for compliance with applicable policies and controls. We participate in external audits of our control procedures, policies, and compliance mechanisms to ensure their effectiveness and confirm adherence. The InfoSec team reviews all audit results and findings with auditors, tracks findings to ensure prompt resolutions or mitigating controls, and regularly reports remediation status to management until each finding is closed. We also annually recertify compliance with Sarbanes-Oxley (SOX), the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission act to improve the accuracy of corporate disclosures and to protect shareholders and the general public from accounting errors and fraudulent practices in enterprises. All IFF users must report any discovered or suspected information security incidents or policy breaches immediately to InfoSec@ iff.com. Users may also report concerns or violations at http://iff.com/speakup to initiate InfoSec to perform an investigation of alleged misconduct in accordance with internal procedures. In the event of an incident or breach, we follow our comprehensive InfoSec Incident Response Plan, which provides guidance for detecting, containing, eradicating, and recovering from potential incidents. In 2021, we did not experience any material information security incidents or breaches of personal data. As outlined in our internal InfoSec Incident Management Policy, formalized in 2021 for the combined company, we review and update the InfoSec Incident Response Plan annually to incorporate lessons learned and to affirm the Plan’s continued overall effectiveness. As part of this approach, we regularly evaluate the effectiveness of our systems and test our contingency plans by conducting vulnerability analyses and information security tabletop exercises. In the event of an unplanned incident that may take critical IFF systems offline, the Company’s business continuity and disaster recovery procedures outline how we will continue to operate during a disruption in service. Our internal InfoSec Resiliency Policy, also formalized in 2021 for the combined company, reinforces this approach by helping to ensure that IFF’s critical business processes and support systems will continue to function within an acceptable timeframe following an unplanned business process failure. 130 Appendix Equity & Wellbeing Responsible Sourcing Transparency & Accountability Climate & Planetary Health Sustainable Solutions Our ESG+ Commitment Introduction\n",
      "PRODUCT RESPONSIBILITY As a global business, IFF serves many industries with our broad range of products. Our Global Regulatory Affairs (GRA) function monitors, analyzes, and engages in legislative and regulatory developments that impact IFF. GRA works with business teams to help them understand and comply with government regulations, self-regulatory frameworks, and internal corporate policies. In 2021, IFF established a government and public affairs team (Public Affairs) within GRA to advance IFF’s business and reputational priorities with public policy audiences. Public Affairs’ policy advocacy work supports responsible innovation, as well as sustainable operations, products, and technologies at IFF. The team collaborates internally and externally to address existing, emerging, and known risks (e.g., product safety, quality, efficacy, and environmental impact) and engages with stakeholders around IFF’s approach to responsible innovation and safety. The team also aligns external stakeholder engagement to inform IFF’s advocacy, sustainability, and ESG objectives and practices. In the regulatory science space, IFF shares technical information through publications and industry organizations with government authorities to inform policy-making and promote the use of scientific, risk-based approaches to ingredients evaluation. For example, the use of modern biotechnology is an enabling tool to develop sustainable solutions for our customers, such as enzymes that replace chemicals, provide energy savings, and facilitate better use of natural resources. On the one hand, this represents a tremendous opportunity for IFF and the biobased industry at large, while at the same time harboring some risk in terms of consumer acceptance and potentially restrictive rulemaking in response to consumer sentiment. We therefore engage with regulators and other stakeholders to provide them relevant information on why and how we use biotechnology, and to share best practices on safe product design and risk assessment. It is of note that IFF’s products do not contain live genetically modified organisms (GMOs) even though we use genetically engineered microbes (GEMs) to produce enzymes and other ingredients. In addition, IFF may source raw materials from genetically modified commodities for markets and applications where this is accepted, yet our refined products (such as soy protein and lecithin) do not contain live GMOs. As customer requirements vary, IFF’s Ingredients business delivers protein solutions in both GM and Identity Preserved non-GM categories. IFF supports the need for transparency in the supply chain and with consumers on this topic as it relates to the origin of ingredients in food. For example, we provide technical information to our customers that informs their decision-making regarding their ability to seek third-party GMO certification. In 2021, IFF also worked with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and the U.S. Department of Agriculture to clarify whether food manufacturers’ use of enzymes would impact food manufacturers’ disclosure obligations under the National Bioengineering Disclosure Standard. Globally, IFF also monitors developments in registration and compliance requirements to inform our R&D innovation processes. During 2021, the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA) continued to hold stakeholder consultations on microplastics and continued the work to develop proposals on potential regulatory restrictions and disclosure requirements. IFF’s engagement in this process informed an R&D innovation initiative to develop sustainable fragrance encapsulations to address the biodegradability and solubility of polymers. 131 Appendix Equity & Wellbeing Responsible Sourcing Transparency & Accountability Climate & Planetary Health Sustainable Solutions Our ESG+ Commitment Introduction\n",
      "Quality & Product Safety Our responsibility and commitment to Quality, Food, and Product Safety defines who we are as IFFers. We see every day as an opportunity to make a difference in the lives of our employees, customers, consumers, and communities that we serve through safe practices, responsible manufacturing, and quality products. Our Global Quality & Product Safety teams manage quality programs to ensure product safety and compliance with all applicable laws, regulations, and customer requirements. We maintain a comprehensive database of all raw materials that are used as inputs for IFF’s products, which documents, among other things, information about regulatory status, countries of sale, and end- use applications. In 2021, as part of our integration following the merger with N&B, we reorganized our corporate Quality organization in ways that best support IFF’s end-to-end value chain. We saw new opportunities to strengthen our Quality program and undertook exercises in benchmarking against quality best practices and technologies, trend analyses, reviews of audit results and lessons learned, including analyzing internal leading and lagging indicators of performance, and listening to the voice of both customers and employees. At the same time, our harmonization efforts also represented some of our biggest challenges during the year, including redefining roles, responsibilities, and lines of accountability; extracting data from multiple enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems; and communicating and driving one consistent Quality culture expectation across the organization. To set the tone for our program moving forward, we launched a new Global Quality Policy, signed by the CEO to further emphasize the expectations of our leadership. We also joined with other Operations teams to create a set of Integrated Operations Core Principles and an accompanying employee engagement campaign to emphasize the four ways we “Find a Better Way for Our Customers” in the areas of safety, quality, sustainability, and integrity. For example, one or more aspects of the Principles are integrated in some way into Operations meetings, facilitating frequent discussions and, in turn, helping to change the overall organizational culture.

      "Our promise is to never compromise on the safety or quality of any product, as it is our responsibility to protect our employees, customers, consumers, communities, and shareholders. We strive to demonstrate our commitment for excellence to these stakeholders by: •\t Being our customers’ partner of choice by providing sustainable products and services that are trusted and preferred, and which comply with all applicable regulatory and statutory requirements. All finished IFF products undergo final quality control testing, which, depending on the product, includes sensory, analytical, and microbiological analysis. In cooperation with regulators and our trade associations, we manage a set of policies and procedures to help IFF achieve safety compliance in all countries where we operate. Our regulatory disclosure approach provides our basic framework for responding to product information requests from regulatory agencies while managing confidential business information. Listening to the voice of our customers, we proactively lead compliance monitoring programs and operate three Product Integrity Analysis (PIA) Labs globally that have the expertise and capacity to test raw materials at low limits to identify potential contamination or meet new specifications, such as regulation on fragrance allergens. In 2021, our PIA Lab in Tilburg, the Netherlands, achieved ISO 17025 certification, further solidifying customer confidence in our work. We also partner with our customers on challenges related to product marketing and service labeling. In the event of any related incident, we coordinate directly with our customers and regulatory authorities as needed to resolve the issue. All such incidents result in root cause analysis and corrective action where appropriate. In case of potential health concerns for customers, we also have a procedure in place to voluntarily recall products. •\t Effectively outlining Quality, Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP), and Food & Product Safety programs to safeguard our employees, products, and facilities. We conduct a variety of inspections at our operating facilities, including supplier audits and quality audits. Our manufacturing facilities are certified to the standards that are applicable for their specific product types, e.g., the Global Food Safety Initiative (GFSI) for cosmetic, dietary, nutrition, and animal feed products. In alignment with the FDA’s Food Safety Modernization Act (FSMA), we also have an independent third party conduct FSMA audits on our Nourish manufacturing facilities. •\t Challenging the status quo to continuously improve. Through tools, knowledge, and experience, we create a workforce environment that embraces continuous improvement. At the end of 2021, for example, we developed and launched a global training and onboarding program (available in 26 languages) for all current Operations employees in the combined company (approximately 15,000), and for new Operations employees (to complete as part of their onboarding process) to ensure understanding of one consistent safety, quality, sustainability, and integrity message. We are continuously tracking completion rates to reach our target of 100% participation acknowledgment. By streamlining processes and finding new efficiencies, we also add value to our business, increase our customers’ satisfaction, and further promote a quality culture. For example, in 2021, we expanded our Culture of Quality program to new locations (including legacy Frutarom sites) to reduce high-risk customer complaints and reduce overall risk to the enterprise. Originally created within IFF in 2018, the Culture of Quality program seeks to drive 133 Appendix Equity & Wellbeing Responsible Sourcing Transparency & Accountability Climate & Planetary Health Sustainable Solutions Our ESG+ Commitment Introduction\n",

Through our risk management process, vendor development programs, technologically advanced analytical capabilities, and sensorial skills, we carefully select the sources of our products and services. We use effective manufacturing quality control techniques to monitor and verify our vendors’ ability to deliver products that meet our global material specifications and service requirements. In 2021, we enhanced our vendor management program to consolidate two sets of vendors from both heritage organizations. As part of our due diligence and risk management processes, vendors are assessed by our internal Material Review Committee and audited (which may include testing raw material samples) to ensure all products meet our specifications from both a regulatory and quality perspective.

      "Issues related to human rights are managed by our business units and Human Resources teams, and any potential human rights violations are investigated by the Law department. We release an annual Slavery and Human Trafficking Statement that provides information on our global human rights due diligence processes. We conduct human rights due diligence by implementing a review and screening of our global direct spend suppliers, which helps IFF prioritize our auditing and verification efforts. Based on our human rights due diligence screening (see Risk Assessment & Prioritization, page 70), we may require participation in EcoVadis and Sedex. These platforms help drive continuous improvement in the areas of labor standards, health and safety, environmental management, and ethical business conduct. We focus our efforts with Sedex on a core set of suppliers that are critical to our business, reviewing the list annually as our supply chain evolves. The Sedex Risk Assessment Tool allows us to prioritize our suppliers for completion of the Sedex Self- Assessment Questionnaire and Sedex Members Ethical Trade Audit (SMETA) 4-pillar audits, which include human rights considerations. In addition to our assessment of our suppliers, 85% of our major manufacturing facilities29 have undergone SMETA audits. Based on the due diligence processes and risk assessment processes described above, we have not identified significant risk in our direct operations for forced or compulsory labor, child labor or violations of the right to freely associate and bargain collectively. However, we still take active steps to protect against any potential human rights issues that could arise in naturals supply chains where we proactively lead responsible sourcing programs (for example, see pages 72 and 84).

Risks are categorized as transition risks or physical risks. Transition risks result from a global transition to a low-carbon and climate-resilient economy, and physical risks result from extreme weather events and sustained higher temperatures. Although climate-related risks and opportunities exist, none were identified to have a substantive financial or strategic impact on our business. IFF defines ‘substantive financial impact’ when identifying or assessing climate-related risks and opportunities in both our direct operations and supply chain as any change that would significantly affect our business and operations. We continue to monitor potential risks and opportunities on an ongoing basis and will update our conclusions as appropriate based on this process.

Impact on businesses, strategy, and financial planning (continued) Through IFF’s enterprise risk management (ERM) effort, we aim to pro-actively manage company-wide business risks. Impact on Business and Strategy IFF’s strategies for operations are influenced by climate-related risks and opportunities, particularly through the assessment of the Company’s newly acquired assets. IFF’s strategies for the Company’s products and services and supply chain are influenced by climate-related risks and opportunities, particularly through the investment in new sustainable products. IFF’s sustainable innovation is facilitated through our internal evaluation of all R&D projects based on sustainability criteria that address all life cycle stages and a wide range of environmental and social impacts. In manufacturing, we champion circular design through biotechnology and green chemistry. This includes ensuring energy and resource efficiency, expanding our use of renewable energy, and focusing on zero waste, where possible. Impact on Financial Planning Climate-related risks and opportunities are considered throughout IFF’s financial planning. For example, climate change effects can have a negative impact on crop size and quality, impacting the availability and pricing of raw materials. These risks can negatively impact cost expectations, as our profits and operating results could be adversely affected. Do More Good Plan In 2021, informed by our materiality assessment, IFF announced the Do More Good Plan, our Environmental, Social, and Governance, plus Sustainable Solutions (or ESG+) roadmap that activates our purpose of applying science and creativity for a better world. Supported by a set of ambitious 2030 targets that aim to influence industry-wide change, our strategy is comprised of four pillars where we can have the greatest impact. Our commitment to Climate & Planetary Health is driven by the urgent need to protect the planet for future generations. To underscore our commitment to supporting the health of the planet and leading on science-based climate action, we have identified the following high-level environmental goals: •\t Reduce absolute direct and indirect (Scope 1 and 2 under our operational control) GHG emissions by 50% below 2021 levels by 2030 •\t Achieve net zero (Scope 1 and 2) GHG emissions by 2040; and be net positive across our entire value chain (cradle-to-gate) by 2050. •\t Verify zero waste to landfill for all major manufacturing facilities while minimizing single-use plastics and championing water stewardship by 2030. 190 Our ESG+ Commitment Introduction\n",

IFF’s ERM program continuously assesses direct operations and downstream and upstream climate change and other sustainability risks. Our ERM program is designed to identify and assess our global risks and to develop steps to mitigate and manage risks. As part of our risk management practices, IFF has established a management risk committee chaired by the CFO and General Counsel and made up of key members of the Company’s management to integrate global risk activities and to ensure appropriate prioritization of resources and alignment across the Company. Assessment of Climate-related Risks Climate risks and opportunities are assessed based on the magnitude and likelihood of impact, potential financial impact, return on investment, scale of capital costs or operational expenditures and potential for disruption or delays in production. 192 Our ESG+ Commitment Introduction\n",

Integration into overall risk management Climate & Planetary Health, page 49 Metrics & Targets, page 54 Risk Management, page 127 2022 Proxy Statement, page 30 CDP Climate Change response (Question C2.2, pages 10-15) Integration with Enterprise Risk Management: through a robust risk oversight structure characterized by a division of responsibility, we believe we have established the most effective approach for addressing risk management at IFF that allows for open communication between the Board, its committees, and management. IFF’s identification of climate-related risks is formally integrated into the Company’s multi-disciplinary ERM program, designed to identify and assess global risks to our business. The Board receives regular reports on the ERM process and the Company’s risk mitigation activities, including sustainability risks. 193 Our ESG+ Commitment Introduction\n",

      "ABOUT FREEPORT-MCMORAN Freeport-McMoRan Inc. (Freeport-McMoRan, Freeport or FCX) is a leading international mining company with headquarters in Phoenix, Arizona. FCX operates large, long-lived, geographically diverse assets with significant proven and probable reserves of copper, gold and molybdenum. FCX is one of the world’s largest publicly traded copper producers. FCX’s portfolio of assets includes the Grasberg minerals district in Indonesia (PT Freeport Indonesia or PT-FI), one of the world’s largest copper and gold deposits, and significant mining operations in North America and South America (Freeport Minerals Corporation or FMC), including the large-scale Morenci minerals district in Arizona and the Cerro Verde operation in Peru. For purposes of this report only, references to (1) FMC Mining includes all mining operations in North America and South America (the Americas), (2) Downstream Processing (Downstream Processing) includes all operations downstream of mining in the Americas and Europe, (3) Freeport Americas Copper includes all copper mining operations in the Americas plus the Miami Smelter and El Paso Refinery and (4) PT Freeport Indonesia or PT-FI includes our operations in Papua, Indonesia.

      "LETTER TO STAKEHOLDERS Dear Stakeholders, Freeport is a leading producer of the metals essential to support the global energy transition. Our principal product – copper – is critical to the technologies necessary to enable decarbonization. As I reflect on recent events of this year alone, there is no doubt that a changing climate is negatively impacting our environment and society. In 2021, Freeport had two wildfires near our operations in Arizona, our Sierrita operation received record rainfall, the United States government declared for the first time a water shortage on the Colorado River and the Andes Mountains in Chile and Peru are experiencing record drought conditions. As both a major consumer of energy, and a producer of the copper essential to the energy transition, we know we have a responsibility to take action. We have inspiring work underway across our global business to reduce our own greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, improve energy efficiency across our operations, advance the use of renewable energy, and better understand and enhance our own resilience to future climate-related risks. In 2020, we published our inaugural climate report, established our first GHG emissions reduction target for the Americas copper business, and committed to aligning our future climate-related disclosures with the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate- related Financial Disclosures (TCFD). In 2021, we completed our first global climate scenario analysis, established a cross-functional climate team, significantly enhanced climate expertise on our Board, directly linked climate performance with our executive compensation program and advanced our analysis of renewable energy opportunities in the southwestern United States. With the publication of this report, I am also pleased to announce that we established a new 30% GHG emissions reduction target for our Indonesian operations by 2030 (versus a 2018 baseline). Today, PT-FI represents roughly 50% of our global Scope 1 emissions. This target furthers our resolve to reduce our GHG emissions. We plan to submit our GHG emissions reduction targets to the Science Based Target initiative (SBTi), a collaboration between CDP, World Resources Institute, World Wildlife Fund and the United Nations Global Compact, mobilizing companies to set science-based targets. Validating our GHG emissions reduction targets against the SBTi criteria is critical to understanding if our 2030 targets sufficiently align with the Paris Agreement’s goals. This process also will provide us with an independent third-party review of our plans, which is important to our decision-making as we refine and make additional commitments that advance our climate strategy. Freeport aspires to participate in – and positively contribute to – a 2050 net zero economy. Not only is it the right thing to do for society and for the environment, it is also good business. However, not all net zero targets are created equal. The definition of net zero and the path to get there varies and is often inconsistent. We have challenged ourselves to develop a more robust understanding of how we can move beyond our aspirational vision to a science-based net zero pathway. Today, we believe we have a clear view of the primary challenges to achieve net zero GHG emissions across our various operating regions. For example, there is not yet a commercially viable alternative to the diesel-fueled haul trucks critical to our global open-pit mining operations. In Indonesia, we are challenged to shift away from coal for reliable electricity production in the short-to-medium term given, among other things, the remote nature of our operations. Richard C. Adkerson Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer September 2021\n",
      "Looking ahead, we acknowledge that future climate-related challenges for Freeport will require a meaningful shift in powering our operations and related equipment and potentially significant financial commitments. We also know that our path to net zero carbon emissions will require new technological solutions and innovation that must be driven by collaborative and meaningful industry commitment. Freeport embraces these challenges and we are dedicated to exploring and contributing to viable solutions including through our work with the International Council on Mining and Metals (ICMM) and the International Copper Association. We are actively engaged with the ICMM's Innovation for Cleaner, Safer Vehicles initiative focused on developing low-GHG emissions mining equipment as well as with our own equipment manufacturers. We are also now a patron supporter of the Charge on Innovation Challenge, a global industry initiative aimed at developing concepts for large-scale haul truck electrification systems. In Papua, at our PT-FI operations, we are also evaluating alternative fuel options including the feasibility of liquefied natural gas (LNG). We believe Freeport is uniquely positioned to eventually meet stakeholder expectations for both our contribution to – and our own alignment with – a 1.5°C scenario. This is in part because Scope 3 emissions related to converting copper cathode into usable products like wire are minimal compared to other materials. It is also because copper plays a crucial role in electrification, renewables, and energy efficient technologies. In the coming years we plan to progress our climate strategy, including reporting on our progress, opportunities, challenges and aspirations. We will continue to integrate our climate initiatives into our long-term business plans as we work to supply the global economy with the copper necessary to support the global energy transition for the benefit of all stakeholders.

      "Production from our Lone Star mine in Arizona, where we completed development in 2020, is expected to exceed 200 million pounds of copper in 2021. We are dedicated to positively contributing to society by supplying the world with copper — Responsibly. Reliably. Relentlessly.\n",
      "2020 CLIMATE REPORT / 2 Our Approach Freeport recognizes that climate change poses considerable near- and long-term challenges for society and for our own operational and financial performance. Mining is energy-intensive and generates significant GHG emissions that contribute to climate change. However, the copper we produce will play an essential role in global decarbonization given it is a critical component in the technologies that will be deployed in a highly electrified and low-carbon economy, including solar and wind energy, electric vehicles and other energy efficient technologies. As one of the world’s largest copper producers, Freeport understands its critical role in supplying the materials needed to enable the low-carbon energy transition. We remain dedicated to supplying the global economy with responsibly produced copper which includes operating in a manner that manages and mitigates our own GHG emissions as well as other climate- related risks and impacts. This report seeks to provide our stakeholders with an update on our progress towards TCFD alignment as well as an update on our continued progress to advance our climate strategy throughout our global business, across our three strategy pillars. THREE STRATEGY PILLARS › Reduction: We strive to reduce, manage and mitigate our GHG emissions, where possible. In 2020, we established our initial public target to reduce our GHG emissions intensity in the Americas by 15% per metric ton of copper cathode by 2030 from our 2018 baseline. With this report, we have established an additional target to reduce our GHG emissions in Indonesia by 30% per metric ton of payable copper by 2030 from our 2018 baseline. To learn more, refer to the Performance section of this report. › Resilience: We strive to enhance our resilience to both the physical and transitional risks associated with climate change for our current and future operations, our host communities and our stakeholders. This includes working to analyze and prepare for extreme weather events, water stress and other potential climate change impacts while also supporting our host communities and responding to anticipated market and regulatory demands. To learn more about our progress, refer to the Resilience section of this report. › Contribution: We strive to be a positive contributor beyond our operational boundaries by responsibly producing the copper and molybdenum necessary for the technologies needed to enable a future energy transition. This includes collaborating with partners in our value chain to support the global economy’s transition to a low-carbon economy. To learn more, refer to Contribution section of this report.\n",
      "Governance Sustainability is embedded in Freeport’s values and business strategy. Governance and oversight of sustainability ultimately resides with the Board, with day-to-day oversight by the executive leadership and site- level management teams. Good governance requires strong leadership to ensure the values of the company are integrated into everyday operations and business decisions. It also means having the structure and processes in place to facilitate effective decision-making and actions that advance the long-term interests of all our stakeholders. Given the breadth and complexity of sustainability issues, our governance structure seeks to leverage our internal climate, regulatory and technical expertise to create an interdisciplinary team responsible for identification of risks and opportunities and effective management and oversight. BOARD OF DIRECTORS The Board oversees and guides the company’s business strategy and monitors the development and management of risks that impact the company’s strategic goals. In its risk oversight role, the Board reviews, evaluates and discusses with members of management whether the risk management processes designed and implemented by management are adequate in identifying, assessing, managing and mitigating material risks facing the company, including financial, international, operational, social and environmental risks. The Board as a whole is responsible for risk oversight at the company, with reviews of certain areas being conducted by one of its four standing committees: Audit, Compensation, Corporate Responsibility and Governance, each of which is composed entirely of independent directors and regularly reports to the full Board. Committee charters define the roles and responsibilities of each committee within the company’s governance framework. Our Corporate Governance Guidelines along with the charters of our principal Board committees provide the framework for the governance of our company and reflect the Board’s commitment to monitor the effectiveness of policy and decision-making at both the Board and management levels. THE BOARD’S CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY COMMITTEE The Corporate Responsibility Committee (CRC) is responsible for providing advice, recommendations and oversight to the company’s management team on environmental and social matters. The CRC regularly reviews the effectiveness of management’s strategies, programs and policy implementation with respect to safety and health, responsible production frameworks, tailings management and stewardship, climate change, water stewardship, biodiversity, waste management, human capital management (including inclusion and diversity initiatives), human rights, stakeholder relations, social performance and Indigenous Peoples, responsible sourcing, and political activity and spending practices. During 2020, the CRC met three times, and a member of the CRC participated directly in several shareholder engagement calls during the year to solicit feedback on our sustainability programs and practices. Climate-related matters were discussed in two of the three regularly scheduled CRC meetings in 2020, and to date in 2021, management has presented an update on our climate strategy and global scenario analysis in both meetings.

      "2020 CLIMATE REPORT / 4 In 2021, the Board progressed its refreshment process, welcoming four new directors – David Abney, Bob Dudley, Marcela Donadio and Sara Grootwassink Lewis. Both Mr. Abney and Mr. Dudley have expertise in sustainability matters, including climate risk-management, strategy and disclosure. Mr. Abney is the retired Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of United Parcel Service, a multinational package delivery and supply chain management company, where he was responsible for progressing its climate strategy and TCFD-aligned disclosures. Mr. Dudley is the retired Group Chief Executive of BP, a British multinational oil and gas company, and since 2016, he has chaired the Oil and Gas Climate Initiative, a CEO- led initiative that aims to accelerate the oil and gas industry’s response to climate change. Mr. Dudley was appointed to the CRC in May 2021. EXECUTIVE & SUSTAINABILITY LEADERSHIP Our Chairman and CEO has ultimate responsibility for the company’s sustainability performance. The company’s cross-functional Sustainability Leadership Team (SLT) includes members of the management team tasked with defining the sustainability strategy – including the climate strategy – and implementing our sustainability policies, systems and programs across the organization. In 2020, the SLT met four times, and in 2021, the SLT has met monthly and regularly reports to executive leadership, including our Chairman and CEO, and President and Chief Financial Officer. In addition, members of the SLT report to the CRC on key environmental, social and governance (ESG) matters, including climate, at regularly scheduled meetings. The SLT is sponsored by our Senior Vice President and Chief Administrative Officer and is led by our Vice President and Chief Sustainability Officer, with active participation from other members of the SLT, including our four business unit Presidents. SLT membership also includes Vice Presidents or senior representatives from functional groups including health and safety, security, supply chain, human resources, sales, legal, compliance, sustainability and finance. To date in 2021, the SLT has regularly reviewed, discussed and addressed climate-related matters in its meetings. CLIMATE TEAM In 2020, we established a cross-functional climate team to focus on climate- related risks and opportunities, coordinate and implement our climate strategy, and support the business to prepare the company for the transition to a low-carbon future. The climate team is made up of representatives from across the business, including operations, sustainability, legal, engineering, government relations and finance, and is led by senior representatives from operations and sustainability, enabling us to integrate and operationalize our climate- related activities in an efficient manner. Periodically, members of the climate team report to the SLT on our climate strategy implementation progress. In early 2021, we enhanced our climate team with two new key positions, a senior climate engineer who is involved with advancing our climate strategy and a general manager of sustainable mining who is responsible for driving the link between mine efficiency efforts and sustainability with a focus on mine operations, equipment lifecycle management, mine technology opportunities and carbon emissions reduction. We believe these new leadership roles will be instrumental in advancing our long-term decarbonization and climate strategy efforts. CLIMATE & EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION Executive officers are held accountable for the company’s sustainability performance through the company’s performance-based annual incentive program (AIP). In 2020, ESG metrics collectively accounted for 25% of the AIP (15% safety and 10% sustainability). Starting in 2021, climate change performance was integrated into executive compensation, contributing to the sustainability component of the AIP. 25 % E S G ANNUAL INCENTIVE PROGRAM 35% Operational 40% Financial 10% Sustainability 15% Safety\n",
      "Risk Management Freeport has several processes in place to identify and assess climate-related risks, including our global climate scenario analyses (the first of which was completed earlier this year), our sustainability risk register process and Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) program. We are currently in the process of further integrating significant potential climate impacts (including both transition and physical risks) into both our sustainability risk register and ERM program, following the results of our global climate scenario analysis. To learn more about our global climate scenario analysis, refer to the Resilience section of this report. RISK REGISTER Freeport's sustainability risk register process is used to identify, prioritize and track sustainability risks and actions at the corporate- and site-level. Defined in a global standard operating procedure, the process uses a 4 x 4 assessment matrix to classify risks by both their likelihood and consequence based on customized impact definitions by functional area to drive appropriate action. All risks require annual monitoring, and detailed actions plans are required for those rated as critical. The risks included in the sustainability risk register are mapped to our external commitments, including all 38 International Council on Mining and Metals (ICMM) Performance Expectations, and the Copper Mark’s 32 ESG requirements. Our sustainability risk register is the focal point of our internal and external assurance process required to validate our commitments. Specific to climate, ICMM member companies are required to implement processes for governance, engagement and disclosure, advance site-level adaptation and mitigation solutions, engage with host communities and others in the value chain, monitor and disclose Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions, and engage with external parties to determine a preferred approach to reporting Scope 3 GHG emissions. The Copper Mark requires participants to develop and implement energy efficiency programs, increase the use of renewable energy, set GHG emissions targets, and report externally on both energy and GHG emissions performance at a site level according to an internationally recognized protocol. Our sustainability risk register supports our teams to identify and prioritize the most significant risks, and ultimately the most meaningful actions, to our business and to our stakeholders across various sustainability areas beyond climate – such as health and safety, human rights, environmental management, community development and engagement, and economic impact. We work collaboratively to implement our various commitments, and our sustainability risk register process allows site-level management teams to tailor their site-specific priorities while helping to support globally consistent implementation. Risks such as acute or chronic physical risks, current or emerging regulations, reputation, value chain, or others identified through our climate scenario analysis or by our operations teams are being integrated into site registers, and associated action plans are being developed and implemented. For example, our operational risks are updated annually and now include site-specific, climate-related risks for both physical risks, such as water stress and extreme events, and transition risks, such as the cost of energy and carbon taxes. ENTERPRISE RISK MANAGEMENT Our ERM program seeks to identify and track risks and opportunities that could impact Freeport’s business-wide strategic objectives. Freeport’s ERM committee, comprised of senior executives with responsibility across operations and core business functions, is responsible for providing input and oversight to the ERM framework. The program focuses on current and emerging issues, both within and outside our operational boundaries, which could jeopardize or enhance our strategic position. Our ERM program seeks to link our global operations and supporting business functions in order to (1) identify enterprise risks and opportunities, (2) analyze and prioritize risks (including vulnerability, impact and root causes), (3) review risk control environments and determine additional management actions, and (4) monitor and periodically report progress.\n",
      "2020 CLIMATE REPORT / 6 INTERNAL COST OF CARBON Freeport operates in some countries and regions with existing carbon pricing policies in place including Chile, the United Kingdom and Europe. The government of Indonesia is also considering carbon pricing initiatives. Depending on the future state of various climate policies and the speed at which the world adopts various policies and initiatives, we recognize that all of our operating regions must prepare for carbon pricing regimes. With the benefit of our global scenario analysis (discussed in more detail in the Resilience section), as well as input and ongoing dialogue with external stakeholders and associations, Freeport has established an internal carbon shadow price range between $50-$150 per metric ton of CO2 equivalent. We believe that this price range will provide a key input to our decision-making for both current operations as well as future projects. We are working to integrate this into our business processes to evaluate the potential impacts of an imposed carbon pricing regime on our current operations, longer-term business plans and potential future projects. As a first step, we have begun to integrate the carbon shadow price range into our internal life-of-mine plans. As a next step, we plan to integrate the price range into the evaluations and approval process for projects. We recognize that climate-related policy changes are dynamic and rapidly shifting, and that our pricing assumptions must also be iterative and flexible. Accordingly, we are committed to reviewing our pricing scale periodically so that the range is appropriate and relevant as part of our decision-making factors. Freeport has established an internal carbon price range of $50-$150 per metric ton of CO2 equivalent. Members of the PT-FI environmental team conduct estuary monitoring and sample the water of the Arafura Sea.\n",

      "2020 CLIMATE REPORT / 8 Performance Our global annual absolute GHG emissions (Scope 1 and Scope 2) range between 7 to 9 million metric tons per year. Of this, approximately 70% comes from our FMC Mining operations in the Americas and Downstream Processing in the Americas and Europe, and 30% comes from our PT-FI operations in Indonesia. Over half of our FMC Mining and Downstream Processing GHG emissions are from purchased electricity (Scope 2); whereas, PT-FI’s GHG emissions result from coal (70%) used to generate reliable electricity for our remote operations in the eastern province of Papua and the remaining from diesel (30%) used to generate power and for mobile equipment. GHG emissions at our Indonesia operations are all Scope 1. In 2020, our global absolute Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions decreased by 8% from approximately 7.8 million metric tons the prior year to 7.1 million metric tons, and the reduction was driven predominantly by reduced production and stripping at our Americas operations as a result of operational changes associated with our COVID-19 response, uncertain economic conditions, and PT-FI’s operational transition from open-pit to underground mining during the year. Our absolute Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG emissions in 2020 were 21% lower than 2016 levels, due to significant improvements in energy efficiency and grid decarbonization, as well as periods of reduced mining rates at PT-FI. 10,000,000 8,000,000 6,000,000 4,000,000 2,000,000 0 Scope 2 Scope 1 GLOBAL ABSOLUTE GHG EMISSIONS 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 CO2e METRIC TONS\n",
      "We calculate our GHG emissions inventory using the WRI/WBCSD Greenhouse Gas Protocol (GHG Protocol), which utilizes using an internal database to gather data from our sites. Each year, a third party verifies our GHG emissions inventory against the ISO 14064 GHG emissions standard and provides an assurance statement which can be found at the end of this report. A summary of our five-year global GHG emissions data can be found on the following page. For site-level GHG emissions, energy use and power source data, please refer to the Performance Data section. Our current Scope 3 emissions estimates represent a smaller proportion than our Scope 1 and 2 emissions given the minimal downstream processing required to transform copper concentrate into cathode and cathode into various forms, such as wire for electrical cables. In 2020 and the first half of 2021, we enhanced and expanded our Scope 3 emissions calculations to include additional categories in line with the GHG Protocol. Our 2020 Scope 3 emissions are estimated to be 19% of Scope 1, 2 and 3 combined emissions.

      "Climate Reduction Targets Freeport recognizes the near- and long-term challenges of climate change for society and for our own operations. We strive to manage, mitigate and reduce our GHG emissions where possible. To date, we have developed two GHG emissions (Scope 1 and 2) reduction targets for our business in order to help manage relevant, climate-related risks and support the decarbonization of our business – the first, established in 2020, seeks to reduce the GHG emissions intensity of Freeport Americas Copper operations by 15% from our 2018 baseline. The second, established this year, seeks to reduce the GHG emissions intensity of our Indonesia operations by 30% by 2030, from our 2018 baseline. We plan to submit our GHG emissions reduction targets to the SBTi, a widely accepted standard for GHG emissions reduction goals, for validation. Validating our GHG emissions reduction targets against the SBTi criteria is critical to understanding if our targets adequately support the Paris Agreement’s goal of limiting global warming well below 2°C. The SBTi validation process also will provide us with an independent third-party review of our plans, which will play a part in our own decision-making as we seek to take action – and to make commitments – that advance our climate strategy. We plan to initiate the SBTi validation process in the near term. We acknowledge that future adjustments to our existing targets may be required as a result of the SBTi validation process, and we plan to provide an update on our progress in future reporting. 2030 GHG EMISSIONS INTENSITY REDUCTION TARGETS REGION / BUSINESS UNIT INTENSITY REDUCTION1 2018 BASELINE YEAR 2030 TARGET YEAR Freeport Americas Copper2 15% reduction per metric ton of copper cathode 3.72 3.17     PT-FI (Grasberg)3 30% reduction per metric ton of payable copper 4.76 3.34 1 Intensity reduction targets (CO2e metric tons / metric ton cu) include total (Scope 1 and Scope 2) GHG emissions and do not include by-products in the denominator.

      "2020 CLIMATE REPORT / 14 PT-FI TARGET CONTEXT PT-FI’s operations are located in the Grasberg mineral district, one of the world’s largest copper and gold deposits, in the province of Papua, Indonesia. The operating area is accessible from our Amamapare port facility at the Arafura Sea and the city of Timika’s local airport. PT-FI’s underground ore bodies range in elevation between 2,590 and 3,110 meters above sea level and include a 70-mile service road from the port facility in the Lowlands to the mill complex in the Highlands. The high elevation and remote location create a challenging environment for delivery of reliable power. Currently, PT-FI’s electrical power is primarily supplied by our coal-fired power plant, with an installed capacity of 198MW, which was built in 1998. Diesel generators, with an installed capacity of 130MW, provide peak and backup capacity. Due to the high carbon intensity of coal-fired electricity, in 2020, PT-FI’s operations generated approximately 30% of our global absolute GHG emissions and approximately 50% of our global Scope 1 emissions. In 2020, the ramp-up of underground production at the Grasberg Block Cave (GBC) and Deep Mill Level Zone (DMLZ) underground mines advanced, following completion of mining the Grasberg open-pit in 2019. As the ramp- up of the GBC and DMLZ underground operation reaches full capacity, PT-FI expects its average power demand to increase by 50MW to a total of 270MW annually (from a 2018 baseline year average of 220MW) for underground air ventilation and additional processing of the ore bodies. To support the additional energy requirements, PT-FI identified an opportunity to integrate a lower carbon power source at our operations with the development of a dual fuel power plant (DFPP) at our Arafura Sea port facility at Amamapare. The DFPP is currently under construction and will have an installed capacity of 129MW which will provide the additional power we believe is necessary for our operations as well as enable us to transition our older diesel generation equipment at the mill to backup status (from providing approximately 18% of our total power in our 2018 baseline year). Absent any unexpected delays, the DFPP is expected to be completed in the first half of 2022. The DFPP is designed using high-efficiency dual fuel reciprocating engines on a flexible platform that can operate on either diesel fuel or natural gas, providing PT-FI future optionality to adjust the fuel type and increase plant capacity as we seek to reduce our Scope 1 emissions by transitioning to a fuel with lower GHG emissions than coal. While the necessary infrastructure to deliver natural gas has not yet been developed, the PT-FI team is studying various options. PT-FI will initially use domestically produced biodiesel for the DFPP, as mandated by the government of Indonesia; however, we plan to evaluate other options in the future including LNG. We describe the additional potential decarbonization initiatives under evaluation for PT-FI in the Decarbonizing Electricity Supply section. Freeport is committed to reducing our GHG emissions by 30% per metric ton of payable copper in Indonesia by 2030, from our 2018 baseline.\n",
      "Pathway to 2030 – Scope 1 & 2 Multiple GHG emissions reduction initiatives are either already in process or are under evaluation across our global business. Collectively, these initiatives are the foundation that will help us develop and define our roadmap to achieve our current 2030 GHG emissions reduction targets. These initiatives fall into four primary categories: (1) decarbonizing our electricity supply by converting power supplies to renewable energy on the grid through power purchase agreements (PPAs) and through site-related renewables projects to reduce our emissions, (2) optimizing energy and asset efficiency, (3) electrification of equipment, and (4) process innovation. SUMMARY OF SCOPE 1 & 2 INITIATIVES INITIATIVES DETAILS SELECTED PROJECTS IN PROCESS AND/OR UNDER EVALUATION Decarbonizing Electricity Supply Purchased electricity generates just over 50% of the GHG emissions of our Americas operations. Renewable energy projects and PPAs in the southwestern United States (U.S.) are under evaluation and will be important to progressing our 2030 15% GHG emissions reduction target for the Americas. Freeport, in some cases, may provide the land for these projects. In some jurisdictions where we operate, such as Chile, we may benefit if we are using the local grid and renewables are added to it without our intervention. In Indonesia, a majority (~70%) of our current GHG emissions generated are a result of our coal-fired power plant. We will benefit from evaluating alternative fuel sources and flexibility for fuel switching in the future. • Progressing the first phase of Copper Skies (see pg. 16) to evaluate up to 450MW in renewable power projects (wind / solar / battery storage) and PPAs in the southwestern U.S. • Evaluating PPAs vs. grid transition in both Peru and Chile to incorporate more renewable content • Approved new 129MW DFPP at PT-FI; evaluating viability to use LNG • Atlantic Copper contracted new PPAs and constructed a new heat recovery boiler Energy & Asset Efficiency Increased energy and asset efficiency at our sites can help support both our operational- and emissions-related performance. For example, by providing our operators with predictive data from machine learning technology, we have successfully enhanced concentrator throughput and efficiency at certain of our sites. Freeport also has an extensive haul truck rebuild program to extend the life of our existing equipment, which avoids capital and the Scope 3 GHG emissions associated with manufacturing and delivering new haul trucks to our sites. Sites are also working to identify other potential efficiency projects tied to carbon emissions reductions. • Digital twin technology • Energy management systems • Improved metering • Improvements to high pressure grinding mill circuits • Haul Truck cycle-time improvements; Digital Haul Truck Operator Scorecards (HTOS) • Haul truck rebuild program to extend equipment life • Shovel optimization to increase efficiency and reduce energy use Electrification Electrification of our haul trucks and other ancillary and light duty equipment will be critical to decreasing our Scope 1 GHG emissions across our global operations. Today, there is not yet a commercially viable alternative to the diesel-fuel haul trucks used at our open-pit operations. Electrification of ancillary equipment and light duty vehicles can also support our efficiency and potentially reduce ventilation demands at our underground operations at PT-FI. • Komatsu and Caterpillar 400-ton class (diesel-electric) truck commitments have been made for trial and commissioning in early 2022 • Designed and built an autonomous electric train at PT-FI underground which is currently operational • Evaluating various options for electrifying ancillary and light duty equipment at both PT-FI and the Americas operations Process Innovation Through process innovations, we seek to identify and implement new leach technologies that enable us to advance operations technologically, often leading to reduced energy and GHG emissions. Our concentrate leach plant (CLP) innovation allows for the hydrometallurgical processing of copper sulfide concentrates and advanced processing of molybdenum concentrates. For copper, CLP allows us to skip the energy intensive smelting step and for molybdenum, CLP results in a more refined product directly at the mine site, rather than shipping overseas for processing. In both cases, CLP reduces associated energy and carbon emissions. • CLPs at Morenci and Bagdad are operational • Internal and external initiatives underway to advance sulfide leaching technologies and to drive continuous recovery improvement; focused on traditional ores and ores that had been considered difficult to leach, like chalcopyrite • In R&D phase and conducting in-field trials at existing leach stockpiles and future opportunities to recover copper from below mill cut-off grade material\n",
      "2020 CLIMATE REPORT / 16 DECARBONIZING ELECTRICITY SUPPLY Americas Purchased electricity generates just over half of our GHG emissions at our Americas operations, making this a critical focus area for our decarbonization efforts in the next decade. In South America, open electricity markets allow our operations to contract directly with energy generation suppliers. We believe this structure provides more opportunity, compared to our operations in North America, to more rapidly decarbonize our electricity supply by establishing new renewable energy contracts. At our Cerro Verde operations in Peru, we currently purchase power from various non-renewable and renewable sources (including natural gas and hydroelectric) through three PPAs. One of three Cerro Verde PPAs is due for renewal in 2025. We are currently planning for this contract renewal, and we will seek to incorporate additional renewable energy sources into this contract. At our El Abra operations in Chile, we have one PPA, primarily natural gas supply, in effect through 2029. The electricity grid in Chile has significantly reduced its carbon intensity in recent years, and we are currently evaluating how we can best accelerate our renewable energy supply within our existing PPA. In North America, we are a major retail customer of several electric utility companies. The absence of organized electric power markets in the southwestern region of the U.S. is a challenge to the pace of grid decarbonization due to both regulatory and commercial constraints that have historically restrained growth in the renewable energy markets. Despite this, we believe Freeport is well-positioned in North America to accelerate the delivery of renewable sources of electricity to our mine sites because we are vertically integrated into the electricity value-chain. Freeport delivers approximately 70% of our own electrical energy needs through wholesale contracts and has the ability to directly contract with developers to secure renewable energy to help achieve our goals. In recent years, Freeport has studied opportunities to integrate renewable energy supplies including solar, wind and energy storage at our Americas operations. In 2018 and 2019, we engaged the Rocky Mountain Institute (RMI) through their Sunshine for Mines Program to assist with identifying a pipeline of conceptual projects to support our energy needs ranging from hosting renewable projects on our own land to the development of off-site projects. Project plans were temporarily paused in 2020 while we navigated the uncertainty of COVID-19 and focused on establishing our GHG emissions reduction target for Freeport Americas Copper operations. However, we have since refocused and worked to further evaluate and develop a portfolio of renewable energy projects in the Americas – including some of those identified in the RMI study – which we refer to as Copper Skies. The first phase of Copper Skies aims to establish renewable energy projects in Arizona and New Mexico with the potential to integrate up to 450MW of renewable capacity into our power supply. The projects under evaluation include wind, solar and energy storage and have the potential to be integrated into our operations within the next five years. We plan to work with new and existing energy partners to advance these projects, decarbonize our electricity supply and drive value for our business. Simultaneously, we will aim to identify opportunities with our retail electricity providers to replace long-term contracts with new, renewable energy supplies. In 2021, a green tariff with Salt River Project in Arizona, signed in 2018, began providing renewable energy to our Miami operations. We believe that opportunities such as green tariffs and the initial phase of Copper Skies will help us to advance our decarbonization efforts, potentially helping us realize up to a third of our 15% Americas GHG emissions intensity reduction target. Team members install solar panels at our Bagdad operation in Arizona.\n",
      "Indonesia As noted in the Climate Reduction Targets section, PT-FI is currently building a 129MW Duel Fuel Power Plant (DFPP), with expected completion in 2022. The new DFPP will support the additional energy required as the underground operations ramp-up to full capacity. The new DFPP will provide the additional capacity at an improved carbon intensity versus additional installed coal units and we also are evaluating other long-term potential options to further reduce the carbon emissions for PT-FI. While we plan to initially use biodiesel to fuel the DFPP, we are studying the feasibility of switching the fuel supply to LNG, which could further reduce GHG emissions and provide other benefits, including potential energy cost savings. We believe transitioning from diesel to LNG could also support a significant reduction in PT-FI's NOX emissions at the port. The team also has initiated work to evaluate the potential to retrofit PT-FI’s existing coal-fired power plant to accept LNG for power generation as well as the potential for a full replacement of the port’s coal-fired power plant with a new high-efficiency, combined-cycle power plant, which would use cleaner burning energy sources, such as natural gas, to produce electricity. Preliminary internal assessments evaluating the use of renewable energy generation sources to power all of PT-FI’s operations are underway. There are challenges; wind resources are poor in the region and while solar resources could be economically viable in certain applications, the opportunities are small in scale. Hydroelectric generation resources exist near our operations and in other areas in Papua; however, due to the high capital costs and long development times, we do not currently believe this option is viable in part due to PT-FI’s current 2041 mining license timeframe. The PT-FI team will continue to investigate renewable energy generation options to determine viability at both small- and large-scale. ATLANTIC COPPER SMELTING & REFINING Our Atlantic Copper operations in Spain process over 1 million metric tons of copper concentrate annually. According to Wood Mackenzie, Atlantic Copper is benchmarked as one of the most energy efficient smelters in the world, despite being built in the 1970s. Atlantic Copper was the first copper smelter in the world to be certified to ISO 50001 Energy Management System. Over the past decade, Atlantic Copper has improved upon its industry-leading energy efficiency by almost 20% per metric ton of material processed. Atlantic Copper currently consumes 28% of its electricity from renewable sources or on-site, high-efficiency cogeneration and aims to increase its consumption of these sources to 60% in 2024 through additional PPAs and a new heat recovery boiler, which was completed in March 2021. Atlantic Copper Smelting & Refinery was awarded the Copper Mark in 2020.\n",
      "ENERGY & ASSET EFFICIENCY Energy Efficiency Three years ago, we began investing in digital twin technology, which uses machine learning to study how equipment has historically operated and then provides predictive instructions to operators to support higher efficiencies and throughput moving forward. We completed the first trials for the digital twin technology at the concentrator at our Bagdad operations in Arizona in 2018. After applying the technology at Bagdad, the concentrator realized a 13% improvement in throughput. Since this initial success, we have applied the digital twin technology to other concentrators across our Americas business, including at our Cerro Verde concentrating facilities, which have seen a 2% increase in recovery as a result. The gains achieved with the benefit of the digital twins are generated at a fraction of the incremental energy that would otherwise be required to add more equipment to expand capacity. Overall, our processing plants operate more efficiently with digital twin technology integration, resulting in fewer GHG emissions per ton of copper produced. Asset Management & Optimization Longer, steeper haul truck routes and additional truck runs are required as mines age and ore grades decline, both of which impact a mine’s GHG emissions intensity. As ore grades decline, more energy is used to mine and process lower-grade material compared to the energy used to produce the same amount of metal from higher-grade material. Declining ore grades are an industry-wide challenge, which Freeport has sought to address, in part, through our innovative asset optimization practices. Over the last decade, we have become leaders in asset optimization – maximizing the lives of our haul trucks and enabling each truck to operate well beyond the industry average. At our Americas operations, we measure each haul truck’s actual cycle-time versus the plan and provide suggestions for improvement. Better haul truck cycle-times can help decrease the number of haul trucks required to move material. Fewer haul trucks mean lower capital, operational and energy expenditures, which can also result in lower GHG emissions. Further, over the last two years, Freeport has deployed a unique Haul Truck Operator Scorecard (HTOS) system to engage and involve our equipment operators in solutions. By putting the operational data collected by the HTOS directly in the hands of our operators, they are better able to gauge and improve their day-to-day performance by adjusting their driving practices, increasing safety and saving time. ASSET OPTIMIZATION EFFORTS HAVE: Improved the average cycle-time of our haulage fleets at our Americas operations by more than 3 minutes. Eliminated a total of 126,000 operating hours from our haulage fleets year over year in 2020. OPERATING HOURS SAVED EQUATES TO ~6,000,000 GALLONS OF FUEL SAVED. OR 66,000 METRIC TONS OF CO2 EQUIVALENT, REDUCING OUR ANNUAL AMERICAS SCOPE 1 EMISSIONS BY ~3%. WE EXPECT TO ELIMINATE AN ADDITIONAL 213,000 OPERATING HOURS IN 2021. 2020 CLIMATE REPORT / 18\n",
      "EQUIPMENT ELECTRIFICATION Equipment electrification offers significant opportunities to decarbonize at both our open-pit and underground mines, by switching from less efficient fuel combustion and leveraging our electricity decarbonization efforts. Americas At our Americas operations, we are evaluating diesel-electric, ultra-class haul trucks to potentially integrate into our decarbonization roadmap for our open-pit mines. These high-payload-capacity, diesel-electric haul trucks can provide immediate benefits such as reduced unit costs, increased load capacity, and reduced energy consumption and GHG emissions. They also can provide us with a more flexible platform for the future. In order to evaluate performance, we have made commitments to trial and commission both Komatsu and Caterpillar 400-ton class diesel-electric trucks at our Cerro Verde operations in Peru, starting in early 2022. Indonesia As our Grasberg operations transitioned from open-pit to underground mining operations, PT-FI designed and built an autonomous electric train system to move ore through underground tunnels rather than traditional, diesel- powered trucks. The GBC mine is planned to be the largest block caving operation in the world with a sustained peak capacity of 130,000 metric tons per day. The GBC is ramping up, with current production rates in second quarter 2021 averaging 64,400 metric tons per day as well as days with production over 100,000 metric tons per day. The GBC was designed and built with an electrified rail haulage system. This ultimately will consist of just over 14 miles of underground track, an overhead catenary system (OCS) and pantographs mounted on the locomotives. The locomotives also have onboard batteries that are used in locations where the OCS cannot be deployed. The batteries recharge when the locomotive reconnects to the OCS system. Each train consists of one, 30 metric ton locomotive and 11 ore cars. There are currently six trains operating with a plan for 14 at peak production. Each train can carry around 300 metric tons of ore per trip, which is the equivalent of a surface haul truck. The trains are fully autonomous and drive themselves to and from the loading chutes and unloading stations. The ore cars are loaded remotely by operators at a surface control room. This is a highly efficient method of gathering the mined ore and transporting it to the crushers, and this method greatly reduces the ventilation loading that would have been present with a fleet of 50-60 metric ton diesel underground trucks performing the same task. Finally, from a carbon perspective, this results in an approximately 80,000 metric ton net reduction in CO2 equivalent per year (excluding Scope 3 and at full capacity) versus a comparable fleet of diesel trucks designed to do the same task. As we move forward, we also plan to look for opportunities to electrify additional underground equipment at PT-FI and ancillary equipment at our sites in the Americas. Rather than using traditional, diesel-power trucks, PT-FI's autonomous electric trains can move the same amount of material through the underground tunnels as one surface haul truck.\n",
      "2020 CLIMATE REPORT / 20 COLLABORATING FOR INNOVATION Freeport recognizes that mining companies and Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) must work together collaboratively in order to develop and advance technologies that will support industry-wide decarbonization. Freeport is actively leveraging its existing strategic partnerships with its OEMs to better understand their emissions goals and objectives for haulage as well as other critical equipment. For example, we are actively engaged with a number of consortiums that bring together industry leaders with OEMs to work together to develop innovate solutions. In 2021, we joined The Charge on Innovation Challenge (The Challenge) as a patron supporter. The Challenge is a global competition expected to drive technology innovators across all industries to develop new concepts and solutions for large-scale haul truck electrification systems aimed at significantly cutting emissions from surface mining. The Challenge also aims to demonstrate an emerging market for charging solutions in mining, accelerate commercialization of solutions and integrate innovations from other industries into the mining sector. Through our membership in ICMM, we participate in the Innovation for Cleaner, Safer Vehicles (ICSV) initiative. The goal of the ICSV is to accelerate the development of a new generation of mining vehicles and improve existing ones in order to introduce GHG emission-free surface mining vehicles by 2040, to minimize the operational impact of diesel exhaust by 2025 and to develop vehicle collision avoidance technology for the mining industry by 2025. Freeport has also joined two consortiums in South America, H2-Chile and H2-Peru, which are both collaborative efforts between public, private and academic entities focused on enabling the use of hydrogen in haul trucks. An autonomous electric train system moves ore through underground tunnels at our PT-FI operations in Indonesia. Remotely operating underground mining equipment reduces workforce exposure to ground failure, wet muck spills and air contaminants in addition to lowering GHG emissions.\n",
      "PROCESS INNOVATION Our earliest successes in processing innovation were in the development of large-scale copper leaching and recovery through solvent extraction / electrowinning (SX / EW) in the 1980s. SX / EW produces copper cathode without milling or smelting of concentrates, saving approximately 30% in energy consumption per ton of copper produced, with a similar reduction in GHG emissions. This innovative process has revolutionized copper mining, extending the lives of mines that would have been deemed too uneconomic for investment. In 2020, approximately 45% of our copper cathode production in the Americas was produced through the SX / EW process. Where SX / EW is not an option, we have invested in innovative grinding technologies to enable our mill expansion projects to significantly improve energy efficiency. These technologies use high-pressure grinding technology to reduce ore rock size as opposed to traditional ball mills. Currently, 60% of the copper milled at our Americas operations annually is processed using this newer technology. Because of these investments, we expect to realize energy and carbon savings for years to come. Similarly, we have applied our electrowinning processing expertise to our sulfide concentrates. By using an innovative concentrate leach process for our sulfide concentrates, we avoid the need for smelting our copper and roasting our molybdenum concentrates. We are one of only a few copper mining companies to use this technology, and we own intellectual property rights for processing molybdenum in this way. This concentrate leach process is lower in cost and energy, helping to reduce our carbon footprint. Data analytics that we have utilized in the milling process are now being applied in leaching. Emerging leaching technology provides substantial opportunities for added growth across our portfolio of global resources. Investments in these new leaching technologies could increase ore recoveries over time.\n",
      "MOLYBDENUM OPERATIONS Freeport is vertically integrated for 100% of our molybdenum production and is the largest producer of molybdenum globally. We have two primary molybdenum mines in Colorado (Henderson and Climax), and we also have by-product molybdenum production from multiple copper mines (Cerro Verde, Morenci, Sierrita and Bagdad). We roast molybdenum concentrates at our Sierrita operations in Arizona and our Fort Madison facility in Iowa, with roasting and subsequent conversion at our Rotterdam facility in the Netherlands. We produce a ferro-molybdenum product at a plant in Stowmarket, England. In 2020, we began engaging with our molybdenum value chain on climate-related topics. We anticipate that both our primary and by-product molybdenum products will benefit from our decarbonization efforts in the Americas. Our by-product molybdenum emissions are already included in our existing 15% GHG emissions intensity reduction target for the Americas Copper business and in the latter half of 2021, we aim to develop an additional GHG emissions reduction target for our primary molybdenum mines and downstream processing facilities. 2020 CLIMATE REPORT / 22 Freeport is vertically integrated for 100% of our molybdenum production and is the largest producer of molybdenum globally, a critical component in stainless steel and a variety of renewable energy technologies such as wind and solar. Pictured here are our Bagdad operations in Arizona.\n",
      "Scope 3 Scope 3 emissions occur both upstream and downstream from our operations within the value chain. Upstream Scope 3 emissions result from production of materials and fuels that we use in our processing such as lime, explosives, chemical reagents and diesel, and downstream emissions result from transport, further refining or transforming of our copper into useable products, such as wire or sheet. Overall, Scope 3 emissions for copper are relatively low compared to many other metals because the downstream production of copper requires comparatively less energy, given the minimal downstream processing required to transform copper concentrate into cathode and cathode into various forms, such as wire for electrical cables. For some metals, Scope 3 emissions can be multiple times their Scope 1 and 2 emissions. However, our current Scope 3 emissions estimates represent a smaller proportion than our Scope 1 and 2 emissions. Our estimated Scope 3 emissions currently represent 19% of our aggregate Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions. As we continue our work to enhance our Scope 3 calculations and add additional relevant categories, we anticipate further increases in our Scope 3 emissions estimates next year. We expect that Scope 3 emissions will comprise approximately one- third of our combined global Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions. Because Scope 3 emissions are generated by other parties (i.e., they are other companies’ Scope 1 and 2 emissions) they are more difficult to estimate accurately. While the GHG Protocol provides standardization of Scope 3 emissions into 15 categories, it does not provide specific guidance for the mining and metals industry on how to best estimate GHG emissions. In 2020 and first half of 2021, we enhanced and expanded our Scope 3 emissions calculations to include additional categories in line with the GHG Protocol. Freeport is currently participating in projects with both the International Copper Association (ICA) and ICMM to support the development of industry-specific guidance that can drive a consistent approach for companies in the mining and metals industry. UNDERSTANDING OUR FOOTPRINT Freeport has estimated select Scope 3 emissions categories for many years. In 2020, we initiated a process to improve our existing Scope 3 emissions estimates and add additional categories, in line with the GHG Protocol. To accomplish this, during 2020 and the first half of 2021, Freeport worked closely with industry partners and associations, focusing on the most material categories of Scope 3 emissions to our value chain including: purchased goods and services (Category 1), upstream fuel production (Category 3), transport of our commercial products to our customers (Category 9) and downstream processing of sold copper concentrates and anodes (Category 10). Our revised 2020 Scope 3 emissions calculations include the following adjustments: › Category 3 Fuel and energy-related activities: We have added an estimate of emissions related to the upstream production of diesel, used not only for the movement of our haul truck fleet but also in the generation of energy in our remote site in Indonesia, which resulted in an increase of approximately 225,000 metric tons of CO2 equivalent. We expect to add additional upstream fuel emissions in the future. › Category 9 Downstream transport: We have added an estimate of downstream emissions for the transport of our concentrates to customers around the world, which resulted in an increase of approximately 336,000 metric tons of CO2 equivalent. › Category 10 Processing of sold products: We have updated our approach to calculating downstream processing to be more fulsome. We continue to base our estimates for this category by averaging performance at our two smelters / refineries and applying the result to total concentrate sold. Previously, this estimation included only stationary combustion emissions from smelting and refining and was therefore underestimating the total, which has resulted in an increase of approximately 550,000 metric tons of CO2 equivalent. A summary of our revised 2020 Scope 3 emissions estimates is provided in the table on the following page. Our Scope 3 emissions calculation effort is ongoing with the aim of identifying and reporting across all relevant Scope 3 emissions sources in 2022.\n",

      "Farmers near our Cerro Verde operation in Peru practice sustainable agriculture and are supported by the company through a variety of business development and training programs. Enhancing resilience to climate risks is important for our operations, our host communities and our stakeholders.\n",
      "2020 CLIMATE REPORT / 26 Resilience Freeport strives to enhance our resilience to both physical and transitional risks associated with climate change for our operations, our host communities and our stakeholders. This includes working to analyze and prepare for extreme weather events, water stress and other climate change impacts. This section seeks to provide our stakeholders insights into the climate risks and opportunities we have identified that may impact our business over various time horizons as well as our strategic process for identifying and assessing climate risks. We have adopted the TCFD’s categorization of climate-related risks as either “transition” or “physical” climate risks. Transition risks are those climate-related risks arising out of governmental, market or other actions associated with the transition to a low-carbon economy. These may include events such as a change in general consumer preferences, the implementation of climate-progressive governmental regulations, the deployment of clean energy technologies or an increase in legal liability for high carbon-emitting entities. Physical risks are those climate-related risks that arise from the physical impacts of climate change. As in the TCFD framework, Freeport considers these risks to be either chronic, such as long-term variability in weather patterns, or acute, such as individual extreme weather events such as floods or short-term droughts. In addition to risks, climate-related opportunities could come in the form of a change to market and consumer preferences that benefit the company, an expected increase in the availability of renewables, new markets or new operational locations, an expected increase in demand for certain products, or a competitive advantage in certain scenarios when compared with peers or other circumstances. In 2020, we initiated our first global climate scenario analysis with support from a third-party consultant to identify potential climate-related risks and opportunities across our business. The goal of the analysis was to gather additional data to inform our ongoing climate-related decision-making and better prepare the company for possible outcomes in the short- (2021 – 2025), medium- (2025 – 2030) and long-term (2030 and beyond). We are confident in our ability to adapt to a wide variety of future scenarios and know that preparation is an important means to ensure operational and financial resiliency for an uncertain future. We identified certain risks and opportunities through a series of internal interviews with key business unit representatives from across the global business and a review of our sustainability risk register that integrates climate-related risk reporting on recent and historic events and climate- related impacts and exposures. Following this internal assessment, we identified the priority risks and opportunities listed on the following page.\n",
      "SCENARIO SELECTION We evaluated the key risks and opportunities outlined above across three different climate scenarios: Current State (i.e., mostly unconstrained GHG emissions), Moderate Climate Action (i.e., moderately constrained GHG emissions) and Aggressive Climate Action (i.e., action in line with the Paris Agreement goals of limiting global temperature rise to well below 2ºC, preferably to 1.5ºC, compared to preindustrial levels). Our scenario analysis was conducted using the prospective time periods of 2030 and 2050 and incorporating a range of business considerations based on third-party GHG emissions trajectory scenarios and their corresponding implications for Freeport. Physical risks were evaluated mainly using data from the Fifth Phase of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5) which was used in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Fifth Assessment Report. Our scenario analysis covered our operational and non-operational assets as well as our supply chain. PRIORITY RISKS & OPPORTUNITIES DESCRIPTION OF IDENTIFIED CLIMATE RISKS & OPPORTUNITIES IMPACT TIMING FINANCIAL IMPACTS Policy Risks: Compliance with new governmental regulations to incentivize decarbonization and emissions reductions may require capital expenditures or modified operations and may impact mining economics. Evolving carbon pricing policies could increase the cost of doing business from direct and supply chain emissions or could impact the competitiveness of Freeport’s commodities. Short- to long-term Potential increase in compliance and operating costs Market Opportunities: Expanded electrification from market and regulatory drivers and increased customer demands for low-carbon products may increase market demand for copper and molybdenum. Short- to long-term Potential increase in production and revenue Market Risks: A future with reduced oil and gas demand may negatively impact the security of our sulfur supply (since sulfur is a by-product of oil and gas processing), which is a critical operating material for Freeport. Reduced sulfur supply may constrain our operational capacities. Medium- to long-term Potential increased operating costs and production reductions Technology Risks: The path to decarbonization requires significant capital investment and operational transformation. Efforts to decarbonize may require the use of unproven technologies, the selection and implementation of which may be time and resource intensive. Medium- to long-term Potential capital investments and resource expenditures to decarbonize Physical Risks: Event driven (acute) or long-term shifts in climate patterns (chronic) may lead to direct or indirect impacts to our business through disruptions to our operations, workforce, communities and logistics supply chain.

      "Transition Risks & Opportunities Freeport selected specific transition risks and opportunities arising due to policy, product and technology changes for further analysis. The data evaluated in this analysis was sourced from the International Energy Agency (IEA) World Energy Outlook energy demand and carbon pricing modeling, external market analysis, such as those developed by Wood Mackenzie, CRU, and World Bank and internal Freeport forecasts. Overall, our analysis indicated that although Freeport is prepared for the potential growth in copper demand, we must continue to monitor evolving carbon and energy policies and prices and evaluate the potential implications on our operations to prepare for the impacts of such changes on our business. We plan to monitor policies in the main countries and regions where policies and incentives are projected to become more aggressive, such as the U.S., Europe and Chile.

      "AGGRESSIVE CLIMATE ACTION (1.5°C) SCENARIO This scenario is characterized by global collaboration to reduce GHG emissions in alignment with the Paris Agreement goals and reduce emission to net zero by 2050 and further limiting the global temperature increase by the year 2100 to around 1.5°C. Description This scenario assumes: (i) global energy-related and industrial process CO2 emissions fall by nearly 40% between 2020 and 2030 and become net zero in 2050, (ii) the market sees an accelerated transition to renewables and electrification, and (iii) governments implement aggressive regulations to limit the extraction and use of fossil fuels in most sectors and all major economies, including carbon pricing. In addition, energy efficiency, wind and solar photovoltaic production methods would provide around half of the necessary emissions reductions until 2030. After 2030, decarbonization would continue with increased electrification, hydrogen use and carbon capture, utilization and storage (CCUS) deployment. Importantly, this scenario assumes the deployment of technologies not widely available on a commercial scale today. Carbon Prices (U.S. dollars / metric ton CO2e) In advanced economies, assume $130 by 2030 and $250 by 2050; in select emerging markets and developing economies (China, Brazil, Russia, South Africa), assume $90 by 2030 and $200 by 2050; in other emerging markets and developing economies, assume $15 by 2030 and $55 by 2050. Renewables • Solar photovoltaic and wind are the leading sources of electricity in 2030; and provide 70% of electricity generation globally in 2050 • 60% of global car sales are electric by 2030 and 50% of heavy truck sales are electric and no new internal combustion engine car sales by 2035 Fossil Fuels • Phase out of unabated coal in advanced economies by 2030, and phase out of all unabated coal and oil power plants by 2040 • By 2050, up to 75% projected decline in oil and gas demand; remaining fossil fuels used in production of nonenergy goods (like plastics), in plants with CCUS, and in sectors where low emissions options are scarce Reference Scenarios • Transition Risks & Opportunities: IEA Net Zero Emissions by 2050 • Physical Risks: IPCC Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 2.6 PT-FI's Amamapare port facility in Papua, Indonesia was included in our our global climate scenario analysis.\n",
      "2020 CLIMATE REPORT / 30 PRIMARY RISKS FOR FREEPORT › Technology Risks: Our operations are dependent on the use of heavy equipment for which low-carbon alternatives are not currently readily available. To the extent that carbon pricing, or GHG emissions limitations are imposed upon our operations or implemented as a result of our voluntary commitments, we could face significant expenses to replace mining equipment or purchase carbon offsets, which would reduce our Scope 1 emissions but increase operational costs. › Policy Risks: Changes in regulations could accelerate a reduction in both our Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions and result in increased costs. For example, proposals are underway for a carbon border adjustment mechanism in Europe as part of the E.U. Green Deal. Freeport could be impacted and face potential loss of clients or increases in the cost of selling to European manufacturers affected by this tax scheme (such as metal suppliers of the auto and electronics industries). Our most carbon-intensive assets have the highest carbon price exposure risk under this scenario, including PT-FI, which currently relies predominately on coal-based power, and our larger Americas mining assets at Cerro Verde and Morenci. The surge in policies under this scenario could push us to invest capital at a faster pace to decarbonize our operations. › Sulfur Costs: We may face challenges from supply deficits and price volatility. Specifically, Freeport may have to manage through a disruption to sulfur supply if demand for oil and gas sharply declines, and refineries and natural gas processing plants that produce sulfur are decommissioned. Shipping costs could be negatively impacted if Freeport were required to source sulfur from alternative vendors or regions. Sulfur is necessary for sulfuric acid production, an essential material for SX / EW (leached) copper production for which fossil fuel production is the low-cost producer. To date, Freeport has successfully managed prior disruptions in the sulfur market through supplier diversification, on-site storage, contingency plans and risk management in vendor agreements. PRIMARY OPPORTUNITIES FOR FREEPORT › Energy Sources: The rapid drop in fossil fuel demand and acceleration of renewable energy deployment under this scenario leads to significantly lower prices for the energy needed to power our operations – both in oil and gas and renewable energy. Improvements in technology, such as storage and faster deployment of clean energy in this scenario, may lead to reduction in the levelized cost of renewable energy and may make it even more attractive for us to switch to renewable energy at our sites. › Demand: Both copper and molybdenum are anticipated to perform more strongly under this scenario given consumer demand for inputs to manufacture the primary technologies deployed in a highly electrified and low-carbon economy, including wind turbines, solar photovoltaics, electric vehicles, electronic equipment, cables, wiring and transformers. › Prices: The IEA projects the value of the copper market to increase from $35.5 billion in 2020 to $149 billion by 2050. Overall, the total market size of critical minerals such as copper, cobalt, manganese and various rare earth metals is expected to grow almost sevenfold between 2020 and 2030 in the net zero pathway. Molybdenum sees a similar increase in such projections given its use in various renewable energy technologies and steel. › Growth: The projected increase in demand for copper and molybdenum may create opportunities for Freeport to grow and increase production over the coming decades, for example by making more reserves economic to produce. As demonstrated by initiatives such as Freeport’s mining innovations and Copper Mark certifications, Freeport also could continue to seek out ways to advance sustainable operations to differentiate itself and create competitive advantages as compared to its peer companies during this transition.\n",
      "MODERATE CLIMATE ACTION (2.5°C) SCENARIO This scenario considers a curb in global GHG emissions based on existing policies and announced commitments including Nationally Determined Contributions, but efforts fall short of meeting the Paris Agreement targets with disorderly progress. Under this scenario, the global economy would moderately constrain GHG emissions limiting the global temperature increase by the year 2100 to around 2.5°C. PRIMARY RISKS FOR FREEPORT › Policy Risks: In this scenario, in the regions where Freeport operates, carbon pricing policies would remain limited but carbon prices would increase, thereby increasing Freeport’s cost exposure, but to a lesser extent than the Aggressive Climate Action (1.5°C) Scenario. › Physical Risks: Although less than in the Current State scenario, potential risks associated with the physical impacts of climate change could impact the company’s operations, supply chain, workforce and local communities as a result of this scenario. These risks are expanded upon in the following physical risk assessment review. › Sulfur Costs: Under this scenario, it is possible that Freeport may have to manage changes in sources of sulfur supply but likely to a lesser extent than the Aggressive Climate Action (1.5°C) Scenario. PRIMARY OPPORTUNITIES FOR FREEPORT › Energy Sources: The expansion of renewables over the next two decades, led by continued high levels of solar photovoltaic deployment, would lead to a price reduction. Decarbonization incentives and policies would be announced, particularly in easier-to-abate sectors, leading to opportunities for Freeport to purchase renewable energy or develop on-site renewables. › Demand: Copper and molybdenum are expected to perform strongly under this scenario due to the increased investment in technologies that support decarbonization of the energy and transportation sectors, which could provide additional opportunities for increased production, mining expansion and innovation. The potential for copper supply shortages would likely be less severe in this scenario. Description This scenario assumes: (i) the majority of energy sources are renewable-based, although coal would continue to play an important role in electricity generation in emerging economies to 2050, and (ii) carbon prices would rise in certain Freeport operating regions. This scenario also anticipates a divergence between the advanced economies and the emerging market and developing economies, with advanced economies seeing greater technological progress, reduced energy demand and cleaner fuel switching and emerging economies seeing economic growth and urbanization and infrastructure expansion, outweighing improvements in energy efficiency and clean technology deployment. Carbon Prices (U.S. dollars / metric ton CO2e) In certain FCX operating regions (Chile, Europe and the U.K.), pricing ranges between $8 and $35 by 2030; between $20 and $52 by 2040. Renewables • 55% of global electricity generation in 2050 mainly driven by solar photovoltaic and wind Fossil Fuels • Coal continues to play an important role in electricity generation in emerging economies to 2050, with demand in power and industry sectors expected to grow in India, Indonesia and other countries in southeast Asia • Global oil demand returns to pre-COVID-19 pandemic levels around 2023, with increase up to 2030 and leveling in 2050 • Natural gas demand projected to quickly recover post COVID-19 pandemic and be nearly 15% higher in 2030 than in 2019 and almost 50% higher in 2050 Reference Scenarios • Transition Risks & Opportunities: IEA Stated Policies Scenario reference scenario • Physical Risks: IPCC RCP 4.5\n",
      "2020 CLIMATE REPORT / 32 CURRENT STATE (4°C) SCENARIO This scenario considers a baseline for how global emissions would evolve if governments and markets make no changes to their existing policies or low- carbon investments and fail to meet their Nationally Determined Contributions. Under this scenario, the global economy would maintain business as usual without constraining GHG emissions anticipating the global temperature increases by the year 2100 to around 4.0°C. PRIMARY RISKS FOR FREEPORT › Physical Risks: The greatest risks to Freeport in this scenario arise from the physical impacts of climate change on the company’s operations and supply chain and the impacts on our workforce and local communities. These risks are expanded upon in the following physical risk assessments review. PRIMARY OPPORTUNITIES FOR FREEPORT › Demand: Copper demand is expected to grow under this scenario, resulting from existing growth trajectories in the use of renewable energy technologies, albeit at lower rates than our other two scenarios. Description This scenario assumes limited emissions reduction policies and a lack of global coordination to address climate change. In comparison to the Moderate Climate Action scenario, this scenario assumes that countries fail to deliver on announced policies under the Nationally Determined Contributions and fall well-short of their stated ambitions, leading to increased GHG emissions and physical risks relative to the other scenarios we considered. Furthermore, the slow pace of transition leads to an insufficient momentum behind clean energy deployment to offset the effects of an expanding global economy and growing population. Effects of climate change become more visible and require significant investments in adaptation measures to protect assets, infrastructure, communities and workforce in the long-term. This scenario also assumes no- or low-carbon prices, continued reliance on fossil fuels, and energy-intensive activities and lifestyles. Carbon Prices (U.S. dollars / metric ton CO2e) Policies and carbon pricing initiatives remain remain relatively low. In certain FCX operating regions (Chile, Europe, and the U.K.), pricing ranges between $0 and $30, which would minimally impact FCX. Renewables • With the slow transition to low-carbon, solar and wind renewables account for less than 30% of global electricity production by 2050, and the sale of electric vehicles grows at a slow pace Fossil Fuels • Continued reliance on fossil fuels, and energy intensive activities and lifestyles • Continued major share of oil and gas in the global economy, and increased demand despite short-term decrease in demand from the COVID-19 pandemic Reference Scenarios • Transition Risks & Opportunities: IEA Current Policies Scenario • Physical Risks: IPCC RCP 8.5\n",
      "Physical Risk Assessment Freeport recognizes that as the climate changes, our operations, workforce and supply chain may be exposed to changes in the frequency, intensity and/ or duration of intense storms, drought, flooding, wildfire, and other extreme weather events and patterns. To better prepare ourselves for the future and enhance our resilience, we assessed the current and potential future exposure of our assets and supply chain to climate-related physical hazards. The data underlying our physical risk assessment include: (i) historic and future projections from 10 Coupled Model Intercomparison Project 5 (CMIP5) global climate models, (ii) the IPCC Fifth Assessment Report and peer-reviewed scientific journal publications, and (iii) datasets from NASA, The Global Facility for Disaster Reduction and Recovery (ThinkHazard), the World Resources Institute and others. The CMIP5 global climate model projections were used to estimate our potential future physical risk under RCPs 2.6, 4.5 and 8.5. We selected physical hazards for analysis based on stakeholder interviews, internal documentation describing historic impacts and historical data from the sources listed above. The recently released 2021 IPCC Sixth Assessment Report utilizes data from the Sixth Phase of the CMIP (CMIP6), which features a number of improved, and some new, modeling aspects. The release of CMIP6 occurred several months after the completion of our physical risk assessment. While we anticipate using CMIP6 data for future climate scenario analysis assessments, we believe that for the purposes of this assessment, the use of CMIP5 data is appropriate for our screening of the key physical hazards that could potentially impact Freeport’s sites and supply chain. The physical risk assessment undertaken provides us with an initial screening of projected ranges of our potential risk. The use of global climate models to project future impacts is subject to a number of limitations. Such an approach lacks the spatial and temporal precision that will ultimately be necessary to conduct detailed engineering analyses to assess how local climate impacts may require us to alter our operations. Freeport is committed to continuing to improve our assessment of physical climate risks over time as more high-quality, site-relevant and decision-useful climate model results and data become available. At present, we plan to focus our initial work on those regions and risk factors that have emerged as highest priority from this initial screening assessment of physical climate risks. PHYSICAL RISK EXPOSURE ANALYSIS To assess our vulnerability to physical risks, we created a future exposure rating that examines four primary physical hazards based on the geographic location of each site and the potential future exposure change relative to historic exposure. The table on the following page describes our physical risk exposure benchmarks and ratings for each hazard. As noted previously, we recognize that the climate models used in this initial analysis have limitations, and as such, we present percentage increases of these metrics for the purposes of risk ranking rather than an explicit risk calculation. It is also important to acknowledge that the model projections used in our initial assessment produced a wide range of projected changes over the baseline, with results varying from negative change (e.g., reduction of maximum one day rainfall) to positive change (e.g., increase of maximum one day rainfall). We evaluated the model results using the multi-model ensemble median and not individual model projections in order to reduce biases and provide a higher-quality output than what would be associated with an individual model.\n",

      "PROJECTED CHANGES IN PHYSICAL RISK EXPOSURE VS. TODAY Freeport sites are currently exposed to multiple physical risk hazards that are projected to potentially increase or decrease under future scenarios. Following completion of the physical risk exposure analysis, we identified four main themes that we aim to integrate into our climate resiliency strategy going forward. These themes include: wet extremes, heat extremes, emerging water stress and sea level rise. Across each of the four main themes, the analysis sought to capture the assets with the highest projected future increase in exposure to these themes versus current exposure today. The trends noted in this map are overall changes across the majority of the scenarios and time horizons. Further analysis is required with more localized models to better understand and take appropriate action on these potential risks. SPAIN Sea level rise: Atlantic Copper operations may be exposed to an increase in events associated with rising sea levels ARIZONA Wet extremes: currently exposed to significant rainfall events; impacts anticipated to increase in the future Heat extremes: projected to experience large future increases in heatwave days, overall declines in annual rainfall and extended periods without rain PERU Emerging water stress: projected to experience increased water stress, combined with longer periods without rain CHILE Heat extremes: potential to experience significant future increases in heatwave days Emerging water stress: currently experiences extended periods without rainfall and has an extremely high water stress rating; water stress projected to increase in the future, combined with longer periods without rain INDONESIA Wet extremes: Papua currently experiences the highest rainfall out of all our operations, averaging approximately 200 inches annually Sea level rise: our Amamapare port is projected to see the largest increase in extreme events associated with sea level rise\n"

      "2020 CLIMATE REPORT / 36 EXAMPLES OF POTENTIAL PHYSICAL RISK EXPOSURES Wet & Heat Extremes: Arizona Our facilities in Arizona currently have a “moderate to high” exposure to significant rainfall events. Under the Current State (4°C) scenario, a 2°C rate of warming reached by 2050 could result in an approximate 20% increase in frequency and 5% increase in intensity, with a 20% projected increase in the total precipitation during each event. Our facilities in Arizona are also projected to experience large future increases in heat wave days, overall declines in annual rainfall and extended periods without rain. In all three scenarios, Arizona is projected to experience an increase of 25 to 69 days in long heat waves by 2050, with the magnitude of the change depending on scenario. Under a Moderate Climate Action (2.5°C) scenario, our facilities also are projected to experience a 5% to 11% decline in total annual rainfall by 2050. We are in the process of conducting additional localized studies to refine these data, which will enable us to revisit internal guidelines for infrastructure and operating procedures. Emerging Water Stress: Chile & Peru Our operations in Chile could experience significant future increases in heat wave days, extended periods without rain and increased water stress. The projected increases are most significant under a Current State (4°C) scenario. In addition, our operations in Peru also are projected to experience increased water stress, combined with longer periods without rain. These increases are projected under both the Moderate Climate Action (2.5°C) and Current State (4°C) scenarios. At both operations, we have previously designated water stress as a significant future issue and will continue working to address the risks these potential changes pose to our business. Sea Level Rise: Indonesia & Spain We also analyzed the projected exposures of our coastal operations to sea level rise. PT-FI’s Amamapare port and our Atlantic Copper smelter and refinery are exposed to rising sea levels with Indonesia, located in the warm tropics, projected to be at a significant potential risk of extreme events linked to sea level rise. This could lead to significant disruption to the timely delivery of essential materials to PT-FI and exports of commodities to our markets. It also exposes the coastal power plant that supplies PT-FI’s energy to risk of damage and shutdown, thus increasing the likelihood of power outages to our operations. Sections of tailings management infrastructure at PT-FI that are exposed to marine water levels already include adjustments for sea level rise in their designs. We perform periodic land elevation and tidal measurements to monitor sea level rise and plan to evaluate the structural resilience around the port and power plant. We will assess flood-related designs and review our recovery plans to account for the increased frequency of extreme sea level events that are projected in the next 30 years. We are preparing for exposure to the various physical risks identified through our analysis. To support water requirements for mining and processing and our local communities, Cerro Verde has made significant investments in local water infrastructure including construction of a wastewater treatment and collection facility which has improved the quality of the Chili River, benefitting more than 1 million people in Arequipa. Note: The values included in our findings are part of a range, and further study is needed for appropriate values to be accounted for in our operations and engineering designs, which we plan to do in the coming years.\n",
      "OPERATIONS, WORKFORCE, COMMUNITIES & SUPPLY CHAINS We also analyzed the current and potential future exposure of our operations, elements of our workforce and communities, and key vendor infrastructure and supply chains to a number of physical hazards. We identified certain critical vendors and assessed 224 vendor sites, 26 ports, five airports, two sea canals and railroads, gas pipelines, and electrical transmission lines in North America, Chile and Peru, and analyzed their exposure to current and potential future climate hazards under the same scenarios analyzed in this report. The following table provides an overview of the main potential impacts identified throughout the course of the scenario analysis that could affect our operations, workforce and our surrounding host communities. POTENTIAL PHYSICAL RISK IMPACTS PHYSICAL RISKS OPERATIONAL IMPACTS WORKFORCE & COMMUNITY IMPACTS LOGISTICS & SUPPLY CHAIN IMPACTS Extreme Precipitation • Production curtailment or increased costs from damage to, or inaccessibility to, operational and reclaimed facilities • Compliance risks from increased soil erosion and off-site releases • Health and safety risks and property or infrastructure damage • Supply disruption from supplier property damage, flooding of critical infrastructure • Increased trucking costs due to increased demand for trucks for disaster relief and reconstruction Extreme Heat • Increased cooling cost, overheating of processing equipment, and increased energy prices or potential power curtailment • Decreased productivity and increased health and safety risks • Exacerbated social unrest in regions with poor local governance or social support systems • Increased energy / cooling costs at supplier sites Water Stress • Production curtailment from limits on water allowances and availability • Increased power prices or outage from hydropower plants water shortage • Increased competition, pressure on local resources, and food and water insecurity in regions where Freeport operates • Community displacement / migration • Limits to water allowances and availability for suppliers Extreme Cold • Disruption to energy supply from freezing gas pipelines and increased heating demands • Increased natural gas and electricity prices • Increased heating demands and costs • Supply delays or increased prices of critical supplies from power outages at supplier locations and frozen roads and/or rail tracks Wildfire • Production disruption and reduced access • Evacuations, injuries, fatalities and respiratory diseases due to poor air quality • Supply delays from property damage, power outage or limited site access at supplier locations and logistics networks Sea Level Rise • Disrupted operations at our coastal sites, e.g., PT-FI and Atlantic Copper • Health and safety risks and community displacement • Supply delays from flooding of ports, airports or railroads and roads\n",
      "Supporting Community Resilience The physical effects of climate change are expected to have social, economic, political and security implications that would likely be most accentuated under the Current State (4°C) scenario, where physical risks are projected to be most significant. Aiding communities in adapting involves supporting their efforts in building their climate resilience and increasing their ability to withstand events such as droughts and floods. A summary of recent initiatives is provided below. For more information on community engagement programs, please see our 2020 Annual Report on Sustainability. Emergency Response, Relief & Prevention • Near our Miami operations, the Telegraph Fire in June and July of 2021 burned more than 180,000 acres. When heavy rain followed, the area experienced significant flooding, causing the evacuation of more than 100 families and damage to homes and infrastructure. Freeport provided heavy equipment and volunteer operators to assist with fighting the fire, saving structures, and aid in the clean-up and support families in addressing impacts to their properties to enable them to return home. The company also provided support to an emergency relief fund to aid families in addressing their recovery needs. • An unprecedented rain event in 2019 at our El Abra operation in Chile caused a shutdown and significant flooding and damage to the nearby indigenous community of Conchi Viejo. After supporting the immediate emergency needs of the town, Freeport continued to work with the local community in 2020 and 2021 to develop and implement measures to provide protection in the event of future extreme weather events, including the construction of rock walls, catch berms and ponds to decrease the velocity of rainwater and protect houses and other structures, including the local church. In addition, repairs and weatherproofing improvements were made to all 30 homes in the area. Managing Water Resources • At our Cerro Verde operations in Peru, where agriculture is very important to the local economy, we have long-supported local farmers with efficient irrigation systems as an adaptation measure for reduced water availability. Cerro Verde is coordinating with INDECI, the National Institute of Civil Defense and municipal leadership to develop a response and recovery plan for the future to enhance resilience. • At our Morenci operations, a partnership with the Town of Duncan and Midstate Energy was recently created to upgrade aging water, wastewater and energy infrastructure to prevent failures, reduce operating costs, and boost reliability and resiliency of the water system. A key component of the project is replacing the power supply for the wastewater treatment plant and primary municipal well with solar power systems to help reduce energy costs and consumption in the future. Disease Prevention • PT-FI works closely with the local Mimika government to support the provision of health services in the region through capacity building, construction of clinics, and malaria control programs. Since 2013, PT-FI and the Amungme Kamoro Community Development Foundation, in partnership with the local government, jointly have operated the Mimika Malaria Center and its Timika Malaria Control Program which coordinates all malaria prevention activities, such as indoor residual spraying of insecticides in homes and bed net distribution among the PT-FI workforce, their families and local communities. The activities have resulted in reduced malaria incidence through significant expansion of coverage, improved coordination, surveillance and reporting of malaria data. 2020 CLIMATE REPORT / 38 El Abra workforce members hold a ceremony with an indigenous community to thank Mother Earth in Chile.\n",
      "Copper rod manufactured at our Miami operations is prepared for shipment. We supply more than 40% of the copper consumed in the U.S. Our principal product – copper – is critical to the technologies necessary to enable the low-carbon energy transition.\n",
      "2020 CLIMATE REPORT / 40 Contribution The downstream use of copper is a critical enabler for the technologies that will support the future energy transition, from electrifying vehicles to solar and wind energy. With an estimated 7% net equity share of total worldwide mined copper production, Freeport’s role in supplying responsibly produced copper to support global decarbonization is crucial and we are committed to doing our part, both within our own operational boundaries and beyond. Freeport is uniquely positioned due to our vertical integration of both copper and molybdenum production, enabling us to directly manage and work towards mitigating the emissions associated with our products that would for many producers be downstream in their value chain. We also seek to collaborate with our industry, customers and other stakeholders to drive change, whether in responsible production certifications, developing carbon footprint models or advancing policy on climate. In 2020, ICA launched the Copper Mark – a continual improvement responsible production framework. This voluntary framework requires that copper producers undertake third-party assessments of their performance on 32 requirements across ESG issues. The current Copper Mark framework is focused on copper producers at the beginning of the supply chain, but the organization is developing criteria for fabricators and component producers with the goal of establishing a chain of custody for downstream companies, such as automobile and electronics producers. Freeport seeks to play a leading role in this work by actively participating in the organization's multi-stakeholder processes to further develop and work towards achieving its long-term strategy, referred to as Theory of Change. This includes key roles in the Advisory Council, Due Diligence Working Group, Technical Working Group and Transparency Working Group. As an early adopter of the Copper Mark assurance framework, we are committed to responsible production practices across our global operations. We plan to achieve the Copper Mark at all of our copper operating sites. In 2020, we began this process with a Letter of Commitment for our first six sites. Since then, all six sites have been awarded the Copper Mark and we have been carrying out our routine check-ins with the organization on improvement plans. In June 2021, FCX commenced the Copper Mark assessment process at five additional operating sites.

      "Copper’s Role in the Energy Transition Copper is expected to play an essential role in facilitating a future low-carbon transition. Copper is a key component in the technologies that will be deployed in a highly electrified and low- carbon economy, including solar and wind energy, electric vehicles (EVs), and other energy efficient technologies. Copper’s durability, reliability, superior conductivity and recyclability are some of the unique properties that can benefit batteries, wiring, electrical equipment and supporting infrastructure – such as transformers, generators, inverters and cooling systems. Because of these unique properties, copper is a necessary material for clean energy generation, transmission and storage. Renewable energy generation technologies rely more on copper than higher carbon alternatives, using four to five times more copper than fossil fuel power generation. In 2020, renewable energy resources generated a record-breaking 834 billion kWh of electricity – 21% of all electricity generated in the U.S. – and the U.S. Energy Information Administration expects growth to continue in coming years.1 CRU projects that global copper consumption from renewables will increase from 700 thousand metric tons per year in 2020 to 1.8 metric megatons per year in 2030.2 EVs, which require up to four times the amount of copper in terms of weight compared to vehicles of similar sizes with internal combustion engines, also are expected to be a long-term driver of demand for copper globally. Wood Mackenzie noted that by 2030, the world could have over 20 million EV charging points, consuming 205% more copper than in 2019, and by 2040, 38% of global vehicle sales are estimated to be EVs or hybrids.3 Collectively, these drivers of growth in applications of copper provide a very favorable outlook for copper. With its very long life cycle, copper is a truly circular material that is not only a good investment but also can be recycled over and over with no loss of its physical properties. ICA estimates that since 1900, two-thirds of the 550 million metric tons of copper mined is still in productive use. On average, copper products contain 35% recycled content, which significantly reduces copper’s carbon footprint. Because copper does not lose its intrinsic properties during recycling, it can be used again and again with the same expectations of performance. Nine million metric tons of copper are recycled every year. Copper recycling requires up to 85% less energy than primary production.

      "2020 CLIMATE REPORT / 42 Vertical Integration & Decarbonization Freeport’s vertically integrated copper portfolio (from earth to cathode) in the Americas and Europe enables us to directly manage and mitigate emissions that would typically be Scope 3 downstream processing emissions for other producers. Approximately 50% of Freeport’s overall copper concentrate production is vertically integrated, with our Miami smelter in Arizona and our Atlantic Copper smelter in Huelva, Spain, collectively processing approximately 1.4 million metric tons of internally produced concentrate per year. Additionally, our Atlantic Copper smelter purchases and processes approximately 70% of concentrate annually from other sources. Our refineries in El Paso, Texas, and Huelva, Spain, operate to upgrade copper anode to 99.99% copper cathode. In Miami, Arizona, and El Paso, Texas, our rod plants manufacture copper rod products for electrical markets. In fact, our own rod mills process 65% of our internal cathode production, which enables us to provide our customers with a secure and efficient supply of rod while managing and reducing our GHG emissions from earth to rod. Our vertically integrated position is expected to increase beyond the Americas and Europe to our operations in Indonesia. In 2021, our PT-FI operations set forth plans to expand the annual capacity at PTS (PT-FI's 39.5% owned copper smelter and refinery in Gresik, Indonesia) by 300 thousand metric tons of concentrate, a 30% increase from current levels. Additionally, PT-FI started construction of a new greenfield copper smelter in Gresik, Indonesia, with the capacity to process approximately 1.7 million metric tons of copper concentrate annually. From a GHG emissions perspective, this will shift what are now Scope 3 Category 10 downstream processing emissions into our Scope 1 and 2 total GHG emissions and enable us to maintain control all the way to cathode production to support further decarbonization. Our vertical integration from earth to rod in the U.S. market enables us to better control emissions related to our value chain. Pictured here are our Miami operations in Arizona.\n",
      "Collaborating to Advance Responsibly Produced Copper ENGAGING WITH INDUSTRY & BUSINESS ASSOCIATIONS In addition to our commitment to the Copper Mark, Freeport is a member of numerous industry associations, and we are involved in various organizations that provide a platform for advancing sustainability. We recognize the importance of collaboration with other thought-leaders to help drive change and progress, and we believe regular engagement with stakeholders is fundamental to our success. Through this work, we are able to listen to the views of a multitude of stakeholders, while also forming industry agreements and positions on our responsibilities across ESG issues and throughout our value chains. We also believe that industry associations are an important vehicle for collaboration and advancement of the contribution that our products make to the energy transition. Through our involvement in these associations we seek to share and drive best practices, develop new methodologies, invest in research on critical topics related to material stewardship, and support the development of effective policy. As we move forward, we endeavor to undertake a global evaluation of our memberships in various industry and business associations and whether the goals and objectives of those associations align with our commitments and aspirations. As part of this evaluation, we will consider the associations' positions on climate and broader sustainability objectives. As demonstrated by our leadership positions and active involvement with many associations, Freeport is committed to engaging the leadership and membership of these associations in an effort to align with best practices, which we believe should include constructively advancing the mining industry’s work on climate-related matters as well as advancing the goals of the Paris Agreement.

      "2020 CLIMATE REPORT / 44 COPPER’S CARBON FOOTPRINT Life Cycle Assessments (LCAs) provide an overview of environmental impacts across a product’s life cycle to enable decision makers to identify improvement opportunities and trade-offs. Globally, governments are using LCAs in circular economy policy setting more often to compare the carbon and water footprints of products and services. In early 2020, the ICA launched a project to update the current global LCA profile for copper concentrate and cathode. Freeport assists in this study by providing data from our mining and refining facilities. The project was temporarily suspended in 2020 to enable producers to focus on COVID-19 management. The project relaunched in early 2021 and has expanded its focus to include developing a methodology for the carbon footprint of copper. In addition, a project was re-initiated by the Copper Development Association, a partner organization to ICA in North America, to conduct a LCA of copper rod used for electrical applications. Freeport is participating in both studies, and we will seek to use the results of these studies to drive our internal improvements (e.g., support climate strategy) and to provide data to customers and other value-chain participants. We are participating in the ICA Global Copper Decarbonization Roadmap project with peers and partner organizations (such as the Copper Mark) to develop a footprint methodology for copper that can be used to set a baseline for decarbonization from earth to semi-fabricated copper. Workforce at our Safford operation in Arizona celebrate a production milestone - 2 billion pounds of copper produced since commencing operations in 2007.\n",

      "2020 CLIMATE REPORT / 46 Looking Ahead Copper is expected to play an essential role in renewable energy technologies necessary to enable a global energy transition. Freeport believes that copper should be produced responsibly, which includes operating in a way that manages and mitigates our own GHG emissions and other climate-related risks. Developing, implementing and executing on our climate strategy underpins our objective to provide responsibly produced copper to markets globally. We believe that our commitment to reduce our GHG emissions, enhance our climate-related resilience and contribute positively across our value chain is critical to the long-term sustainability of our business, including value creation for our stakeholders. Looking ahead, we aim to progress key actions across the three pillars of our strategy – reduction, resilience and contribution – and we plan to continue to voluntarily report on our successes, progress and challenges in alignment with the recommendations of the TCFD. REDUCTION In order to provide responsibly produced copper to global markets, we believe that we must reduce, manage and mitigate our own GHG emissions. Developing and implementing meaningful GHG emissions reduction targets supports our decarbonization strategy. In the near-term, we endeavor to develop two additional 2030 GHG emissions reduction targets (one for our primary molybdenum sites and one for Atlantic Copper) so that our full business has relevant 2030 GHG reduction targets. As a next step, we plan to third-party validate our 2030 GHG reduction targets with SBTi to determine if our targets align with their science-based criteria for targets in line with the Paris Agreement’s goals. We know, however, that reduction targets are only as meaningful as the progress we make towards achieving them. We aim to continue our efforts to develop and refine our decarbonization pathway across each of our current initiatives: (1) decarbonizing our electricity supply, (2) optimizing energy and asset efficiency, (3) electrification of equipment, and (4) process innovation. Specifically, over the next twelve months, we aim to advance our work with our Copper Skies evaluation and implementation to decarbonize our electricity supply in the Americas. At PT-FI, we are committed to advancing our evaluation for potential future use of LNG as well as other energy efficiency initiatives and electrification opportunities. We will continue our collaboration with our key suppliers and cross-industry consortiums in an effort to find a commercially viable solution to diesel haul trucks. This includes conducting on-the-ground trials of 400-ton class diesel-electric haul trucks in 2022. We also intend to develop abatement curves for our operations to help inform and prioritize our decarbonization efforts in support of our 2030 GHG reduction targets.\n",
      "2020 Decarbonization Pathways › Decarbonizing Electrical Supply › Equipment Electrification › Energy & Asset Efficiency › Process Innovation 2050 2030 RESILIENCE Following the completion of our first global climate scenario analysis in 2021, we plan to further evaluate the key findings related to the five primary risks and opportunities identified in our analysis: regulatory, market, technology and physical risks, and market opportunities. We will work with the relevant sites to educate and integrate the findings from our analysis, which we expect will include integrating relevant risks into our site-level sustainability risk registers and action planning processes. We will also continue working closely with host communities to help support and enhance their resilience to potential physical risks related to climate change. In preparation of our business for future climate scenarios, we will also continue our efforts to integrate our new carbon pricing into our decision-making processes. CONTRIBUTION In addition to the importance of copper to global decarbonization, we strive to produce and deliver our products responsibly while working to encourage circular economy frameworks including the reuse and recycling of copper. Over the course of 2022, we plan to continue our work with ICA to develop a global copper decarbonization roadmap and an associated carbon footprint methodology, which is critical to enabling the copper industry with consistent evaluation of carbon intensity at a product level. We are seeking to achieve the Copper Mark at five more of our sites where we have signed a letter of commitment. We plan to continue our work with the Copper Mark to help develop a standard for chain of custody that may be used for transfer of product level claims through the value chain in the future. ASPIRING TOWARDS NET ZERO Freeport aspires to participate in – and positively contribute to – a 2050 net zero economy. While we fully expect that our climate strategy will need to evolve and adapt over time as new technologies and information become available, we believe our current strategy and the decarbonization pathways we have identified are foundational to the work that needs to occur to achieve our 2030 GHG emissions intensity reduction targets and accomplish further reductions in future years. Our team is committed to developing a more robust understanding of how we can move beyond our aspirational vision to a science-based net zero pathway in future years, and we plan to continue to provide updates on our challenges, opportunities, progress and lessons learned. ILLUSTRATIVE 2050 NET ZERO PATHWAY1 2030 Targets2 (Scope 1 & 2) › Americas Copper 15% GHG emissions intensity reduction target › PT-FI 30% GHG emissions intensity reduction target ASPIRING TOWARDS NET ZERO IN 2050 (Scope 1 & 2) 1 This is a high-level, initial illustrative net zero pathway only. As we develop our understanding and make plans for our 2050 net zero aspiration, we anticipate that we will need to balance residual GHG emissions with offsets and removals and plan to explore a variety of opportunities to achieve our net zero aspiration. 2 FCX is committed to developing additional 2030 GHG emissions intensity reduction targets for our Climax molybdenum mines and downstream processing and for our Atlantic Copper smelter and refinery in Spain in the near-term.\n",
      "TPI Assessment of Below 2°C Scenario Launched in 2017, the Transitions Pathway Initiative (TPI) is a global asset owner-led initiative that aims to assess companies’ preparedness for the transition to a low-carbon economy. As of July 2021, 107 investors globally, representing over $29 trillion in assets under management, have pledged support of TPI’s efforts to objectively assess corporate performance on climate. In partnership with the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment at the London School of Economics and Political Science, Principles for Responsible Investment, and FTSE Russell, TPI developed its assessment framework, which seeks to measure two dimensions of a company’s climate performance based on publicly available information and in line with the recommendations of the TCFD: 1. Management Quality: the quality of companies’ management of their GHG emissions and risks and opportunities related to the low-carbon transition; and 2. Carbon Performance: how companies’ carbon performance now and in the future might compare to the international targets and national pledges made as part of the Paris Agreement. MANAGEMENT QUALITY Companies’ management quality is assessed against a series of indicators, covering issues such as company policy, GHG emissions reporting and verification, GHG emissions reduction targets, strategic risk assessment, and executive remuneration. As of their most recent assessment of management quality in October 2019, TPI rated Freeport as Level 2 or “building capacity” on a scale of Level 0 (unaware of climate change as a business issue) to Level 4 (strategic assessment). The most recent management quality assessment was conducted in 2019 prior to the publication of our inaugural climate report in June 2020. Since the 2019 assessment, we have continued to advance our work on climate-related issues and disclosed more robust information on our climate strategy, management of climate-related issues and opportunities, and progress on climate initiatives. We anticipate this information will be incorporated and considered by TPI in their next management quality assessment. CARBON PERFORMANCE Companies’ carbon performance is assessed using the Sectoral Decarbonization Approach (SDA), which was developed by CDP, the World Wildlife Fund, and the World Resources Institute in 2015. The SDA utilizes modeling conducted by the IEA to translate absolute GHG emissions reduction targets made at the international level through the Paris Agreement into sector-based “carbon budgets,” or benchmarks. Within each sector, TPI measures carbon performance based on emissions intensity in order to normalize each company’s emissions per unit of activity. This approach allows for comparison of the performance of individual companies in specific sectors. TPI assessed the largest publicly traded, diversified mining companies, based on market capitalization, against three benchmarks for the sector: (1) Paris- aligned, (2) 2°C scenario, and (3) below 2°C scenario. Their assessment includes companies’ Scope 1 and 2 emissions as well as select Scope 3 emissions from the processing of sold products (GHG Protocol Category 10) and the use of sold products (GHG Protocol Category 11). TPI notes that Scope 3 emissions intensities vary substantially between commodities, which in turn, can generate significant differences in starting points for companies’ emissions intensity depending on the commodities produced. In order to be in line with TPI’s below 2°C scenario for the diversified mining sector, companies must produce less than approximately 20 metric tons of CO2 equivalent per metric ton of copper equivalent produced. The most recent TPI assessment of carbon performance in December 2020 concluded that Freeport already is aligned with TPI’s below 2°C scenario in 2050 at approximately 7 metric tons CO2 equivalent per ton of copper produced. This is partly due to the fact that the primary product we produce – copper – requires less energy per ton to concentrate and partly because refining copper produces fewer downstream Scope 3 emissions compared to competing or other mined materials. Freeport has been engaging with TPI on their assessment and methodology and aims to continue to do so as our own data and assessment methodology improves. 2020 CLIMATE REPORT / 48\n",
      "About this Report Freeport aims to communicate regularly and transparently about the risks and opportunities climate change poses to our operational and financial performance. Our 2020 Climate Report provides information on how we approach climate change and is intended to be a companion to our 2020 Annual Report on Sustainability as well as the sustainability section of our website. This report focuses primarily on the most significant entities that FCX consolidates, including its 48.76 percent-owned subsidiary PT Freeport Indonesia, and the following wholly-owned subsidiaries: Freeport Minerals Corporation and Atlantic Copper, S.L.U. (Atlantic Copper), for the period January 1, 2020 to December 31, 2020, unless otherwise indicated. Data is as of December 31, 2020, unless otherwise noted.

      "2020 CLIMATE REPORT / 50 EXTERNAL ASSURANCE Freeport retained GHD Limited (GHD) to conduct a risk-based verification of the 2020 GHG emissions inventory for Freeport’s global operations. GHD’s verification included Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions from Freeport’s global operations from January 1, 2020 to December 31, 2020 in accordance with ISO 14064 (Specifications 1 and 3) to a reasonable level of assurance. Due to travel restrictions in place due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, GHD completed all verification activities virtually. A copy of GHD’s verification statement is included in this report and available in the sustainability section of our website. Restatements and Quality Improvements Prior to 2018, we relied on the United States Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) eGRID published data for emissions factors when calculating Scope 2 emissions for purchased electricity, as is common practice for U.S.- based companies. In 2018, we transitioned to a more accurate, market-based approach to calculate the emissions from our PPA-contracted resources and our wholesale and retail utilities providers. The emissions factors calculated under the market-based approach better reflect our actual GHG emissions intensity, enabling us to more accurately demonstrate our decarbonization efforts. In 2021, we expanded our Scope 3 emissions calculations to include additional categories in line with the GHG Protocol. As a result, our 2020 Scope 3 emissions figures here are higher than the Scope 3 emissions reported in our 2020 Annual Report on Sustainability, with the figures in this report being the most current. The Scope 3 emissions now include all emissions sources for which data is available and may be further expanded in the future. GHD determined that the changes in emissions from the previous reporting period are consistent with changes in operations and calculation methodologies.

The calculations have been restated accordingly back to 2016. 5 In 2021, we expanded our Scope 3 emissions calculations to include additional categories in line with the WRI/WBCSD GHG Protocol. As a result, our 2020 Scope 3 emissions figures here are higher than the Scope 3 emissions reported in our 2020 Annual Report on Sustainability, with the figures in this report being the most current.

Baseline and target are calculated (total emissions / payable copper) and therefore may differ due to rounding error. 2 Freeport Americas Copper (for target) includes Bagdad, Cerro Verde, Chino (including Cobre), El Abra, Morenci, Safford (including Lone Star), Sierrita and Tyrone mines as well as downstream processing at the Miami Smelter and El Paso Refinery. The Freeport Americas Copper intensity target includes all payable copper forms up to cathode (which includes concentrate, anode, and cathode) but excludes rod and wire. 3 Our PT-FI intensity reduction target is based on payable copper produced in concentrate. PT-FI concentrate is currently smelted and refined by PTS and third-party smelters / refineries, which are currently accounted for in our Scope 3 emissions estimates (not included in the target). Upon completion of the PTS expansion for which PT-FI will have majority ownership and the construction of the new greenfield smelter at Gresik, GHG emissions for smelting and refining are expected to shift from Scope 3 to Scopes 1 or 2, and we will adjust our target and baseline in line with the GHG Protocol at such time.\n",

      "LEON J. TOPALIAN LETTER FROM THE CEO Dear fellow stockholders, To be successful, Nucor must be able to meet its customers’ needs for high-quality steel products consistently, safely and efficiently. And increasingly our customers want these products to be made with less emissions as they look to reduce the environmental impact of their supply chains. As one of the cleanest steelmakers in the world, Nucor is well positioned to be the supplier of choice for governments, institutions and companies in markets like construction, renewable energy and automotive that are all working towards their own GHG reduction targets. We took several steps this year to build on our industry-leading environmental performance: • We announced a commitment to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions intensity by an additional 35%, from a 2015 baseline, by 2030, which will bring us 77% below the global average. • We launched Econiq™, the steel industry’s first line of net-zero GHG emissions steel products at scale, and sent our first shipment of Econiq steel to General Motors, which will help the automotive manufacturing company decarbonize its supply chain. • We also launched Aeos™, a high-strength, weldable structural steel that is produced almost entirely from recycled scrap. The green economy is being built on steel. And the steel it is built from matters. With Congress passing a significant infrastructure spending bill, clean American-made steel will be needed to modernize our roads, bridges, energy systems, railroads, waterways and ports in a sustainable way. Nucor stands at the ready to be the provider of that steel. We won’t be sustainable if we don’t operate safely. I am happy to report that we are making good progress toward achieving our goal of becoming the World’s Safest Steel Company. In fact, 2021 was our best year ever for safety, improving on the record progress we made in both 2019 and 2020. Sixteen Nucor divisions had zero recordable injuries in 2021. I applaud each of my Nucor teammates for their daily commitment to safety and caring for one another. Our accomplishments in the areas of sustainability and safety came during a year in which the Nucor Team produced record earnings, record revenue and record shipments, which shows that sustainability and profitability goals are quite compatible. We also completed capital investment projects and announced new ones that will add to our portfolio of clean steel products produced with lower emissions. In this report, you will learn more about these initiatives, as well as the other ways the Nucor team is improving our safety and environmental performance. I am incredibly proud of the work my 30,000 teammates are doing each day and to share our ESG progress with you. Sincerely, Leon J. Topalian President & Chief Executive Officer 02\n",

      "Nucor’s raw materials segment provides scrap and direct reduced iron (DRI), both of which feed our steel mills, and acquires additional metallic inputs from the marketplace, as needed. Utilizing EAFs, our steel mills produce a wide range of primary steel shapes for sale to outside customers as well as to our downstream steel products companies. Approximately 20% of our steel mill production is converted into a wide range of items by Nucor’s steel products group, including steel tubing, electrical conduit, joists and joist girders, steel deck, steel fasteners, fabricated rebar, steel grating, metal buildings, insulated metal panels, racking systems, wire and wire mesh, piling and foundation products. This integration, from raw material through final product, allows Nucor to operate more sustainably and provide the supply chain transparency that our customers are increasingly interested in, enhancing our position as a supplier of choice in our industry. From electric vehicles (EVs) to offshore wind towers to modern high-rise construction, steel is a ubiquitous component of the U.S. green economy. Its flexibility, strength, aesthetics and relatively low cost have made steel the choice of architects, engineers, manufacturers and consumers for more than a century. The markets and customers that Nucor serves are becoming increasingly aware and concerned about the environmental and social impact of their supply chains. And Nucor’s EAF-based steelmaking facilities generate the lowest GHG equivalent emissions per ton in the steel industry. A large percentage of the steel Nucor produces eventually makes it into a wide range of construction applications. From nuts and bolts to the beams underpinning the nation’s tallest skyscrapers, Nucor steel can be found on almost every construction site in America. Construction of warehouses for goods distribution and data centers have been among the fastest growing markets for our products in recent years and continue to be an important construction market sub-segment for Nucor. In 2021 Nucor acquired Hannibal Industries, Inc., a leading national provider of steel racking solutions, and the insulated metal panels (IMP) brands Centria and Metl-Span. Adding steel racking and IMP solutions to our product portfolio expands Nucor’s abilities to serve our customers in the fast-growing warehouse and distribution market. WHO WE ARE AND HOW WE CREATE VALUE 04 Nucor entered the steelmaking business in 1969, providing steel products to our fledgling steel joist business in South Carolina. Utilizing a revolutionary steelmaking technology, the Electric Arc Furnace, or EAF, to melt scrap into new steel with electricity, Nucor grew to supply its own steel products divisions. Recycling scrap steel in EAFs gave Nucor an advantage over traditional steel mills, which used giant blast furnaces to make steel from raw ore. That advantage continues in today’s Nucor, the largest steel producer in North America. Our business is organized into three segments: raw materials, steel mills and steel products.\n",
      "Other critical end-use markets include automotive, energy, machinery, heavy and agricultural equipment, transportation and appliances. Although each of these industries utilize a different mix of steel products, grades and sizes, they all require a steel producer that understands and anticipates the changing demands of the market. Renewable energy is a significant growth opportunity that has drawn our focus. To achieve the United States’ renewable energy goals, a massive amount of steel will be needed to build wind and solar power generation assets, as well as enhanced energy transmission infrastructure. Nucor is investing today in capabilities that will enhance its position tomorrow as a leader in sustainably producing the steel required for this renewable energy future. Nucor is not only providing steel to build out our nation’s renewable energy infrastructure, but the company is also investing in the development of solar and wind energy projects. We continue to invest in new products and new capabilities, so that we can build on our industry leadership position by more sustainably meeting both current and emerging market needs. Throughout Nucor’s history, we have served as a strategic partner for our customers; applying the latest innovations, staying abreast of design trends, and using market analytics to develop products that help solve their most pressing challenges. We regularly bring customers new opportunities to drive progress and growth together. Over the last four years, Nucor has invested over $6 billion, expanding our product portfolio to include more value- added steel mill products and capabilities. These investments have both expanded Nucor’s product and solutions to steel-consuming markets, as well as enhanced the sustainability and efficiency of our steel mills. Over the decades, our consistent focus on diversifying our product offering and lowering costs has enabled us to deliver profitable growth and create value for our stakeholders. As we gained market share, we made it a priority to help lower the overall environmental footprint of the domestic steel industry in the United States, protect our teammates and support our communities. Fundamental to our success has been Nucor’s commitment to remaining the employer of choice for our team of 30,000 men and women. Their dedication has forged Nucor into America’s most diversified steel and steel products company, and North America’s largest recycler. WHO WE ARE AND HOW WE CREATE VALUE 05 END-USE MARKETS SERVED Based on Nucor internal data and estimates for Nucor shipments through service centers. Approximately 30% of Nucor steel by volume was sold to service centers in 2021.

      "GROWING RESPONSIBLY IN THE AUTOMOBILE MARKET Nucor’s commitment and support to the automotive industry continued in 2021. The impacts of COVID, as well as significant supply-chain disruptions, made for a challenging year for automobile manufacturers. Nevertheless, Nucor, for the 4th straight year, was recognized as a Supplier of the Year by General Motors (GM). A group of GM executives selected the winner based on criteria such as Global Purchasing and Manufacturing Services, as well as Customer Care and Aftersales. In addition, GM further recognized the contributions of Nucor in helping the automaker achieve critical sustainability goals through its exclusive Overdrive award. Nucor’s Econiq, a net-zero carbon steel product introduced in October 2021, was specifically identified in the award and will be incorporated by GM in the all-electric 2023 Cadillac Lyriq. Nucor received recognition from other large American manufacturers in 2021, winning the Caterpillar Platinum award as well as recognition from Ford with their Q1 Certification for quality. Suppliers are certified through a Supplier Quality Excellence Process (SQEP) by meeting or exceeding stringent supplier performance standards, such as product quality and shipping performance, which are measured over the course of a year by a cross-functional global team of Caterpillar experts in the areas of engineering, manufacturing, logistics and procurement. The Ford Q1 Certification is awarded to Ford suppliers who demonstrate excellence beyond the ISO/TS certification requirements in five critical areas: capable systems, continuous improvement, ongoing performance, superior manufacturing process and customer satisfaction. QUALITY RECOGNITION FOR ENGINEERED BAR WHO WE ARE AND HOW WE CREATE VALUE 06 Nucor received the GM Overdrive Award for our partnership with General Motors on Econiq™, the world's first line of net-zero carbon steel products at scale.

      "WHO WE ARE AND HOW WE CREATE VALUE 10 Our Brandenburg, Kentucky greenfield mill is on track to begin rolling its first steel plate product in the fourth quarter of 2022. With the capability to manufacture nearly all the sizes and grades consumed in the United States, Brandenburg will position Nucor as a supplier of choice in the domestic plate market which includes applications in offshore wind, heavy equipment, construction and military. And in late 2021 we announced plans to build a new rebar micro mill with annual capacity of 430,000 tons in the South Atlantic region. This will be Nucor’s third rebar micro mill joining micro mills in Missouri and Florida that began operations in 2020. EXPANDING IN THE PLATE AND BAR MARKETS As we move into 2022, we are not letting up when it comes to executing our strategy to grow our value-added product portfolio and expand into new product markets and geographic regions. We are building a new state-of-the-art sheet mill in Mason County, West Virginia. The location along the Ohio River provides Nucor with important transportation and logistics advantages in serving the country’s two largest sheet steel-consuming regions, the Midwest and Northeast. Our West Virginia mill will have some of the most advanced capabilities and one of the lowest carbon footprints of any sheet mill in the world. Our Nucor Steel Arkansas sheet mill produced the first prime coil from its third generation flexible galvanizing line at the end of the year. The new galvanizing line, combined with Nucor Arkansas’s highly successful specialty cold rolling mill that’s been in operation for more than two years, uniquely positions our company among North American EAF steelmakers to provide the high-strength, lightweight steels that are increasingly in demand. Another sheet mill project, Nucor Steel Gallatin’s hot band modernization and expansion, will start up in early 2022. This project provides thicker slab casting and wider coil capabilities, expanding our product portfolio into markets currently served by higher cost competitors. We are also expanding our presence in the Western U.S. with the acquisition of a majority ownership stake of 51% in California Steel Industries. CSI is a flat-rolled converter with annual capacity to produce more than 2 million tons of finished steel and steel products. EXPANDING INTO NEW PRODUCT MARKETS AND GEOGRAPHIC REGIONS\n",
      "WHO WE ARE AND HOW WE CREATE VALUE 11 No North American producer is better positioned than Nucor to continue leading in these areas. We’re very proud that Nucor has helped make the United States the cleanest place in the world to make steel. The green economy is being built on steel, and the steel it’s built on matters.

      "WHO WE ARE AND HOW WE CREATE VALUE 12 From the time we entered the steel business more than 50 years ago, Nucor has been laser-focused on making sustainable steel. When our first EAF roared into life in Darlington, South Carolina, it ushered in a new era of steelmaking in the U.S. and radically transformed the industry. The impact is still felt today with more than 70% of U.S. steel production coming from EAFs, making the U.S. one of the cleanest places in the world to make steel. Throughout our over 50 years of making steel, Nucor has pushed its sustainability efforts even further by looking to close the recycling loop through the efforts of Nucor Industrial Recycling. The goal of Nucor Industrial Recycling is to work with current and potential steel customers to find new and better ways to return steel scrap directly from manufacturing facilities to steel mills for remelting. A.O. Smith Water Products Company is a prime example of the circular steel economy in action. A.O. Smith is headquartered in Ashland City, Tennessee where they operate the world’s largest water heater manufacturing plant. They purchase 100% of the steel they use from Nucor. Nucor Industrial Recycling worked with A.O. Smith to identify opportunities to improve their scrap process. We installed chute systems along with scales on-site to maximize the payload of each truck leaving their facility. Through Nucor Industrial Recycling’s consultative approach to scrap programs, we increased truck payloads by 40%, which decreased the number of trucks that were coming and going from the facility. This has drastically reduced Scope 3 emissions while capturing over 1,000 tons of scrap per month. Steel scrap produced from A.O. Smith’s manufacturing process now goes directly back to Nucor Steel Decatur to be remelted into new steel products. Through continued collaboration with the Nucor Sales team and mill operations, Nucor Industrial Recycling is confident that A.O. Smith’s circular steel experience can be replicated with other customers, saving the environment one ton of steel at a time.

      "GOVERNANCE 16 The Board of Directors establishes guidelines to assess and manage risks faced by Nucor. In addition to Board oversight, our CEO and our entire executive team are fully engaged in risk management and mitigation. A comprehensive annual report on the risks facing Nucor is prepared by our Corporate Controller, Director of Internal Audit and General Counsel and submitted to the Audit Committee for review. The Audit Committee then meets with our managers and provides its recommendations on how Nucor should prioritize and manage the risk factors under consideration. The risks identified include those related to climate change such as extreme weather events, disruptions to our supply chain and impacts to our markets. Some of Nucor’s other ongoing risks include those related to economic conditions, legal or environmental liabilities, and cybersecurity. Specifically: • Demand for steel products can be cyclical, causing significant fluctuations in prices and shipment volumes of our products. • Nucor is also affected by fluctuations in the costs of energy and raw materials on an ongoing basis. • Complying with environmental, safety and other regulations typically requires us to incur expenses that reduce our profits and cash flows, but also helps us manage risks in these areas. • Cybersecurity is an area of increasing concern for all companies. We have increased our investments in technology and personnel to address this growing risk area in recent years. APPROACH TO RISK ASSESSMENT Nucor has Standards of Business Conduct and Ethics that all officers and teammates are expected to follow. They cover issues including ethical business conduct, conflicts of interest, gifts and confidentiality. We also have a separate Code of Ethics for Senior Financial Professionals. Each senior financial officer, including our CEO, must sign this document by hand, and submit it to our corporate headquarters. These documents are available to view on our website here. ETHICS AND COMPLIANCE Our CEO and our entire executive team are fully engaged in Nucor’s progress toward achieving our sustainability goals and initiatives.

      "22 Nucor partners with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) through its Voluntary Protection Program (VPP), which recognizes companies that voluntarily exceed the safety standards required by law. Achieving VPP Status requires a rigorous safety and health management system. Among our divisions, 24 of them participate in the VPP, and all have achieved VPP Star status, the highest award possible in the program. To qualify, divisions must have injury and illness rates below the national average for their industries. Nucor also participates in the Special Government Employee Program, which allows our Nucor teammates to work alongside OSHA to perform on-site safety evaluations. Qualified volunteers from Nucor are eligible to participate in the SGE Program. These volunteers must be approved by OSHA, and their participation is funded by Nucor. Nucor has one of the largest numbers of SGE volunteers in the country. Though not life-threatening, hand injuries can be devastating, as they limit one’s ability to do basic things. Starting in 2021, we kicked off our first annual Hand Safety Week. An assessment of our safety records found that hand injuries account for nearly half the injuries we see across Nucor. To meet the challenge of becoming the World’s Safest Steel Company, we made the determination that we must drastically reduce hand injuries. While we have implemented specific training to recognize and make adjustments in situations where there is particular risk for hand injuries, it is our fellow Nucor teammates who are coming up with their own innovative solutions to this problem and sharing these strategies across our Nucor family. Our teammates have led the way in helping to determine which ideas can be widely applied to ensure hand safety across the company. These new practices and routines helped drive a 15% reduction in hand injuries over the course of 2021 - a trend that we look to continue into 2022.

      "We take teammate feedback seriously, both on an ongoing basis, and through an employee-wide survey administered every three years. Negative responses have dropped by 25% since our first survey in 1986. On our most recent survey in 2019, 90% of the comments under “Satisfaction and Commitment” were positive, with our commitment to safety getting the highest rating. Recently, we have added two more surveys to monitor the teammate experience at Nucor. Nucor participates in the Great Place to Work (GPTW) certification process, which surveys an anonymous random sample of 5,000 teammates and compares our results to those of the average company surveyed by GPTW, as well as other manufacturing companies. This survey resulted in Nucor becoming Great Place to Work certified, as well as being ranked #14 on Fortune’s Best Workplaces in Manufacturing and Production Nucor also conducts a teammate value proposition survey that is administered by Shaker Recruitment Marketing and was completed by almost 10,000 teammates. This survey asks teammates to rate the importance of different workplace and employer factors, and then rates how well Nucor performs for each factor. Notably, our employee survey results show that approximately 92% of our teammates feel a strong sense of belonging at Nucor, and 92% are proud to tell others that they work for Nucor. Furthermore, 90% of teammates feel fulfilled in their current job, and 91% of teammates are engaged. Additionally, since 1999 we have facilitated multiple, cross-divisional annual teammate forums to understand our progress on goals and the effectiveness of our inclusive and open-minded culture. 24 MONITORING AND MEASURING 92% OF OUR TEAMMATES ARE PROUD TO TELL OTHERS THAT THEY WORK FOR NUCOR SAFETY AND TEAMMATES\n",

Fortune is a well-respected source on corporate reputation, surveying 4,000 executives, directors, and securities analysts to compile its list of Most Admired Companies. Nucor received this valuable recognition in 2021 because of the hard work and dedication of our teammates. Competition between companies to attract and retain top talent was already intense before the COVID-19 pandemic and it is even more so now. Outside recognition like this from Fortune Magazine helps add to our ongoing efforts to recruit the best and the brightest to join our team. Fortune is merely recognizing what we already know to be true – the Nucor culture is admired because of our teammates. NUCOR IS ONE OF FORTUNE’S MOST ADMIRED COMPANIES SAFETY AND TEAMMATES\n",
      "26 Possibly now more than ever, Nucor’s unwavering commitment to its teammates resonates with today’s workforce. Perhaps our founder, Ken Iverson, said it best: “A teammate who does their job well today should feel confident they will have it tomorrow.” With not a single job lost due to the COVID epidemic, Nucor’s reputation as a reliable employer has become a more important consideration among job seekers, especially over the past year. Although, for Nucor, the value it represents is nothing new. Nucor will continue to grow without losing sight of the remarkable culture that has made it a great place to work – and build a career. COMMITMENT Our retention rate typically exceeds 92%. At Nucor, it starts with hiring standards, ensuring that only those considered to be excellent potential teammates are brought onboard. In turn, candidates are introduced to the teammates they will be working with; individuals who espouse strong ethics and integrity, people who value working together as a team, interacting face-to-face and doing what is right for the safety and well-being of everyone around them. It’s no surprise that “like a family” was consistently referenced when teammates were asked to describe the working culture at Nucor. And though other companies may say the same, at Nucor, there is no mistaking that our culture is indeed the “real deal.” Our teammates often form deep bonds with the time spent together, both inside and outside of work. Just one of the many reasons why Fortune Magazine named Nucor the top Workplace in Manufacturing and Production. The level of freedom Nucor affords its teammates is at the heart of our innovative culture. If a teammate has an idea that would make things more efficient, safer, or better, they are encouraged to develop it. Nucor doesn’t hire the best and brightest to bury them under forms and bureaucracy. Nucor wants to leverage what the best and brightest are typically known for: thinking outside the box and making things better. So, our teammates are given the go-ahead to execute on good ideas and are encouraged to get back on the horse if things don’t go as planned. Quite simply, Nucor believes that good teammates are going to want to do the right thing for themselves, their teams and their company, and leaves it to them to make it happen.

      "27 Investing in our core partner schools allows Nucor to develop the degrees that are needed to advance steelmaking technology, and to help young engineers find their passion in the metals industry. At Tuskegee University, Nucor has invested in the Nucor Education & Research Center of Excellence, also known as the Nucor Lab. There, engineering students receive hands-on experience studying real-world examples from our mills and solving real problems for Nucor customers. At the South Dakota School of Mines and Technology, Nucor has donated toward the construction of its new state-of-the-art Mineral Industries Building which, following its expected completion in early 2024, will house all disciplines related to steelmaking. Nucor was the first industry partner to contribute to the Missouri University of Science and Technology’s $300 million Arrival District Project, contributing $2.5 million in cash and in- kind donations. ENGAGING AND DEVELOPING OUR PEOPLE According to our “Teammate Value Proposition” survey, 90% of teammates feel fulfilled in their current job. Nucor maintains numerous internal programs and initiatives to help ensure the quality and equity of our teammate recruitment, retention and talent development systems. We also provide extensive “on-the-job” as well as external education training opportunities for teammates. Our reimbursement of educational expenses for teammates and their spouses has enabled many to pursue college degrees, helping them further advance their careers while they are employed at Nucor. We consistently seek feedback from our teammates about these programs to ensure that we continue to meet the growth and development needs of our Nucor family. We also provide extensive support to help our teammates further their childrens’ growth and development – providing $14,000 to each teammate’s child to use for educational expenses after high school graduation. Through the Nucor Foundation, we regularly fund over $6 million a year in these scholarship payments and have contributed over $115 million since the inception of the program.

We regularly review the demographics of leadership candidates and create appropriate talent acquisition and development plans to ensure we are building a world-class, diverse workforce. SUCCESSION PLANNING Nucor’s commitments to inclusion and diversity have been integral parts of Nucor’s culture of teamwork and trust since our start when Ken Iverson desegregated all aspects of our first steel products facility in Florence, South Carolina. And we have always understood that benefiting from diversity, equity and inclusion requires more than just reflecting demographics. We rely on our culture to guide us as we continuously look for ways to improve on our efforts to make every teammate feel they are part of the Nucor team. Our focus on safety and looking out for one another’s well-being has always defined the way we work with each other, our customers and our partners. As a leading steel company, we have a responsibility to create a culture where all our teammates feel they are a part of our organization. To do this, we need to know when and why people do not feel that they belong. Over the past few years, we have been listening, learning and having difficult conversations around race, gender and workplace equity issues with our teammates. We seek to better understand people’s perceptions about our workplace and the level of belonging our teammates feel. DIVERSITY, EQUITY AND INCLUSION We are optimistic that more open communication about differences and difficulties encountered will make us all more aware, supportive and empathetic, so that our culture continues to develop along a path of improving equity and inclusivity. We believe this kind of progress can help make Nucor even more diverse and high performing over time. 93% of teammates agree that people at Nucor are treated fairly regardless of their race or sexual orientation. To ensure that our workforce reflects the local demographics of each of our facilities’ locations, Nucor consults the U.S. Census Bureau for data on the percentage of racial and ethnic minorities in a given area and factors that data into our hiring practices for that region. Thus far, 94% of our job categories reflect the demographics of their local communities. Over the last three years, approximately 20% of our workforce identifies as a racial and/or ethnic minority. We have been holding focus groups for teammates that we believe have helped to promote open dialogue on making the workplace feel inclusive for all. And we have been incorporating the resulting feedback into our training on diversity issues. In addition, diverse senior leaders have been sharing their experiences with Nucor teammates via video interviews to reinforce our values and expectations with the purpose of creating a stronger sense of belonging for all our 30,000 teammates. 94% OF OUR JOB CATEGORIES REFLECT THE DEMOGRAPHICS OF THEIR LOCAL COMMUNITIES.

The Department of Energy awarded this project nearly $5 million as part of a broader effort to fund the research and development of innovative solutions to decarbonize the natural gas power and industrial sectors. COLLABORATING FOR ENVIRONMENTAL PERFORMANCE TRENDS IN OUR PERFORMANCE SELECTED ENERGY EFFICIENCY INITIATIVES Our sheet group rolling mills have decreased heat loss by ~95%, from more than 200,000 BTUs/hour to less than 10,000 BTUs/hour per roll. This dramatic improvement was accomplished by switching from hollow, watercooled rolls to dry rolls. Our new rebar mills in Sedalia, Missouri, and Frostproof, Florida, utilize continuous casters directly coupled with hot rolling of the billets, obviating the need for traditional reheat furnaces. This change in equipment has decreased gas usage by 75%. Nucor is exploring new technologies to produce better grades of scrap shred to remove more non-ferrous material and increase the value. For example, residual copper can create challenges since high-quality flat-rolled products require very low levels of copper to be present in order to avoid metallurgical problems. A well-formed layer of foamy slag on the steel melt’s surface prevents heat loss through the EAF walls, reducing the need for energy by 3%- 10%. The same layer can also raise the efficiency of an oxy-fuel burner between 40%- 70%, further reducing energy requirements. We are utilizing SmartARC software to enhance the performance of our EAFs by optimizing the use of electricity and gas to reduce our energy consumption and process emissions.\n",
      "ENVIRONMENTAL PERFORMANCE 37 Nucor has entered into three Virtual Power Purchase Agreements (VPPAs), which will help enable the construction of 600 megawatts (MW) of new clean power generation. We have invested in these projects to support the ongoing transition of the U.S. power grid toward greater reliance on renewable energy. As a result, Nucor is the largest buyer of renewable energy in the domestic steel industry. • Nucor announced its first VPPA with EDF Renewables in November 2020 that was scheduled to begin operations in mid-2023. This 250-megawatt solar facility, when completed, will supply the regional electrical grid for decades to come. • In March 2021, Nucor signed a VPPA to purchase 100 megawatts of energy from Ørsted's Western Trail wind farm (WTW) in North Texas. This 367-megawatt farm was operational as of August 2021 and incorporated Nucor steel in its construction. • A third VPPA for 250 megawatts of solar energy was executed with a leading U.S. based developer during 2021. Nucor will receive Renewable Energy Credits (“RECs”) from these projects commensurate with the power we purchase. These RECs can be applied against a portion of our GHG emissions, enabling us to receive credit for reducing them. One VPPA started delivering RECs to our company in July 2021 and the other two VPPAs may be delayed as a result of supply chain disruptions and permitting and interconnection delays. Once these three projects are complete, we expect to cover 10% of our current steel mill electricity with attributes from these VPPAs. We continue to explore the possibility of signing additional VPPAs with consideration to both their economics and their impact on the carbon emissions profile of the regional electricity grid. SUPPORTING NEW CLEAN POWER GENERATION Environmental Product Declarations (EPDs) are increasingly required in certain states and by many of our customers as they endeavor to improve the transparency of their supply chains. An EPD is an independently verified document that summarizes a product’s life cycle impacts and provides quantitative data regarding where in the product’s life cycle impacts are the greatest. EPDs are becoming more of a factor in sourcing decisions in the construction, automotive and renewable energy markets. Information from an EPD can also be used to obtain LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) certification from the U.S. Green Building Council. As EPDs become a more important part of product sourcing, companies involved in the recycling industry such as Nucor stand to benefit by being able to meet the demand for sustainable products. We are actively producing EPDs for products to comply with regulations and to remain a competitive partner. For more information, please click here. DOCUMENTING PRODUCT IMPACTS Nucor is proud to be a Charter Member of the World Steel Association Sustainability Charter. As one of the cleanest steelmakers in the world, we are committed to continuously making our operations safer and cleaner for our teammates and the communities we call home. We look forward to working with the global industry to ensure steel remains the foundation of a sustainable world.\n",
      "ENVIRONMENTAL PERFORMANCE 38 As the largest recycling company in North America, Nucor recognizes our role in protecting the environment. We value the environment of the communities in which we operate, and recognize its importance to our teammates, their families, and our continued welfare. Protecting the environment is critical to our operations and the company’s long-term success. To this end, we endorse the following principles: NUCOR CORPORATE ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY PERFORMANCE To continuously improve the effectiveness of our ISO 14001:2004 or ISO 14001:2015 Environmental Management System (EMS). Nucor will: • Pursue pollution prevention and waste minimization opportunities; • Investigate and develop technologies and operations that improve environmental performance; • Regularly evaluate the EMS and make appropriate improvements. STEWARDSHIP Nucor recognizes our potential for environmental impact on the communities in which we operate. We will continuously strive to minimize these effects by evaluating our operations and researching new technologies and opportunities. RESPONSIBILITY Environmental protection is the individual obligation of each Nucor teammate and a primary responsibility of management. Nucor requires our contractors, vendors, and suppliers to comply with applicable environmental laws. STANDARD Nucor and its divisions will comply with the laws and regulations governing our operations. Environmental compliance is a priority for Nucor management equal with all other business functions. OUTREACH Nucor will strive to foster open dialogue so that we may effectively communicate with our teammates, our neighbors, and other concerned parties.\n",
      "ENVIRONMENTAL PERFORMANCE 39 The Nucor Environmental University (NEU) is a virtual platform initiated in 2015 to train teammates on environmental compliance, and to connect teammates whose responsibilities include environmental performance. NEU begins with a “Welcome to Nucor” series, which seeks to provide a thorough understanding of Nucor’s approach to environmental management and compliance, along with the tools and resources we offer to help oversee it. This introductory series is followed by courses on laws such as the Clean Air Act, Clean Water Act, and Resource Conservation and Recovery Act. For teammates whose roles require more in-depth training, more advanced courses are available on subjects relevant to their areas of responsibility. Thus far, more than 1,000 teammates have completed almost 10,000 NEU courses, and passed more than 6,600 related exams. TRAINING TEAMMATES ON THE ENVIRONMENT To minimize our impact, we strive to use water as efficiently as possible. We have developed treatment systems to recycle 100% of our water multiple times — as many as 8-10 — before it needs to be discarded. We have also built stormwater retention ponds throughout our operations to collect stormwater runoff for our use. For example, in Louisville, Kentucky, Nucor Tubular Group’s utilization of the water from its retention ponds avoids the need to source more than 3.5 million gallons of water per month from the local municipal water supply. None of our EAF steel mills are located in areas deemed to be High or Extremely High Water Stress Areas. Water is a crucial resource that we rely on for cooling products and machinery. Nucor understands that the large amounts of water that we withdraw for our operations can adversely affect local ecosystems and communities and we are committed to taking all reasonable measures to avoid any potential adverse impacts.

      "ENVIRONMENTAL PERFORMANCE 40 The primary raw material of Nucor’s steelmaking operations is recycled scrap steel or recycled steel. The process of recycling steel in an EAF generates particulate matter emissions that include contaminants such as paint, zinc, chrome and other metals. Initially, this particulate matter, known as EAF dust, is captured and collected in a pollution device called a baghouse. Because these contaminants contain valuable metals, the baghouse dust is recycled to recover these metals. Nucor sends all but a small fraction of the EAF dust it collects to recycling facilities that recover the zinc, lead, chrome and other valuable metals from this dust, which would otherwise be expensive to properly dispose of if it was classified as a hazardous waste under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA). Whenever possible, Nucor recycles other waste products from our production processes too. This not only prevents potential air and water pollution, it also provides raw materials for other industries. Nucor mills beneficially reuse steel slag in road materials as a granular base, embankments, engineered fill, highway shoulders, and hot mix asphalt pavement. The physical, chemical, mechanical and thermal properties of steel slag provide a vital resource for construction companies and activities. RECYCLING\n",
      "41 POLICY ENGAGEMENT\n",
      "POLICY ENGAGEMENT 42 As North America’s largest steel company, Nucor regularly engages with government officials on regulatory and policy issues that concern our company and the U.S. steel industry, as well as the broader manufacturing sector in which many of our customers operate. Our key priorities include leveling the playing field for trade, infrastructure investment, strong Buy America provisions and creating greater awareness of the essential role EAF produced steel must play in a modern and sustainable economy. In recent years, we have been taking a more proactive stance with respect to policy initiatives aimed at mitigating climate change. We are educating policymakers about the energy, emissions and recycling advantages of EAF steel production and the need to balance trade and climate policies to guard against offshoring and carbon leakage. After years of discussion and months of debate in Congress, the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (the “IIJA”) was signed into law on November 15, 2021. The IIJA is historic bipartisan legislation that will provide $973 billion in funding over the next five years to modernize America’s “hard infrastructure” like roads, bridges, inland waterways, ports, electric grids and other critical projects. Nucor supported the IIJA and the legislation contains an estimated $850 billion in steel-containing investments. The new law also contains several Buy America requirements that will ensure our nation’s infrastructure will be built using the cleanest steel and steel products made here at home by an American workforce. For many years, we have been making investments in capacity that will help us meet the increased demand for steel generated by the IIJA. As roughly 50% of Nucor’s products go into the construction market, we stand ready to help our country meet its infrastructure needs. INFRASTRUCTURE\n",
      "TRADE — LEVELING THE PLAYING FIELD Nucor advocates for a level playing field for American steel manufacturers. The governments of many countries subsidize — or even own — steel producing companies, and this often leads to these companies selling steel at artificially low prices that are harmful to the American steel industry. Foreign steel is also oftentimes produced in a manner that disproportionately impacts the environment and doesn’t protect worker safety to the levels we have come to expect in the United States. The steel Nucor manufactures at our facilities throughout the U.S. is simply more sustainable on many levels. It is made with a higher percentage of recycled content, less and cleaner energy, and consequently produces lower GHG emissions per ton produced. In addition, steel manufacturing in the United States must comply with strict standards for worker safety and environmental protection, as required by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and other regulatory agencies. In practice, we strive to far outperform minimum regulatory requirements such as these and keep our focus on what is best for long-term value creation that benefits all our stakeholders. POLICY ENGAGEMENT 43 With a score of 85.7%, Nucor advanced to the First Tier of companies scored by the 2021 CPA- Zicklin Index, which seeks to bring transparency and accountability to corporate political spending. We continue to evaluate our lobbying activities and political disclosures, aiming for best-in-class standing for both accountability and effectiveness at advancing the interests of Nucor and its stakeholders.\n",
      "POLICY ENGAGEMENT 44 Nucor has a dedicated Public Affairs team which manages our efforts to provide clear and relevant information to governmental agencies and legislative bodies charged with regulating the U.S. steel industry. While doing so, this team conducts itself in a manner consistent with our Standards of Business Conduct and Ethics and adheres to all applicable laws and regulations regarding lobbying activities. On a regular basis, the Public Affairs team presents policy priorities, initiatives and expenditures to our Board of Directors and our Governance and Nominating Committee, which has oversight of all lobbying activities. We file quarterly lobbying disclosure forms with the Clerk of the House of Representatives and the Secretary of the Senate as required by the federal Lobbying Disclosure Act. Disclosure forms are also filed as necessary in the 21 states where we engage in lobbying. Nucor complies with federal, state, and local campaign finance laws and regulations governing political contributions and the disclosure of these contributions. In accordance with federal law, Nucor does not contribute to any political candidates, parties or committees at the federal level. Contributions to federal candidates and committees are allowed only through the Nucor Corporation Political Action Committee, which is funded through voluntary contributions from eligible U.S. teammates. Nucor PAC fully discloses all contributions made and received through reports filed with the Federal Election Commission. Our lobbying efforts and contributions are used to promote policies favorable to the steel industry and they are not based on the political preferences of any individual employed by Nucor.

      "45 COMMUNITY & LOCAL STEWARDSHIP\n",
      "COMMUNITY & LOCAL STEWARDSHIP 46 Nucor’s cultural focus on safety and teamwork means how we care for everyone in the Nucor family is central to our mission. When Nucor joins a community, we consider our neighbors part of the Nucor family, too. That’s why Nucor is dedicated to the communities where we live and work. Our teammates are empowered to engage their local communities in the same way they are empowered to make independent decisions on the job. As a result, Nucor divisions and teammates contribute time, money and materials to a diverse range of local charities and causes. In the past year, Nucor donated over $7 million to local organizations, this figure does not include monies raised by teammates. From schools to hospitals, from veterans to first responders, our community support is driven by the passions of our teammates, not by our corporate headquarters. In late August of 2021, Hurricane Ida devastated communities across Louisiana, before spreading tornadoes and flooding across the northeastern U.S. As a Category 4 storm, Hurricane Ida was the second-most damaging storm to make landfall in Louisiana, behind Katrina in 2005. Even though our Nucor teammates in Louisiana were themselves without power for more than two weeks, they began coordinating relief drives for their communities. Nucor teammates from across the nation sent money and materials, including truckloads of water, generators and other much-needed emergency supplies. As the supplies arrived, Nucor Louisiana teammates hosted distribution events, providing hot meals and relief equipment to their neighbors in need. In the months that followed, Nucor Steel Louisiana continued to provide aid to those still rebuilding. In the fall, Nucor provided fresh produce and groceries to staff at St. James Parish Hospital as they worked to care for the community in the wake of the dual challenges of Ida and COVID-19. During the holidays, Nucor teammates partnered with the local United Way and Associated Grocers to help impacted students and staff in the local school districts buy groceries. BEING A GOOD NEIGHBOR IN LOUISIANA\n",
      "COMMUNITY & LOCAL STEWARDSHIP 47 As health care workers across North America worked tirelessly to care for their communities in the midst of a pandemic, Nucor teammates found ways big and small to support them in their missions. Teams like those at CBC Steel Buildings in California and Nucor Steel, Fastener and Cold Finish in Indiana provided meals to staff at their local hospitals. Others donated money directly to the hospitals for treatment, like our teammates at Nucor-Yamato and Nucor Steel Arkansas. Nucor and DJJ teams in Utah purchased an updated ambulance to help first responders provide better care. And teammates at Nucor Steel Berkeley volunteered their time to assist with vaccination efforts in South Carolina. Nucor teammates from across the country worked together this fall to help clean up their communities. From highways to bike trails and parks to riverbanks, the women and men of the Nucor family, including Nucor Tubular, Skyline and Vulcraft teams, stepped up to remove trash and debris from the public spaces that we share with our neighbors. But we also tackle larger challenges. Just two weeks before Christmas, tornados left a path of destruction across Arkansas, Missouri, Tennessee and Kentucky. Nucor teammates in Arkansas, Indiana, Kentucky, Louisiana, and Texas stepped up to help, volunteering not just to clean up debris, but also to cook and serve meals, to distribute emergency supplies, and to provide financial aid for storm relief. PARTNERS FOR HEALTHY COMMUNITIES TAKING CHARGE OF CLEANING UP These are just a few examples of the projects the Nucor family takes on every year to make our home communities stronger.

      "Air Products | 2022 Sustainability Report At this writing, our world is confronted by incomparable challenges. Regions of the world still face the COVID-19 pandemic or variants. We remain deeply concerned by tragic human suffering in Ukraine and condemn actions of war when the world should be making greater efforts for peace. The global threat of climate change also remains very real. There is much talk about the energy transition but talk alone is insufficient to address climate change. Companies and countries taking real action through real investment in real projects is what will make a meaningful difference. At Air Products, I am proud that our more than 20,000 worldwide employees are taking real action, developing and executing first-mover projects providing real sustainability benefits. In doing so, they are living our higher purpose as a Company and bringing lower-carbon forms of energy to the world. For example, Air Products is teaming up with World Energy to build a new $2 billion major expansion project at World Energy’s California Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) production and distribution hub. It will be the world’s first commercial scale and North America’s only SAF production facility, expanding total fuel capacity to 340 million gallons annually. Air Products is building a $4.5 billion clean energy complex in Louisiana to produce low-carbon hydrogen that will reduce our customers’ carbon intensity and reduce transportation emissions. We are also building a multi-billion-dollar net-zero hydrogen energy complex in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada that will help our customers reduce carbon intensities, provide emissions-free fuel in the transportation sector, and generate clean electricity. These projects complement our multi-billion-dollar green ammonia production facility joint venture in NEOM, Saudi Arabia that will make and export carbon-free hydrogen to global transportation markets. These projects are tangible energy transition difference makers. Importantly, Air Products already makes a difference every day through the industrial gases and technologies we supply our customers to improve the sustainability of their operations. In 2021, Air Products’ customer-avoided carbon dioxide emissions (CO2e) totaled 82 million metric tons, or more than three times our own combined Scope 1 and 2 CO2e emissions. We remain confident in meeting our challenging “Third by ’30” carbon intensity reduction goal while we reimagine what’s possible in the future. While working to support the energy transition and our customers, we also remain committed to our employees. Safety will forever be a priority at Air Products, with the ultimate goal of zero injuries. To drive our goal to be the world’s most diverse industrial gas company we set goals for female representation globally and for minority representation in the U.S. in our professional and managerial population by 2025. In 2021, we exceeded our previous goal for minority representation in U.S. professional and managerial roles and set a new, stretch goal. These achievements are only possible through the commitment and motivation of the team at Air Products. Our people are the real enablers of a cleaner future, working alongside our customers to help solve pressing energy and environmental challenges.

      "Air Products | 2022 Sustainability Report Hydrogen for Mobility and the Energy Transition Hydrogen plays a key role in helping the world move forward with the energy transition and in building a cleaner, more sustainable future. As the world’s leading producer of hydrogen, Air Products is playing a major role in making that happen. We have more than six decades of experience and knowledge of every facet of the hydrogen value chain, from production to distribution to storage and dispensing. With over 110 hydrogen production facilities, we have nearly 9,000 tons of daily capacity. From small onsite generators to world-scale steam methane reformers, gasifiers and electrolyzers, hydrogen production is core to Air Products’ business. We have already taken major steps to build the hydrogen economy and have hands-on operating experience on over 250 hydrogen fueling station projects in 20 countries. Our hydrogen dispensing technology, which mirrors traditional consumer gasoline fueling, is used in more than 1.5 million fueling operations annually. Buses, trucks, and other heavy-duty vehicles from Asia to Europe to North America are fueled with hydrogen produced, distributed and supplied by Air Products. The key now is scaling up to create the hydrogen infrastructure that businesses and governments need to make the switch to this clean energy on a major scale, giving users confidence in a secure, reliable and consistent source of hydrogen. Air Products’ landmark investments in green and blue hydrogen will help deliver carbon-free and low-carbon hydrogen to the world. At NEOM in Saudi Arabia, we and our partners have committed billions to create the world’s largest green hydrogen project. When that facility comes onstream in 2026 it will supply 650 tons per day of carbon-free hydrogen to power buses and trucks around the world and eliminate three million tons of CO2 annually, which is equivalent to eliminating the emissions from 700,000 cars. Air Products will be the global leader in green hydrogen after commercializing the NEOM project. Air Products’ blue hydrogen projects in Canada and the U.S. combine our advanced technologies for gasification, carbon capture and storage, and lower carbon hydrogen. In Canada, these technologies plus hydrogen-fueled power generation make it possible to operate the facility with a net-zero carbon footprint. After executing these projects, Air Products will be the global leader in blue hydrogen. Please see “Landmark blue hydrogen projects” for additional details. Air Products is also building a green liquid hydrogen production facility in Arizona that will produce liquid hydrogen to be sold to the hydrogen for mobility market in California and other locations requiring zero-carbon hydrogen fuel. Our goal is to meet our customers wherever they are along their sustainability journey and provide the hydrogen they need. As interest in sustainability continues to grow, so will interest in hydrogen. Gasification Carbon Capture Hydrogen for Mobility Gasification Our Purpose and Strategy Strategy Customers Environment Climate Employees Communities Appendix 6\n",
      "Air Products | 2022 Sustainability Report Interest in hydrogen for mobility increased substantially in 2021, prompting many projects that demonstrated the benefits and viability of using hydrogen fuel cell technology. For example, we commissioned new fueling stations and supported the expansion of others, such as the “United Kingdom” (UK) fueling station at Heathrow Airport. Our Carburos Metálicos team in Spain initiated an intercity green hydrogen bus tour to highlight its ease of use and ability to enable a zero-emissions public transportation system. Carburos Metálicos also commissioned a hydrogen fueling station to supply renewable hydrogen to city buses in Madrid. In addition, Air Products supported demonstration projects for using hydrogen in locomotives and buses in Poland, and heavy- duty trucks in France. In the U.S., Air Products fueled hydrogen bus demonstrations in several cities in Oregon and Washington to showcase a zero-emission fleet option for local transit agencies. In China, Air Products installed its first hydrogen fueling station in Shandong Province, which supports China’s “Hydrogen into Ten Thousand Homes” project and supplied hydrogen for fuel cell electric vehicles used to shuttle athletes at the Beijing Olympic games. The Company also unveiled a new hydrogen fueling station at its industrial gas facility in Ulsan City, South Korea. Driving the use of hydrogen around the world Our Purpose and Strategy Carbon Capture We view carbon capture as a necessary and high-impact way to tackle climate change and essential to meeting the Paris climate goals and beyond. At the same time, we understand that implementation of carbon capture requires supportive policies, favorable project economics, and strong partnerships with governments and our customers. Air Products is developing proprietary carbon dioxide storage and utilization technologies that we plan to deploy in high return carbon capture projects. We have demonstrated the viability of capturing carbon from hydrogen plants through our Port Arthur, Texas CO2 purification and capture project. This facility, the largest of its type in the industrial gas industry, captures nearly one million tons of CO2 annually that is used in enhanced oil recovery. Gasification We view gasification as one of the many tools necessary to help countries and customers meet the world’s growing need for cleaner, sustainable chemicals and materials. Gasification plants typically convert low value hydrocarbons into useful chemicals and energy while significantly reducing harmful pollutants like sulfur oxides. The process produces carbon dioxide as a by-product that can be easily captured in a concen- trated form, providing a pathway to reduce emissions where market conditions support carbon sequestra- tion or utilization. New gasification technologies continue to emerge, opening routes to alternative feed- stocks such as sustainable biomass and the use of waste materials in support of the circular economy.

Air Products is building a multi-billion dollar landmark hydrogen energy complex that will begin with a transformative net-zero hydrogen production and liquefaction facility expected onstream in 2024. Air Products will deploy advanced hydrogen technology and an innovative design to deliver net-zero emissions. The new facility will capture over 95 percent of the CO₂ from the feedstock natural gas and store it safely back underground. Hydrogen-fueled electricity will offset the remaining five percent of emissions. The clean energy complex will help refining and petrochemical customers served by the Air Products Heartland Hydrogen Pipeline to reduce their carbon intensity. The complex also marks a first in the wider use of hydrogen in Alberta, enabling the production of liquid hydrogen to be an emissions-free fuel in the transportation sector, and to generate clean electricity. This facility will make Alberta a leading supplier of liquid hydrogen to western Canada and the Pacific Northwest of the United States, with enough liquid hydrogen capacity to fuel every public transit agency across Alberta. Air Products is investing $4.5 billion (USD) to build, own and operate a clean energy complex that will produce over 750 million standard cubic feet per day of blue hydrogen in Louisiana. A portion of the blue hydrogen will be compressed and supplied to customers by our U.S. Gulf Coast hydrogen pipeline network – the world’s largest. The balance will be used to make blue ammonia that will be transported around the globe and converted back to blue hydrogen for transportation and other markets. The Louisiana project is expected to be operational in 2026. This megaproject will also capture and permanently sequester over five million metric tons per year of CO₂, making it the largest carbon capture for sequestration facility in the world.

Air Products evaluates these offerings using a consistent life-cycle derived approach that compares the offerings to equivalent benchmark technologies across key sustainability criteria such as resource use, emissions, safety, customer productivity, and societal factors, among others. Offerings have been considered across all segments of our businesses, and over 100 offerings have been reviewed with our Customer Technology Team. The offerings that have the most significant positive impacts on sustainability are categorized as Sustainable Offerings. Sales of Sustainable Offerings provide the basis for our customer avoided emissions, which represent reductions in carbon intensity compared to benchmark technologies. Included in our avoided emissions are several of the Sustainable Offerings described in this section, such as the production of cleaner transportation fuels using hydrogen, the reduction of food waste due to the use of our gases and lower energy consumption from the use of oxyfuel and argon for window insulation. Hydrogen Much of Air Products’ hydrogen supply today is used in the production of cleaner traditional transportation fuels. It is used to refine heavier, sour crudes to increase refinery yields and reduce emissions through the production of cleaner fuels including ultra-low sulfur diesel fuel. As noted in “Our Purpose and Strategy” hydrogen is an essential part of de- carbonizing the transportation sector, particularly heavy-duty vehicles. Many other industries such as electronics, food, glass, chemicals, and more also benefit from hydrogen’s unique properties to improve qual- ity, optimize performance, and reduce costs. As the world’s largest provider of hydrogen, Air Products operates over 110 hydrogen plants, including some with liquefaction capabilities, and which have the equivalent of a combined 1,500 years of safe and reliable operating experience. In many cases, we provide hydrogen from pipeline systems around the globe, including the world’s largest hydrogen pipeline net- work and system located in the U.S. Gulf Coast. Helium Helium and our high purity medical gases help sustain life. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is dependent on helium, which is used to keep MRI magnets cold and superconducting. Helium is also valued as a gas for lifting, breathing, leak detection, space exploration, semiconductor manufacturing, scientific applications, and shielding. It has unique properties that optimize performance and productivity, reduce labor costs, and improve safety. As a leading producer and supplier of helium, Air Products has pioneered many of the helium extraction, production, distribution, and storage technologies still in use – including cryogenic equipment for most of the world’s helium recovery plants.

      "Air Products | 2022 Sustainability Report Why It’s Important Addressing sustainability challenges requires ingenuity, innovation, and partnership. For example, as population and prosperity increase around the world, including in emerging markets, so will the demand for energy. This higher demand must be met through cleaner energy solutions and improved energy efficiency. The same is needed to address climate change and increased demand for food, water, and other valuable resources. What We’re Doing Our research groups are aligned with our businesses and focus on improving our processes and innovating for our customers. Research and Development (R&D) concentrates on new and improved production and delivery of industrial gases and new or improved applications for industrial gas products that help our customers improve sustainability. Air Products also funds and cooperates in R&D programs conducted by world-renowned universities and other technology organizations. R&D is conducted principally at our Technology Centers in the United States (Allentown, Pennsylvania), the United Kingdom (Basingstoke, Hersham and Carrington), China (Shanghai), and Saudi Arabia (Dhahran). Our R&D strategy reflects our support of the global energy transition by emphasizing the optimization and integration of technologies needed for the success of our world-scale energy projects. Specifically, our R&D teams are focused on developing and enhancing technologies related to hydrogen, gasification, electrolysis, and ammonia as a hydrogen carrier, which are key to executing our business strategy. In addition to our significant R&D efforts, Air Products continues to innovate through new projects, particularly through the commercialization of cutting- edge green and blue hydrogen production technology and carbon capture technologies. Due to regulatory and market demands, Air Products will help supply a growing need for lower carbon intensity hydrogen, both in existing applications and innovative expanded uses, such as the growing hydrogen for mobility market. Innovation $93.5 million in R&D was spent in 2021. Nearly 70% of this spending supported products and processes that improved sustainability. Reduced flaring during LNG plant start-up the 12-hour cooldown. The reduced flaring cooldown method has been utilized at new facilities and retrofitted to existing ones, with excellent feedback from customers. Innovations continue with the new development of an automated cooldown process resulting in even greater flare reduction and reduced thermal stress on equipment. Air Products has patented the AP- AutoCool™ Program which allows the main cryogenic heat exchanger to be cooled automatically with minimal human interaction. Air Products is currently working with customers to implement the AP-AutoCool Program. During the startup of an LNG facility, natural gas must be flared as the plant is brought onstream. This flaring consumes excess feed gas, creating CO2 emissions in the process. Air Products has developed an improved start-up method that reduces flaring. The new method, termed reduced flaring cooldown, eliminates the pre-cooldown step and results in less flaring and faster, more consistent start- ups. The process has been successfully implemented in several operating facilities where the cooldown time has been reduced by up to 25 percent while reducing the amount of natural gas flared and CO2 emissions during Strategy Customers Environment Climate Employees Communities Appendix 17\n",

Innovation Marine nitrogen generators for hybrid propulsion As the global shipping industry moves toward decarbonization, the integration of alternative fuels and use of hybrid-fueled engines is increasing rapidly. Driven by International Maritime Organization (IMO) targets, which call for 40 and 70 percent reductions in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 2030 and 2050 respectively, the shipping industry is undergoing significant change. Alternative fuels, such as LNG, petroleum gas and methanol, can offer over 20 percent reduction in emissions compared to traditional fuels. Inert nitrogen gas is required for safe operation of engines that utilize these “low flashpoint fuels.” Given the limited space on ships and the changes driven by decarbonization regulations, Air Products’ small-sized, marine nitrogen systems have seen increased demand for on-board production of this inert gas for use in container ships, dry bulk carriers, cruise ships and car carriers. In the more distant future, long distance shipping will most likely involve hydrogen, including ammonia and synthetic fuels, as the most practical pathway toward gaining zero emissions for ships. This will eventually shift ships’ motor propulsion systems toward hydrogen fuel cell technology. Further on-ship nitrogen generation will continue to be important for the shipping industry, as nitrogen will be required for the safe handling of these fuels regardless of fuel source.

      "Air Products | 2022 Sustainability Report Air Products is making significant investments in lower carbon hydrogen for the world, including our share of the $7 billion (USD) NEOM project, the world’s largest green hydrogen energy project. Through this project, we will supply carbon-free green hydrogen to power buses and trucks around the world by 2026, eliminating three million tons per year of CO₂ emissions, the equivalent of emissions from over 700,000 cars. We are also investing in blue hydrogen projects in Canada and the U.S. to support the world’s transition to lower carbon energy. We are committed to improving our own performance by operating efficiently, incorporating environmental considerations into the design of our facilities and products, effectively managing environmental risks, and transparently communicating our environmental performance. While our resource consumption and emissions may increase due to growing societal and customer demands for our products, our efficiency and environmental improvements enable us to make our customers’ processes and products better through higher productivity, improved energy efficiency, and lower emissions. We encourage suppliers to incorporate environmental sustainability into their operations and supply chains as described in the principles outlined in our sustainability expectations of our suppliers. Protecting the Environment Efficient Use of Resources The principal raw materials for making atmospheric gases and hydrogen are air, energy as electricity or steam, and natural gas and other hydrocarbons. Air, which is considered by many to be a renewable resource, represents more than 95 percent of the raw material we use on a weight basis. Similarly, more than 80 percent of the raw material used for our carbon dioxide business is from renewable sources. Industrial gas manufacturing is energy intensive. ASUs require electricity or steam to compress air so it can be cryogenically distilled into oxygen, nitrogen, and argon. Likewise, the production of hydrogen consumes natural gas, and in some cases refinery off-gas, as a feedstock and/or fuel in the production process. Packaging is not a significant issue for Air Products because we supply most of our products in two-way bulk containers, semi-bulk containers or via pipelines. For small-scale supply in certain regions of the world, we use cylinders that are long life, returnable, and reusable transportable pressure vessels with typical life spans of 20+ years.

For example, the vertical structure of the building lessens the “heat island” effect, which is typically caused by large expanses of asphalt being heated by the sun. It also improves storm water run-off and drainage management, and the collected water is used for irrigation purposes. Likewise, the use of local species of plants and amended soil help retain water and increase nutrients. Other aspects of our sustainable design include the installation of solar panels on the garage walls and roof. Those panels will supply a portion of the energy required onsite. A light harvesting system uses daylight to offset the amount of electric lighting needed and lighting control systems dim brightness in response to changing daylight and occupancy. Other features of the building include the use of recycled materials in its design and ongoing operation, as well as low-water-use fixtures to help minimize water consumption. Safety and security have also been considered at every step in the project, from handrails on the stairs to security systems that help keep our people safe. We also built features into the site that promote employee health and wellness, such as healthy food and beverages and opportunities for exercise through the fitness center, walking paths and sidewalks. At our new headquarters, we are able to do the same great work while using less energy and water, emitting less carbon, and ensuring a safe, secure, and healthy work environment. We had been in our prior headquarters for 60 years. It served us well, and now we are repurposing what we can from our prior home by finding new uses for the furniture and other equipment, supporting non-profit organizations in nearby communities.

      "Air Products | 2022 Sustainability Report Why It’s Important Energy consumption and CO2 emissions are inextricably linked. We are supporting the world’s need for clean, sustainable energy – and energy that protects our environment and moves us all toward a better future. What We’re Doing As the world transitions to lower carbon energy sources, Air Products will lead the way by producing and distributing clean hydrogen energy solutions for use in heavy-duty fuel cell vehicles, industrial applications and energy storage. We are helping to build a vibrant pathway to a cleaner energy future. We believe a diverse mix of solutions is needed to meet clean energy needs while reducing GHGs. For example, we supply vast quantities of hydrogen to petroleum refiners to lower sulfur content and produce cleaner-burning gasoline and diesel fuels. Likewise, our oxy-fuel burners improve productivity for glass and metal manufacturers while reducing energy consumption and emissions. We also have leading technologies for gasification, carbon capture and hydrogen for mobility and the broader energy transition. The production of industrial gases is energy intensive, which is why we have continually increased the energy efficiency of our ASU and hydrogen and carbon monoxide (HyCO) facilities through improved plant designs and efficient operations. These efforts also reduce CO2 emissions and water consumption. In fact, improving energy efficiency is one of the five mechanisms we are focused on to meet our “Third by ‘30” CO2 emissions intensity reduction goal. Energy consumption is the most significant variable in the cost of our production processes. We carefully track and manage energy purchases, and our conservation programs are focused on continually improving energy efficiency across our plants, particularly larger facilities. Efficiency improvements are realized through higher plant utilization, increased production at new, larger, and more efficient facilities and through facility improvement projects. Several of our facilities have been certified to the ISO 50001 Energy Standard. Additional information about how we manage climate change risks is provided in our Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) summary.

      "Air Products | 2022 Sustainability Report Air Products at COP26 Air Products was proud to be the headline partner of Climate Action’s Hydrogen Transition Summit at COP26. Seifi Ghasemi, Air Products’ Chairman, President and CEO delivered the opening keynote speech, which positioned hydrogen as the energy source for the future and highlighted what governments can do to help further stimulate the transition to green energy. Ivo Bols, Air Products’ President for Europe and Africa, participated in a Climate Leaders Live Fireside Chat at the Hydrogen Transition Summit and discussed the steps needed to build a hydrogen economy and how quickly the economy can be established. Bols also participated on a panel at the Sustainable Innovation Forum about “game changers” in the Hydrogen Economy that focused on the innovation and technological acceleration needed to make the hydrogen economy work for heavy industry and transport. While world leaders discussed key climate change issues at COP26, young people from across the United Kingdom came together virtually at ‘STEM Ambassadors: Careers in Climate Change.’ This 360˚online careers exhibition was aimed at 13–18-year-olds who were interested in pursuing a sustainability-related career and enabled them to explore the work of 30 companies adapting to the challenges of climate change. Air Products’ successful virtual stand at the event focused on who we are, our sustainable solutions, and Hydrogen for Mobility projects, and drew over 2,900 unique users and over 500 different UK schools and colleges and overseas visitors from as far away as Australia, Pakistan, and the United States. Our Commitments and Contributions Through our “Third by ‘30” CO2 emissions intensity reduction goal, Air Products aims to reduce our CO2 emissions intensity by one-third by the year 2030 from a 2015 baseline. The goal is fully aligned with our business strategy, is near-term and measurable, and holds us accountable for delivering. We plan to deliver on our CO2 intensity reduction goal through five mechanisms: executing carbon capture projects, producing carbon-free hydrogen, executing low-carbon projects, continuing to improve our operations, and increasing our use of renewable energy. Air Products does not purchase carbon offsets to lower its emissions. Air Products calculates carbon intensity as the total of our Scope 1 and 2 emissions divided by the energy equivalents of the products we sell.

      "Air Products | 2022 Sustainability Report Our total energy consumption across our businesses in 2021 was 52.7 terawatt hours (TWh), representing a nine percent increase from 2020. The increase was a result of higher ASU plant loadings as the economy recovered from COVID-19 and acquisitions. As a result of this increased demand and energy usage, our total CO2 emissions increased slightly in 2021. Our direct (Scope 1) and indirect (Scope 2) CO2 emissions are related to the energy we consume. In 2021, our Scope 1 GHG emissions, which are primarily from our HyCO operations were 14.8 million metric tons (MT), representing a 1.5 percent decrease from the prior year. Our Scope 2 emissions, which are due in large part to the electricity and steam we consume in our ASUs, were 9.4 million MT in 2021, which was an 2.4 percent increase from 2020. In 2021, Air Products enabled its customers and their customers to avoid 82 million MT of CO2e, which was more than three times Air Products’ combined Scope 1 and 2 emissions. Our Scope 3 emissions were 7.6 million MT and included three categories: upstream fuel and energy related activities, use of sold products, and investments. We have initiated discussions with some of our largest suppliers and equity affiliates on reducing Scope 3 CO2 emissions. Please see the GRI Content Index for additional information on the breakdown of our GHG data. Our CO2 emissions for 2021 were externally verified by GHD Limited. Energizing with Renewables Increasing our renewable energy use is a key mechanism in progressing toward our new “Third by ‘30” CO2 emissions intensity reduction goal. In 2021, we increased global procurement of renewable electricity by 14 percent compared to 2020. Overall, 27 percent of our electricity was from renewable sources in 2021. We purchase renewable electricity directly through our energy suppliers or by buying Renewable Energy Certificates (RECs) that link our power consumption to a specific asset that generates renewable electricity. For example, in 2021 we began receiving electricity purchased from a new large-scale solar plant in the southwest U.S. for a large ASU. In Poland we signed a virtual power purchase agreement for wind energy, the CO2 savings from which equate to the emissions of 8,500 passenger cars driven over one year or CO2 sequestered by over 650,000 trees in 10 years.

      "Air Products | 2022 Sustainability Report Improving Distribution Efficiency We have trucking fleets around the world that are focused on safely and ef- ficiently delivering our products to our customers. To improve our distribution efficiency and reduce our Scope 1 CO2 emissions, we have many initiatives un- derway, including investments in new trucks, trailers, technology, and facilities. Continuing efforts to modernize our fleets with new, more efficient trucks have increased fuel efficiency. Distribution efficiency has also been improved through the addition of trailers with higher payloads. In 2021 we launched a program to convert our distribution fleet to hydrogen. We also have increased the number of hybrid cars in our vehicle fleet. Technology is also key to improving distribution efficiency and we are us- ing data to help our truck delivery drivers be more agile in addressing driving parameters they can control, such as revving and idling. This is complemented by improvements in scheduling that improve efficiency, reduce miles, and decrease return trips. Climate Scenario Analysis Scenario analysis is a tool that evaluates the potential effects of future events on an organization, such as climate change. Air Products has continued to evaluate climate scenarios that are in line with the recommendations of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and TCFD, examining potential climate-related risks and opportunities on our businesses. We also purchase renewable electricity directly in the United Kingdom, and through Renewable Energy Guarantees of Origin (REGOs), a type of REC. In other parts of Europe, the RECs are called Guarantees of Origin (GOs) that demonstrate the electricity we use comes from renewable sources. In 2021, we continued to purchase electricity covered by GOs in Spain and France, where we have linked to ENGIE’s The Energy Origin (TEO), a blockchain approach that substantiates the renewable origin of the electricity we consume and is the first renewable energy blockchain to be validated by an independent third-party. Air Products has installed solar arrays at several of its facilities around the world to generate renewable electricity for use at our sites. Company facilities with solar arrays include: • Keumiée, Belgium • Zoldar, Belgum • Araraquara, Brazil • Belo Horizonte, Brazil • Pyeongtaek, Korea • Botlek, The Netherlands • Halfweg, The Netherlands • Allentown, Pennsylvania, U.S. • Massalfassar, Spain • Tainan, Taiwan • Kuan Yin, Taiwan Converting our distribution fleet to hydrogen Air Products believes hydrogen is the future for heavy duty segments of the transportation market. We are demonstrating the merits of hydrogen by being a first-mover in transitioning our heavy-duty fleet of trucks to hydrogen fuel cell electric vehicles. In 2021, we signed a memorandum of understanding with Cummins, Inc. to work together to accelerate the integration of hydrogen fuel cell trucks in the Americas, Europe and Asia. Cummins, Inc. will provide hydrogen fuel cell electric powertrains integrated into selected Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) partners’ heavy-duty trucks for Air Products, as Air Products begins the process of converting its global fleet of distribution vehicles to hydrogen fuel cell vehicles. Following a successful demonstration and pilot phase, Air Products plans to convert its global fleet of approximately 2,000 trucks to hydrogen fuel cell zero-emission vehicles. Air Products is also pursuing new hydrogen fueling stations to support its growing fleet of hydrogen fuel cell electric vehicles.

      "Air Products | 2022 Sustainability Report Why It’s Important Water is critical to the health and sustainability of our world. Unlike cli- mate change, which is a global issue, water is a local concern as consum- ers rely on nearby sources for this important resource. Efforts to con- serve water are needed, particularly in areas where water demand is high or exceeds supply. What We’re Doing We use water primarily for cooling, to make hydrogen using the steam methane reforming (SMR) process, and to provide steam and water to our customers. The steam is a co-product of our SMRs and has a significant energy efficiency advantage and related environmental benefits when compared to steam generated in boilers. Because of the way we use water, our water consumption is tied closely to en- ergy use. Therefore, improvements in energy efficiency can also reduce water consumption. We have also saved water by improving cooling tower operations and converting to the use of recycled gray water in our plants, when possible, particularly in Southern California where water is stressed. Across our plants, we estimate that four percent of our water was from recycled sources in 2021. Our Commitments and Contributions Air Products is committed to increasing energy efficiency and promoting the responsible use of water. In 2021, our water consumption declined by 16 percent on an intensity basis compared to 2020. Our consumption of water, on an absolute basis, was 13.3 billion gallons in 2021.

      "Air Products | 2022 Sustainability Report Business Opportunities for Water Treatment Customers use our technologies to im- prove water quality and treat waste- water. Our offerings include: pure oxygen aeration systems for waste- water treatment and aquaculture; oxygen for ozone generation; carbon dioxide for pH adjustment and drink- ing water remineralization; and ozone and advanced oxidation systems for wastewater treatment. Water Conservation Saving water while reducing hazardous chemicals Cooling towers are used to remove heat from industrial processes and represent a significant use of water and water treatment chemicals for Air Products. To minimize resource consumption, optimize heat transfer, and comply with regulatory requirements, the water flowing through the tower must be effectively managed and treated. For example, one of the most critical elements of cooling tower water treatment is to prevent the spread of Legionella bacteria. In 2021, Air Products tested several water treatment chemicals and systems with the goals of reducing chemical use and water consumption. One of the trials demonstrated the successful use of a chemical that could replace benzotriazole, which may be classified as a carcinogen, mutagen, reproductive toxin. The treatment was successful – it used less and safer chemicals and did not increase water consumption. Another trial proved that super-chlorination of cooling tower water could be replaced with a monitoring and dosing system that prevented corrosion of the system, which can lead to leaks and increased water usage, as well as ensured the bacteria in the water was controlled. The final trial was successful in reducing the use of sulfuric acid in the water treatment and saved water. Air Products is looking to extend the use of these alternatives and processes at additional facilities. Strategy Customers Environment Climate Employees Communities Appendix 29\n",
      "Air Products | 2022 Sustainability Report Waste Industrial gas production does not generate significant waste. Acetylene manufacturing results in a by-product lime slurry that is considered a hazardous waste in some jurisdictions. This slurry is often beneficially reused in other processes, such as water neutralization, brick production, and in hardening materials in landfills. Other sources of hazardous waste include spent catalysts, waste oils and solvents, waste paint, and materials used to clean up small spills. All waste is managed and treated in accordance with the regulatory requirements of the jurisdiction in which the waste is generated. Waste that cannot be recycled is disposed of in an environmentally sound and regulatory compliant manner. In 2021, the amount of hazardous waste we generated globally was 10.9 million pounds, and our non-hazardous waste in North America totaled 13.9 million pounds. Hazardous waste volumes decreased in 2021 due to fewer construction and maintenance projects. Additional waste data is provided in the GRI Content Index. Air Emissions The manufacture of atmospheric gases produces negligible Scope 1 and other air emissions. Most of our air emissions are from hydrogen manufacturing and utility operations that support our facilities. We monitor and report air emis- sions in accordance with applicable regulations. • Nitrogen Oxides (NOx) and Sulfer Oxides (SOx) are products of combustion and are primarily from fuel used in our boilers and steam methane reformers. • Other air pollutants result from the minor loss of materials used in our processes or solvents used in the maintenance of equipment. These include toxics under the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Toxic Release Inventory (TRI) program, other criteria pollutants, hazardous air pollutants (HAPs) and volatile organic chemicals (VOCs). Additional data on air emissions is provided in the GRI Content Index to this Report. Additional Environmental Measures Cerrillos, Chile Waste Minimization Air Products is committed to driving continuous improvement in our facilities around the world, particularly when it comes to the efficient use of resources, minimizing the environmental impacts of our operations, and contributing to the circular economy. This philosophy has been on display over the past year in our Cerillos, Chile electrode manufacturing facility, where the local team developed an innovative solution to eliminate steel waste. Until recently, the plant generated steel scrap from their production process, which could not be reincorporated in the production process. To compound that issue, a lack of an appropriate recycler meant that steel scrap had to be disposed of as solid waste. Seeing an opportunity to recycle the steel, the Cerillos team created an improved segregation system for metal waste at the plant. Additionally, the team engaged with one of the largest steel producing companies in Chile to recycle this metal waste stream. The Air Products Cerillos plant is now capable of recycling more than 300 tons of steel per year from its operations, and essentially 100 percent of the steel from the electrode plant is now recycled back into raw materials.

We do sell gas mixtures that contain small quantities of these substances, as well as some pure refrigerants, as permit- ted by applicable regulations. We also recover, recycle, and reclaim fluori- nated gases for destruction. Environmental Compliance Regulatory fines increased slightly in FY21 to $8,500 (USD) and 18 notices of violation were received in FY21 compared to 17 the prior year. There were no reportable spills. Environmental Justice Air Products views environmental jus- tice as an opportunity to engage with our host communities in inclusive and transparent dialogue, enabling our neighbors to inform activities and policies that may impact them. This is grounded in our belief that when companies and communities work together, local issues can be more effectively identified and addressed. It’s also why we have been building relationships and contributing to the well-being of our communities for over 80 years. We are committed to protecting the environment and the health, safety, and security of our employees, contractors, and the public as stated in our EHS Policy. The Policy also demonstrates our commitment to comply with all applicable environ- mental, health, and safety laws and regulations while continually improv- ing our performance in these areas. We believe these commitments – to our communities and to EHS – provide a strong foundation for engaging on and addressing environmental justice. Additional Environmental Measures Biodiversity Biodiversity is essential for life on Earth. Biodiverse ecosystems provide critical resources, such as clean air and water. Climate change and biodiversity are also linked, as ecosystems help regulate the global climate and biodiverse ecosys- tems are more resilient to climate change. Air Products’ commitment to biodiversity is embodied in our EHS Policy through which we commit to designing and operating our facilities in a man- ner that protects the environment and continually reduce the environmental impacts of our operations. Underpinning this policy is Air Products’ EHS Man- agement System, which contains numerous procedures designed to protect the environment and minimize potential ecosystem impacts. Air Products’ operations do not have a significant impact on biodiversity based on the Company’s environmental risk assessments and evaluation of Key Biodiversity Areas (KBAs). These assessments show that energy use has the highest potential for ecosystem impact followed by water consumption. Approximately 30 percent of our hydrogen facilities, which are among our largest consumers of energy and water, are within a 10 kilometer buffer zone of a KBA. From a water perspective, Air Products discharges water into eight Conservation International Biodiversity Hotspots, although discharge volumes were insignificant in 2021. For new projects, Air Products assesses potential health and safety, socioeco- nomic, cultural, and environmental impacts, including ecosystem consider- ations such as threatened and endangered species and wetlands. These assess- ments can influence where projects are located or require mitigation strategies to ensure the ecological health of the location and region is maintained or enhanced. In 2021, we initiated environmental site assessments of several major projects, including our new blue and green hydrogen facilities. We also develop and follow environmental mitigation plans to minimize impacts dur- ing construction. From a supply chain perspective, Air Products has identified energy sourcing as the area with the most significant potential for impact on biodiversity and has initiated a program to evaluate the biodiversity efforts of its key energy suppliers.

Excellent safety performance can lower business costs related to missed work, productivity impacts, and workers’ compensation. It also has been shown that safe work- places build employee trust, reduce absenteeism, and result in higher quality products that enhance busi- ness and society. What We’re Doing Safety is central to our Company goal of being the safest, most diverse, and most profitable industrial gas company in the world. We also believe it is a moral obligation. We want our employees to return home to their families safe and healthy. Our goal remains zero accidents and zero incidents. Our beliefs about safety have been instituted for decades through our Total Safety Values, which stress that nothing is more important than safety and that adherence to safety is a condition of employment. Our current leadership has built on this strong foundation, making us an even safer company. Year-on-year, we strive to improve safety for our colleagues, contractors, customers, and host communities. In 2021 we worked to enhance the safety of our industry, assuming leadership roles in all the major industrial gas trade associations and helping to improve and harmonize safety standards around the world. Our Commitments and Contributions Our goal is to be the safest industrial gas company. We have improved our employee lost-time injury rate by 75 percent and our recordable injury rate by 33 percent since 2014. Regrettably, we had a contractor fatality in 2021, and steps were taken to ensure the risks associated with this incident were identified, addressed, and communicated. Worker Safety Our Basic Safety Process (BSP), which has been continuously improved over its 15 years in existence, provides the framework for employee engagement in upholding and continually strengthening our safety performance. BSP is focused on preventative activities, such as planned inspections, observations, and behavior-based activities. Employees at all levels of the Company, includ- ing those under collective bargaining agreements, engage in coordinated BSP activities, such as sequential safety meetings that are held monthly for supervisors and their employees. Our “Master the Basics” mindset takes BSP one step further by giving employees a mental checklist to use before undertaking any task. That checklist includes being aware of surroundings, knowing physical limitations, following procedures, using the proper personal protective equipment (PPE), and thinking before acting.

      "Air Products | 2022 Sustainability Report Process Safety Staying on top of potential process safety hazards is one of the most important aspects of managing safety. To promote process safety, we apply sound engineering principles to design, construct, operate and maintain our plants and equipment while minimizing process related hazards. Our program considers regulatory requirements, such as the Occupational Safety and Health Administration’s (OSHA) Process Safety Management in the U.S. and the European Union’s Seveso Directive, and includes procedures, training, hazard assessments and quantified risk analysis. Product Safety Essential to product safety is ensuring customers and others handling our products have complete safety information. To prepare this information, we have conducted product safety reviews for our commercial products. These reviews include characterizing the intrinsic environmental and health hazards of the products, examining product uses and creating management actions to address potential concerns. Likewise, our phased process for new technology development has been used to identify and address potential risks of new products and applications. Our high-volume liquid/bulk industrial gas products are non-toxic and can be handled safely with the appropriate procedures, equipment, and training. Less than one percent of Company revenues are from sales of toxic substances. Safety and Health Safety and Health Management at Air Products • Global Environmental, Health and Safety (EHS) Policy • Goals for employee, contractor, and transportation safety • Global EHS Management System, applicable to all operations, which contains safety and health standards and procedures, and which is aligned with ISO 45001 • Employee training based on job function • Risk assessment processes for workers, processes, products, transportation, and regulatory requirements • Compliance audits conducted by our EHS Assurance Team • Review of performance by our Board of Directors, Sustainability Leadership Council, Businesses and Operations, and members of our Safety and Health Centers of Excellence • Internal reporting of results on a monthly basis • External reporting on safety performance through our annual Sustainability Report, public website, and responses to various stakeholders • Management engagement with key shareholders on sustainability and safety Safety information from our product safety reviews is used in safety data sheets (SDS), which are a primary vehicle for communicating hazards information. We also share product hazards through labels that are compliant with the Globally Harmonized System (GHS), as well as internally developed Safetygrams and customer training. Fines related to product safety in 2021 were less than $300 (USD). Strategy Customers Environment Climate Employees Communities Appendix 35\n",
      "Air Products | 2022 Sustainability Report Transportation Safety Air Products’ drivers are the “face of the Company” to our customers and the public. Driver safety is supported through the safety features of our delivery vehicles, driver training, and our Data Enabled Coaching Program (DECP). The DECP relies on safety performance and vehicle efficiency data that are collected, recorded, and transmitted by event recording cameras in our trucks. DECP coaches use the data, including the videos, to help drivers be even safer and more efficient through preventative coaching and training. EHS Assurance In a typical year, our EHS Assurance Team will audit 30-40 facilities around the world for compliance with governmental requirements and our internal EHS procedures. In 2021, COVID-19 continued to impact our ability to visit some plants, especially those outside of the U.S. Despite these challenges, we completed all audits for the year either by our internal Assurance Team attending audits onsite or by leveraging regional EHS resources and third-party consultants with remote participation by our Assurance Team. Within the U.S., we completed all mandatory OSHA Process Safety Manage- ment and U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Risk Management Plan audits within the three-year time requirement. During the year we also added an internal Assurance Team member based in Shanghai to strengthen our EHS audit program across the Asia region. Emergency Preparedness and Crisis Management A critical part of BSP and our risk management effort is preparing for potential emergencies and crisis events. Every facility is required to have a site emergency plan, which employees train and practice. If a crisis involving one of our facilities or products occurs, our Crisis Manage- ment System is activated through our Global Security Operations Center (GSOC) that is available 24 hours a day, seven days a week and 365 days a year. The GSOC is the critical commu- nication hub for Air Products’ global emergency and crisis response to ac- tivate management resources. The Air Products Crisis Management System involves employees at all levels of the Company and marshals the resources and skills necessary to effectively lead in a crisis. Air Products’ people support Malaysia flood relief efforts In late December 2021, Malaysia experienced torrential rain that caused a “100 year” flood and forced more than 70,000 people from their homes. Klang Valley, where Air Products has several operations and where many of our employees live, was the most affected area. All employees were accounted for and safe, but many had damage to their homes and had to move to temporary shelters or relief centers. Air Products’ operations and assets were also impacted by flood water or distribution disruptions due to landslides and road closures. In the face of this natural disaster, the Southeast Asia team immediately set up a crisis management team, including members from management, Human Resources, EHS, Operations, and Supply Chain, and worked closely together to ensure our people and assets were protected and safe. The team worked tirelessly to return our facilities to normal operation while helping affected employees and the community where we operate. An employee volunteer drive was launched to help employees rebuild their homes, and monetary contributions received were matched by Air Products. The team also supported community relief efforts, assisting nearly 250 families in the community. These efforts clearly demonstrated Air Products’ commitment to safety and our community approach of “working here, living here, and giving here.” Safety and Health Strategy Customers Environment Climate Employees Communities Appendix 36\n",
      "Air Products | 2022 Sustainability Report Security Protecting our people, property, information and corporate reputation are top priorities at Air Products. Ensuring our assets and the communities where we operate are safe and secure is of paramount importance. Leading this effort is our Global Asset Protection (GAP) team, a diverse group of asset protection managers who are tasked with executing the foundational elements of risk and threat mitigation strategies for the corporation. GAP team members are strategically positioned in Asia, Europe, South America and the Middle East in support of our regional businesses. In fiscal 2021 our GAP team completed over 50 security vulnerability assess- ments to evaluate the security risks, vulnerabilities, consequences and mitigation measures relevant to Company operations. They also supported the Company’s Emergency Response and Crisis Management systems through drills and activations, nearly 40 of which were related to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Their in-depth travel security briefings and physical security protection measures promoted employee security. The GAP team also evaluated and engaged in the resolution of allegations submitted to our IntegrityLine. Many of the services provided by our security resources are coordinated through our GSOC based out of our Global Headquarters in the U.S. in Allentown, Pennsylvania. Other regional security operations centers were recently established in Santiago, Chile and Dammam, Saudi Arabia. Employee Health and Wellness We are committed to creating work environments and driving behaviors that sustain the health, safety, and wellness of our people. Our Global Health and Wellness Team, consisting of medical professionals globally, works closely with our Human Resources and EHS organizations. Since early in the pandemic, this Team has been focused on responding to COVID-19 and supporting Air Products’ Crisis Management Teams globally. The Team supported the development of COVID-19 standards for PPE and other safety protections, and working with our Procurement Team, ensured that necessary PPE was available to employees. In many cases, the Company’s COVID-19 standards exceeded local standards, such as mask specifications and wearing masks, deep cleaning protocols and social distancing, from the start of the pandemic. While addressing COVID-19, our Global Health and Wellness Team continued to roll out other initiatives, including a driver sleep apnea program in North America. This voluntary program helps company drivers determine if they have sleep apnea and then assists them in obtaining treatment and equipment as needed. Likewise, the Team supported efforts to help employees improve the ergonomics of their workstations, particularly as many were working from home. Our Products Promote Health and Well-Being For over 80 years, we’ve supplied medical grade gases, equipment, turnkey services, and cryogenic services for MRIs at hospitals and institutions globally. Our medical gases are used in secondary care centers, surgical centers, extended care facilities, research laboratories, at home, and in stand-alone MRI imaging centers. Supporting employee health in the Middle East Air Products is committed to the safety and health of our employees globally. As we grow in the Middle East, so have our health and wellness programs for employees. For example, in NEOM we are prioritizing employee health and wellness by ensuring remote medical infrastructure is in place to offer primary healthcare and emergency services. This is being accomplished by assessing needs for medical care and facilities, evaluating the capabilities of these facilities, defining medical coverage and approved healthcare providers, and defining a medical emergency response plan that can be integrated within the overall NEOM community plan. Moreover, we are striving for a proactive, holistic approach that supports the occupational health and wellness of our workforce, which is supported by our programs, regional healthcare network, and collaborations with our partners on our health and well-being vision.

At Air Prod- ucts, our talented, diverse, and mo- tivated team of people in more than 50 countries help us fulfill our higher purpose to develop innovative solu- tions to the world’s most significant energy and environmental challenges. Our employees work with custom- ers to effectively execute world-scale megaprojects to produce and deliver the products that make a difference in people’s lives around the world. We continue to provide challenging opportunities for our employees to grow and expand their capabilities and impact on our business, enabling us to sustain our leadership position in the market. What We’re Doing It is part of our higher purpose to create a work environment where every employee knows they belong and matter, to create a first-class company where employees enjoy coming to work and are proud of what they do. To do this, we have enhanced our way of leading to reflect the needs of our business and our employees today and into the future. The introduction of our new leadership model defines the capabilities and values required of our leaders to address global and regional strategic priorities. It shows our leaders how to sh ape our culture to enable the achievement of our goals and higher purpose. We work every day to continue to build a culture that empowers and motivates employees. We continuously strive to create a culture where employees enjoy coming to work and are proud of their contributions. In 2021, we continued this commitment and expanded our workforce by almost 2,000 employees, growing to more than 20,000 globally. Through that growth we increased the percentage of U.S. minorities in professional and managerial roles and expand- ed our efforts to increase the percentage of women in these same roles around the world. We took steps to embed our Diversity, Inclusion and Belonging (DIB) framework throughout the organization and to evolve our diversity conversations through companywide events, such as our annual Week of Inclusion. We continue to grow our leadership capabilities to reflect the impor- tance of diversity, inclusion and belonging as a cornerstone of our company culture. We have expanded innovative employee benefit programs, such as our Legal Advocacy Program, which supports employees and their family members when facing discrimination outside the workplace. Initially launched in the U.S. and Canada, the program is now also available to employees in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, the United Arab Emirates, Oman and Egypt. Our Talent Management processes, DIB strategy and Total Rewards offerings are centered on attracting, building, and retaining a world-class and highly skilled workforce, capable of delivering our growth ambitions and excellent service to our customers. Talent and Diversity “ “ I truly believe that the only element of long-term competitive advantage is the degree of commitment and motivation of the people in the enterprise.

      "Air Products | 2022 Sustainability Report Our Commitment and Contributions Our continued leadership in competitive markets and achieving our higher purpose requires setting transparent, measurable diversity goals. In 2020, we announced new goals to increase the percentage of women and U.S. minorities in professional and managerial roles at the company by 2025. One year later, we demonstrated substantial success, surpassing our target and increasing the percentage of U.S. minorities in our professional and managerial population from a baseline of 17 percent to 22 percent. Based on that success, we set a new and more aggressive target of reaching 30 percent minority representation in these U.S. roles by 2025. Additionally, we remain committed to our goal of achieving at least 28 percent female representation in the professional and managerial population globally by 2025. In 2021 the number of women in professional and managerial positions at Air Products was up slightly to 26 percent. With a broad operating scope and more than 20,000 employees in over 50 countries, we established these targets following analysis of our global employee representation, future talent needs and by assessing industry benchmarks and peer companies. Setting these goals provided our organization with an increased focus on diverse talent. Our diversity targets coupled with the ongoing growth of our employee population enabled us to make significant progress in a short period of time. Our continued public commitment to create the world’s most diverse industrial gas workforce makes Air Products an attractive choice to prospective employees. We strive to grow our global population of women in professional and managerial roles even as some of our worldwide locations traditionally have smaller female applicant pools. In response, we are driving growth in our female population around the globe through expanded training, internships, and apprenticeships, such as our Female Engineer and Technical Apprentices (FETA) program in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. We also partner with educational institutions to expand opportunities for women studying in fields traditionally held by male populations.

By fully utilizing the diversity of the talent pools, and fostering a respec- tive and inclusive culture, employees feel empowered to seek out diverse perspectives, and confidently express their viewpoint, creating meaning- ful change in support of our higher purpose. Diversity in the Workplace Our diversity in the workplace continues to see positive trends as we increased the percentage of women and U.S. minorities in our workforce, management and senior leadership. In fact in 2021, we met our 2025 goal of boosting the percentage of U.S. minorities in our professional and managerial population from 17 percent to 22 percent and set a new goal of 30 percent to be reached in the same timeframe. We continue to engage with diversity partners to support talent and development within our organization. In 2021, Air Products was once again recognized for strong performance in Diversity and Inclusion, earning a perfect 100 percent score on the Human Rights Campaign Foundation’s 2021 Corporate Equality Index for the fifth consecutive year. Talent and Diversity Human Capital Resources At the end of FY21, Air Products had over 20,000 employees worldwide of which over 15,000 were based outside of the U.S. Most employees had full-time and permanent work arrangements, and 18 percent were members of collective bargaining units. We are committed to an organizational culture that values diversity, inclusion and belonging, and have set goals to increase the diversity of our workforce. Our talent management and workforce planning programs are focused on employee attraction, development, and retention, providing numerous training opportunities to cultivate talent.

Employees choose learning and development goals aligned to roles and respon- sibilities that support current and future business needs. We continue to invest in new learning platforms and learner-centric experiences that encourage employee development and skills retention. Our people competencies are aligned with our “4S” culture of Safety, Speed, Simplicity, and Self-Confidence. Every employee focuses on mastering our core competencies and receives an annual coaching conversation to drive his or her development. Through- out the year, we use performance management, coaching, continuous conversations, and targeted training to help our employees grow in their careers. Talent Attraction and Management In 2021, Air Products increased our employee population to respond to our growing business needs, specifically the need to increase the number of employees in highly skilled positions to execute on our many megaprojects around the world. Through intentional workforce planning, we ensure existing and new employees possess the skills and capabilities our business needs to deliver now and in the future. Talent management goes beyond investing in our current workforce. It in- cludes building and executing a competitive talent attraction strategy. We use innovative recruiting strategies and have long-standing partnerships with di- versity recruiting organizations to strengthen our available pipeline of world- class diverse talent. In 2021, 38 percent of our college hires were women and 45 percent were U.S. minorities. Attracting, recruiting, sourcing and securing new and diverse talent is instrumental in building our workforce for the future. In a competitive market, our onboarding programs ensure we bring new talent into the company as part of a year-long acclimation and learning journey. These efforts were even more important throughout the Covid-19 pandemic and now with an increasingly competitive marketplace. Faced with these challenges, our efforts to build a workplace culture where every employee knows they belong and matter helped our company to continue to attract talent and to grow during 2021, with turnover remaining below industry benchmarks. We continue to invest in our current talent through our Talent and Perfor- mance Development process. These efforts identify opportunities to upskill, reskill and build competencies through on-the-job development and formal training. Retaining our employees is important to Air Products, including those with critical capabilities and skills. For these reasons, we provide a competi- tive total rewards package. We also purposefully create a culture of care, where employees feel valued and know they belong and matter. Talent and Diversity Safety Safety is a moral responsibility. The only acceptable goal is zero accidents. Speed We will act with urgency and respond quickly to our customers’ needs.

      "Air Products | 2022 Sustainability Report Growing Our Understanding . . . A Week of Inclusion Air Products hosted a Day of Understanding as part of its Week of Inclusion in which employees participated in a series of discussions on diversity, inclusion and belonging. For several years, The Day of Understanding has been held as part of Air Products’ commitment to CEO Action for Diversity and Inclusion. Seifi Ghasemi, Air Products’ Chairman, President and CEO, is one of nearly 2,000 leaders through this initiative who pledged to take action to support a more inclusive workplace. As part of the Day of Understanding, leaders throughout the Company took part and led conversations about inclusion and addressed potential bias in the workplace. In 2021, Air Products expanded its Day of Understanding efforts to include a week of global activities and discussions under the theme of “Allyship and Advocacy.” Allyship is when any person takes or demonstrates action to support, empower or stand up for another person or group of people. Allyship is a key part of the Company’s goal to create a workplace where all employees know they belong and matter. The week included a fireside chat with Ghasemi and Victoria Brifo, Air Products’ Senior Vice President and Chief Human Resources Officer. During the chat, they shared their view on why building an inclusive workplace is the right thing to do and a competitive advantage for the Company. “When you look at Air Products, we operate not in isolation, we are part of the society we live in. If we are going to be an integral part of the ecosystem, it is only natural that our workforce should be representative of that society,” Ghasemi said. “When you have a diverse group of people, your probability of being innovative significantly increases.” In addition to the fireside chat, employees had the opportunity to take part in numerous discussions and events, including sessions such as “We Stand Together – Supporting Our Employees Inside and Outside the Workplace,” and “Allyship Across Races: No Comfort Zones.” Examples of Our External Diversity Partners: • Catalyst • Out and Equal • National Action Council on Minorities in En- gineering (NACME) • National Society of Black Engineers (NSBE) • Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers (SHPE) • Society of Women Engineers (SWE) • Women in Science and Engineering (WISE) #YouBelongAndMatter Strategy Customers Environment Climate Employees Communities Appendix 42\n",

In 2021, a member of the Middle East Employee Resource Group, reached out to a U.S.-based colleague in the Women’s Success Network (WSN) seeking mentorship opportunities for female Air Products’ employees based in the Middle East. The result – 12 women in the Middle East, with roles ranging from administrative assistants to engineers, were paired with a U.S.- based colleague to talk, share work experiences, and discuss challenges they may face. Lisa Shober, co-chair of WSN, said many of the women in the Middle East were early on in their Air Products’ careers with one to four years of experience, so the mentorship program provided a great opportunity for one-on-one interaction with more experienced colleagues. The program started in October 2021, with participants meeting virtually every four-to-six weeks. “Those taking part are very outgoing, very ambitious and want to reach outside of their scope and learn more,” Shober said, adding the program will continue for at least one year. Employee Resource Groups The diversity of our employees is a source of strength for the company. And our strength and diversity continued to grow in 2021 with the expansion of a number of Air Products’ Employee Resource Groups (ERGs). Air Products now has 12 ERGs and 24 total ERG chapters around the world. These ERGs form an Inclusion Network that partners with our Company’s leadership to create supportive communities that raise cultural awareness, attract and retain talent, and serve as a think tank for people development and problem solving. Our network of ERGs enables the Company to better understand different cultures and connect with customers around the world. For our employees, the groups provide linkages and build affinity between broader groups of employees and enable exposure to different career paths. Throughout the year, the Inclusion Network and ERGs sponsored activities and programs for all employees including workshops, panel discussions, awareness training and professional development sessions. In 2021, two new ERGs, Fulcrum and NextGen, were launched.

Collaboration also builds trust, which is fundamental to the continued growth and operation of companies through giving back to the communities where employees live and work. What We’re Doing For over 80 years, Air Products has been building relationships and con- tributing to the well-being of our host communities around the world. We do this in a variety of ways: through financial contributions from the Air Products Foundation, in-kind do- nations, employee directed giving, and employee volunteerism with non-profit organizations. Our support priorities include education and workforce development, diversity and inclusion, health and human services, community and economic development, arts and culture and environment and safety. We work closely with community partners, including non-profit organizations, emergency responders, elected officials, and education, business, and community leaders to identify the highest impact opportunities. In 2021, our efforts continued to focus on the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, providing community support in the wake of the Delta and Omicron variants, making much-needed deliveries of medical oxygen and helium to hospitals, providing the infrastructure needed for emergency pop-up hospitals, as well as making other donations for medical care. In addition to our COVID-19 efforts, we continued to provide significant grants to support basic needs for the unsheltered, hungry, and unemployed, particularly in urban areas. We connected our employees to non-profits, virtually, to provide mentoring and advice regarding business processes related to accounting, finance, human resources and more. The Air Products Foundation The mission of the Air Products Foundation is to build meaningful relationships with charitable organizations that share the values inherent in our higher purpose and to enhance positive relationships with Air Products’ employees, communities, customers, and shareholders. Using its mission as a guide, the Air Products Foundation supports programs in our host communities throughout the U.S., in global locations where we have employees and operations, at colleges and universities where we are strategically engaged, in national organizations committed to diversity and inclusion, and through employee- and retiree-directed matching gifts programs. Our Commitments and Contributions In fiscal 2021, the Air Products Foundation made $7 million in cash contributions including grants to organizations near our headquarters, throughout the U.S. and international communities. International giving increased by 40 percent in 2021. These grants reinforced our community outreach plans, responded to community needs, and supported eligible non-profits, particularly through matching gifts. Totaling $2.4 million, the matching gift portion of the donations was distributed based on employee and retiree giving, thereby reflecting the organizations most important to our people.

In 2021, Air Products’ director of Community Relations and Philanthropy, Laurie Gostley Hackett, chaired the regional 2021 campaign for United Way. With the strong support of Air Products, she stepped into the role with great optimism and enthusiasm, and recognition of how much our communities had been through over the past year. The campaign raised funds to meet the community’s emerging needs while investing in sustainable solutions to challenges in the areas of education, emergency services, food access and healthy aging.

      "Air Products | 2022 Sustainability Report Thousands of suppliers are essential to our success. We work with quality suppliers who help Air Products deliver value and excellent service to our customers and who share our commitment to ethical business practices. All suppliers are expected to abide by and conform to our Code of Conduct in their business dealings with us and to support sustainability through the principles outlined in our Sustainability Expectations of Suppliers, which include environmental, human rights and community considerations. In total, Air Products spent almost $8 billion on energy, equipment, materials, and services with over 31,000 unique suppliers and service providers in 2021. Energy is the primary raw material purchased to manufacture industrial gases, particularly electricity and steam for our ASUs, and natural gas for our HyCO plants. Steel, aluminum, and capital equipment subcomponents are the primary materials procured for our equipment business. There were no significant changes in our supply chain year-over-year. Because Air Products operates regionally, our procurement teams are primarily local to our businesses and work with regional and local suppliers. In addition, our corporate team supports procurement of capital equipment to construct large industrial gas production facilities and other global projects. The supplier qualification process is a combination of prequalification and ongoing monitoring. New suppliers are qualified using criteria including commercial risk, safety, performance, and sustainability. If noncompliance is identified for an existing supplier through ongoing monitoring, our procurement teams work with the supplier to take proper corrective actions and rectify the issue. Supply Chain Sustainability Supplier Diversity It is our policy and practice to provide maximum practical opportunities to diverse suppliers. In 2021, approxi- mately 20 percent of our procurement in the U.S. was from diverse suppliers, including small, socially and eco- nomically disadvantaged, and other minority-owned and women-owned U.S. businesses that can provide competitive sources of materials and services. We offer advice and guidance to assist minority business firms in building relationships and becoming successful suppliers to us. Human Rights and Conflict Minerals We complete annual human rights assessments for our operations and supply chains. From a supply chain perspective, we examined human rights risks relative to procurement spend and supplier location using country- specific risk information from third parties. Most of our suppliers are in heavy industries that are not as susceptible to human rights violations as other industries. No significant risks were identified through our assessment, and we are not aware of any allegations of violations of human rights in our supply chain in 2021. As a U.S. company, Air Products must ensure it does not transact with prohib- ited and sanctioned companies and countries. The Company uses a screening tool to vet its vendors and customers, which includes daily updates of prohibi- tions and sanctions lists. The tool is tied into Air Products’ enterprise resource planning process (SAP) and automatically blocks transactions with companies engaged in forced labor as well as sanctioned parties. In addition, Air Products specifically evaluates our supply chain for the pres- ence of conflict minerals. The Conflict Minerals Rule under the Dodd Frank Act requires companies to perform and disclose due diligence on the source of minerals within its supply chain including tantalum, tin, gold, and tungsten. The purpose of this regulation is to ensure that the purchase of those materials does not support armed conflict and the associated emergency humanitarian crisis in the Democratic Republic of Congo. In response to customer requests, Air Products expanded its supply chain evaluation to include cobalt and mica. To address the issue of conflict miner- als, Air Products includes conflict minerals clauses in our standard contractual terms and conditions. We also comply with the Dodd Frank Act through the annual disclosure of our Conflict Minerals Report. Strategy Customers Environment Climate Employees Communities Appendix 49\n",
      "Air Products | 2022 Sustainability Report Stakeholder Engagement We work closely with our key stakeholders – customers, employees, investors, communities, suppliers, and government regulators – to understand and respond to their needs and collaborate for shared benefit. Meetings, presentations, and ongoing dialogue with stakeholders throughout the year provide many opportunities for collaboration on sustainability. Stakeholder Assessment Air Products has been conducting stakeholder assessments since it began reporting in accordance with GRI guidelines. Stakeholder assessments have included: • Evaluating sustainability issues identified in various frameworks, standards, questionnaires, customer, and other company reports and stakeholder questions • Interviewing and/or surveying key stakeholders to understand their sustainability concerns and priorities • Reviewing the results with our Sustainability Leadership Council to confirm the priorities and further shape our sustainability efforts Topics for stakeholder assessments were taken from many sources, including the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB), TCFD, and CDP (see next page). Stakeholders reflected on these concerns and provided their feedback on the importance and potential impacts of the issues. The concerns rated by the stakeholders with the highest level of importance and impact are included in our Sustainability Priorities and frame our sustainability reporting. The priorities for this Report have been updated slightly and at the direction of our Sustainability Leadership Council to specifically include CO2 within the energy and climate priority.

      "Air Products | 2022 Sustainability Report About Our Report Air Products has reported on its sustainability performance annually for the past 19 years, building on previous decades of environmental, health and safety disclosures and reporting. This is our 13th consecutive year reporting in accordance with GRI, which we believe is the most encompassing reporting standard for the sustainability aspects we consider. We also provide on our Sustainability Report webpage summaries of how our sustainability efforts are aligned with the reporting recommendations of SASB and TCFD. Air Products has been tracking developments of emerging sustainability and climate change reporting requirements, such as the U.S. Security and Exchange Commission’s (SEC’s) proposed rule on Climate Disclosures. The Company has a foundation for compliance with the new requirements when they come into force, having reported on sustainability matters for nearly thirty years, and carbon emissions for over a decade. In addition, the SEC’s proposed rule is aligned with recommendations of the TCFD, which Air Products has published information on for several years. This Report has been prepared in accordance with the GRI standards “Core option.” The Core option is aimed at providing stakeholders with data and perspectives to understand and evaluate our performance, impacts and opportunities. This Report also contains supplemental information not specified by GRI that illustrates additional aspects of our sustainability efforts and impacts. Air Products used GRI’s Principles for Defining Report Content to develop this Report.

MESSAGE FROM CEO MESSAGE FROM CT&DO OUR VISION AWARDS TIMELINE MESSAGE FROM CHUCK MAGRO, CEO Corteva Agriscience is guided by a simple but powerful purpose: to enrich the lives of those who produce and those who consume, ensuring progress for generations to come. In a world that demands urgent action, Corteva will deliver on its purpose by being the leader in innovative, sustainable solutions for farmers worldwide, today and tomorrow...to become the world’s most valuable agriculture solutions company. Corteva colleagues around the world are working to support the resilience of our global food production system—advancing economic, environmental and social sustainability through proven science. They have a passion to improve the lives of farmers, consumers and communities. It isn’t maintaining the status quo. It’s about improving and continuing to evolve. We believe climate positive agriculture is the way forward, where our collective actions and commitments create a stronger and more productive food system. We employ the power of innovation to develop sustainable seed and crop protection products for farmers. At the same time, we embrace new technologies and practices that reduce greenhouse gas emissions and impacts on biodiversity. We recognize this is a journey that requires continued focus on delivering technologies that contribute to a resilient and sustainable global food system. Through efforts in each area, we believe Corteva can bring lasting change and improvement to the natural resources, communities and people who make farming possible. With the right focus, the right actions and people passionately committed to helping farmers and the planet, we are confident we can be a major force for sustainable agriculture around the world. This report is an up-close view of the work we have embarked upon and how it aligns with our mission and values. We look forward to this new phase in our sustainability journey. “ Corteva can bring lasting change and improvement to the natural resources, communities and people who make farming possible.” — Chuck Magro Chief Executive Officer Corteva Agriscience This report reflects our continued transparency regarding our environmental, social and governance (ESG) efforts and is an important step forward in our approach to advance sustainable progress for agriculture. The report outlines our intent to focus on four areas we believe are the most urgent and, together, have the greatest potential to create a significant positive impact on the farmers, people, environments and communities we serve: • Sustainable Innovation • Biodiversity • Greenhouse Gas Emissions • Inclusion, Diversity & Equity INTRODUCTION OUR BUSINESS OUR FOCUS ESG DISCLOSURES ESG INDEXES\n",

MESSAGE FROM CEO MESSAGE FROM CT&DO OUR VISION AWARDS TIMELINE You’ll see several examples of such solutions in this report, including: • Plenish® High Oleic Soybeans: a soybean that produces an oil with exceptional stability and improved nutrition suitable for food service and food manufacture applications without the need for hydrogenation – which is traditionally needed to stabilize the oil and leads to trans fat. As a result, this oil has become the industry standard. • Reklemel™ active: a reduced risk crop protection solution that protects crops against nematode damage while preserving the healthy balance of beneficial organisms in the soil (Learn more).4 This report also outlines the next phase of our sustainability work—concentrated efforts on issues that need to be addressed with urgency. We’re narrowing our focus to four critical and interconnected areas—sustainable innovation; biodiversity; greenhouse gas emissions; and inclusion, diversity and equity (“ID&E”)—while continuing to provide transparency by periodically reporting our overall environmental, social and governance (“ESG”) performance. As we strive to address the challenges of our time, we will continue to push the boundaries of innovation to help farmers produce an abundant, affordable and resilient food supply that will help humanity thrive for generations to come. It’s a pivotal time for agriculture. A time to advance transformational change against the backdrop of these global issues: Global food demand continues to grow. The United Nations predicts the world’s population will increase by 2 billion, up to 9.7 billion, by 2050.1 As our population increases, and industrial and economic development advance, the need for food will expand and change, driving pressures to convert more land and habitats to farmland to meet growing demand. Farmers have more threats to their crops. Changes in our climate have shifted weed, insect and disease pressures and increased extreme weather events. The 2021 Global Food Security Index, by Economist Impact, reported that agricultural productivity in more than half of the world’s countries has been negatively impacted by changing rainfall patterns and excessive temperature swings.2 And society expects more from agriculture. Consumers, regulators and food companies want to know where food comes from, how it was produced and that it was produced sustainably. A recent global consumer survey showed that 67 percent of respondents are concerned about the impact of food production on climate change and 79 percent prefer environmentally friendly products.3 What’s the solution? Innovation. The future of food production hinges on getting new, sustainable and productive tools and technologies into the hands of farmers—technology that meets these needs while minimizing negative trade-offs. “ The world’s need for resiliency – and the development of tools to combat the pressures that inhibit the production of that food–is fundamental.” — Sam Eathington Chief Technology and Digital Officer Corteva Agriscience INTRODUCTION OUR BUSINESS OUR FOCUS ESG DISCLOSURES ESG INDEXES\n",
      "6 2021 SUSTAINABILITY & ESG REPORT KEEP GROWING. MESSAGE FROM CEO MESSAGE FROM CT&DO OUR VISION AWARDS TIMELINE OUR VISION We believe farmers are the most important stewards of the land and our natural resources. We also believe that agriculture has the power to transform the environmental, economic and social health of our planet so that we can continue to feed the world while supporting the very resources that make it all possible. Agricultural technologies can help farmers produce more food while reducing environmental impact, creating more land-use choices for farmers and communities. These fundamental beliefs drive our approach to embed sustainability into our business. From our seed and crop protection products to our inclusion, diversity and equity (“ID&E”) efforts, we work to put everything we do through the filter of good for farmers, good for the planet and good for people. The challenges we face today as a society are significant. However, we believe agriculture plays a vital role in providing viable solutions—and we know the pathway to climate positive agriculture is through a systems approach. We look forward to engaging with our stakeholders on our ESG priorities and practices. Growing global pressures continue to highlight the fragility of world food supply. By focusing on these four critical areas, we can harness our best science and lead meaningful, measurable efforts to support agricultural production—for food, fuel and fiber—as the world continues to undergo tremendous disruption. We continue to learn throughout this journey and use our voice, innovation and scale to contribute to positive and lasting change. As we evolve our approach, we remain steadfast in our commitment to advancing sustainable agriculture to enable food security and production and enrich lives and our planet for generations to come. WE ARE EVOLVING OUR FOCUS TO FOUR CRITICAL AREAS THAT URGENTLY NEED SOLVING: SUSTAINABLE INNOVATION: Innovative solutions will allow farmers to increase productivity and profitability potential, provide climate solutions and improve resilience to mounting weed, insect, disease and weather pressures. BIODIVERSITY: Efforts to reduce impacts through agronomic best practices and investment in preventing future land-use change in sensitive areas to support ecological balance, agricultural productivity, climate resilience and right to operate. GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS (“GHG”): Science-driven action to address climate change is urgent. Corteva Agriscience is committed to taking steps to reduce our GHG footprint. ID&E: To deliver innovative, sustainable solutions while advancing equity in agriculture, we must attract and retain the best talent from a variety of backgrounds, worldviews and life circumstances and enable a culture of belonging in which every member of the Corteva community feels valued and appreciated.

It’s an essential part of food production and healthy ecosystems. Farmers have long understood its importance. Changes in biodiversity below the ground, on the farm and around it can impact yield, productivity, income and revenues for farmers and businesses throughout the food production value chain. That’s why Corteva Agriscience has prioritized efforts to identify where we can advance biodiversity in a meaningful way—by advancing products that support biodiversity, reducing the need for land-use change, enable soil biodiversity and identifying opportunities to protect pollinator habitats. Work in these areas can, in turn, support crop pollination, climate regulation, healthy soil function and freshwater availability. Increasing agricultural production to meet the demands of the world’s growing population is expected to continue. This could increase the need to bring more land into food production and threaten biodiversity, but it doesn’t have to. That's why we’re intending to amplify our efforts to help farmers produce more food on every acre and potentially reduce the need for land-use changes. We are committed to partnering to address biodiversity challenges related to land use change where Corteva can make a difference. We are taking steps to map priority areas for collaboration.

Sustainability, ethics and ID&E matters are supported by teams that make recommendations to our executive management and the Board and its Committees, as applicable, to gain alignment on sustainability strategy and performance, including climate-related matters, and drive implementation of Corteva’s sustainability initiatives. At Corteva, sustainability matters are assessed and managed across all businesses on a regular basis as an integral part of business operations and strategy. Accountability for business and sustainability results extend company wide. Following an evaluation in 2021, an ESG modifier was incorporated into the Company’s 2022 short-term incentive program for executives, including a focus on increasing year-over-year sales of sustainable crop protection products and progress on the Company’s ID&E initiatives. All employees have sustainability as a performance goal category for annual performance assessments. Across the business, key individuals who are responsible for sustainability initiatives including climate-related initiatives may have annual performance goals tied to the delivery of projects related to these initiatives. Our commitment to sustainability and corporate responsibility is integrated into our business through our purpose, values, governance structures and business model. Our sustainability management processes are designed to keep the organization informed about significant economic, environmental and social sustainability issues affecting the company. This reflects the focus of our leadership team and Board of Directors on ensuring that Corteva consistently advances the future of agriculture. CLIMATE The S&I Committee’s charter explicitly designates committee responsibility for oversight of climate-related risks and opportunities, with the responsibility to review and monitor the Company’s climate change risks, plans, goals and targets, as well as its progress against such goals and targets, annually on behalf of the Board. 1.

SUSTAINABILITY AND ESG GOVERNANCE ENVIRONMENT SOCIAL SUSTAINABILITY AND ESG GOVERNANCE ESG DISCLOSURES At Corteva, climate-related risks and opportunities are assessed and managed across all businesses on a regular basis. Management regularly assesses and manages climate related issues as risks and as strategic opportunities for innovation and operational efficiency. One example is the opportunity for existing and new products and service offerings to meet the anticipated demands of climate-smart agriculture that improves productivity and mitigates the impact of more extreme and volatile weather. Climate-related management spans multiple functions across Corteva, including Corteva’s R&D, operations and others. R&D considers long- term climate change impacts and opportunities in the development of the next generation of products. Manufacturing operations monitor, manage and respond to short-term and medium- term climate-related impacts and opportunities, and others. INCLUSION, DIVERSITY & EQUITY (ID&E) Embracing ID&E starts with our Board including the People and Compensation Committee, which is regularly monitoring our progress and helps guide and direct our efforts. Our Executive Leadership Team also fully supports this commitment, and our CEO, Chuck Magro, reaffirmed its importance by making ID&E a key component of the business priorities he’s established for our organization. INFORMATION SECURITY & PRIVACY Corteva Agriscience has a robust information security training and compliance program annually, which includes components such as phishing, logical access and general cybersecurity awareness. Corteva’s Chief Information Security Officer reports to the Audit Committee on information security matters at least annually. In addition, the company is externally audited against top information security and compliance standards using a financial reporting risk-based approach, with complete corporate scope. Corteva’s security policies are derived from globally recognized National Institute of Standards and Technology standards. Corteva also has a robust privacy program that is part of the Corteva Risk and Compliance function. The program is overseen by the Global Chief Privacy Officer and includes a staff of privacy professionals and designated leaders across operational and business functions, each with specific responsibility and accountability for data privacy management. A comprehensive privacy report is provided to the Ethics and Compliance committee annually with interim reports on a quarterly basis. Like most major corporations, Corteva is the target of industrial espionage, including cyber- attacks, from time to time. Corteva has determined that these incidents have resulted, and could result in the future, in unauthorized parties gaining access to certain confidential business information. However, to date, Corteva has not experienced any material financial impact, changes in its competitive environment or impact on business operations from these events. Although management does not believe that Corteva has experienced any material losses to date related to industrial espionage and security breaches, including cybersecurity incidents, there can be no assurance that Corteva will not suffer such losses in the future. Corteva has had no substantiated complaints received from a regulator or outside party related to a Corteva breach in 2021, as that term is defined by applicable law. Corteva does not categorize events as “leaks, thefts or losses of customer data” and so we are unable to provide reporting for those requested categories. SUPPLY CHAIN RESPONSIBILITY Suppliers are required to agree or attest to our Supplier Code of Conduct within their contract terms, including acknowledging our zero tolerance policy on human rights violations. While Corteva has an important role to play in these issues, risks may occur within the supply chain. Corteva, together with its worldwide subsidiaries and joint ventures, requires that all of its global vendors, contractors and suppliers of any product or raw material, wherever it originates, apply its Human Trafficking, Child Labor and Forced Labor Principles. The Supplier Code of Conduct and Human Trafficking, Child Labor and Forced Labor Principles expressly outline zero tolerance on these issues, and if a company is in violation of said principles, the contract would ultimately be terminated. Additionally, it is the responsibility of local management to implement and ensure compliance with these Principles at Corteva facilities in each region around the world. In addition, the Supplier Code of Conduct outlines expectations for environmental partnership, including systems and reporting. Our work with suppliers is supported by our membership in Together for Sustainability (“TfS”) and the tools they offer to chemical companies and their suppliers, such as frameworks, TfS assessments and social and environmental TfS audits. Today, there are certain additional documented processes beyond the Supplier Code of Conduct in place to consider factors such as environmental management, health and safety in screening new suppliers or partners. The Supplier Code of Conduct states that we will choose to work with partners who seek to implement sustainable production processes and who proactively minimize the environmental impact of their operations. Additional details regarding diversity and sustainability expectations for our suppliers can be found on the Supplier Sustainability and Diversity website and in the Supplier Code of Conduct.

SUSTAINABILITY AND ESG GOVERNANCE ENVIRONMENT SOCIAL SUSTAINABILITY AND ESG GOVERNANCE ESG DISCLOSURES EXTERNAL INITIATIVES, MEMBERSHIPS AND PARTNERSHIPS Corteva is involved in memberships, sponsorships and partnerships advancing sustainability efforts globally. Memberships, sponsorships and partnerships are critical to driving collective action on the global challenges facing agriculture and are an important channel for stakeholder feedback. Corteva endeavors to take an active participatory role through its involvements. Examples include: United Nations Sustainable Development Goals Corteva supports advancing progress towards the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (“UN SDGs”) by aligning our sustainable innovation pipeline with UN SDGs 2, 6, 12, 13, and 15. In addition, Corteva has aligned its focus areas and non-financial materiality assessment1 to at least one particular UN SDG. United Nations Global Compact Corteva supports the ten principles of the UN Global Compact. The UN Global Compact is the largest international sustainability initiative, supporting companies to: (1) do business responsibly by aligning their strategies and operations with ten principles on human rights, labor, environment, and anti-corruption; and (2) take strategic actions to advance broader societal goals, such as the UN Sustainable Development Goals, with an emphasis on collaboration and innovation. See Corteva’s Communication on Progress (CoP). Precautionary Approach/UN Global Compact Principle 7 Corteva applies the Precautionary Approach advocated by UN Global Compact Principle 7. Consistent with the interpretation of many countries and organizations, Corteva interprets the UN’s Precautionary Approach as a regulatory best practice and not as anti- technology. Corteva follows the precautionary principle by applying its classic definition: taking measures to “do no harm.” We take appropriate actions to prevent harm through a rigorous scientific approach and follow regulatory best practices and requirements when we bring new products to market. We diligently assess and employ safety measures to manage environmental, health and safety risks. In addition, we conduct risk assessments as we bring new technologies to market and employ industry-leading tools, such as our Predictive Safety Center, to design with relevant factors in mind. There is some uncertainty in that risk assessment, so safety measures are put in place. See Product Stewardship in this section for additional details on these measures. Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (“SASB”) We follow the approach of SASB, beginning with drawing on SASB material topics as part of a non-financial materiality assessment1 development, and now by including a SASB reference as part of our inaugural sustainability report. Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (“TCFD”) As part of our continuing science-based journey, we are sharing progress in line with TCFD guidelines on governance, strategy, risk management and target setting for climate-related risks and opportunities. Science Based Targets Initiative (“SBTi”) SBTi is a partnership between CDP, the United Nations Global Compact, World Resources Institute (“WRI”) and the World Wildlife Fund (“WWF”). SBTi drives ambitious climate action in the private sector by enabling companies to set science-based emissions reduction targets. Corteva has committed to setting Science Based Targets for greenhouse gas emissions reductions. Since our last report, we have started the process of validating near-term GHG emission reduction options with the Science-Based Targets initiative (“SBTi”). Responsible Care Program Responsible Care® is the chemical manufacturing industry’s environmental, health, safety and security performance initiative. For more than 30 years, Responsible Care has helped American Chemistry Council member companies, like Corteva, significantly enhance their performance and improve the health and safety of their employees, the communities in which they operate and the environment. Together for Sustainability (“TfS”) Corteva is a member of TfS, a global, procurement-initiative that delivers, delivers a framework with tools such as TfS Assessments and TfS Audits to assess and improve the sustainable performance of chemical companies and their suppliers. TfS has extended its program now including scope 3 GHG emissions. TfS delivers the de facto global standard for environmental, social and governance performance of the chemical supply chains. The program is based on the UN Global Compact and Responsible Care® principles. 1. The non-financial materiality assessment identifies sustainability topics of relative importance or that are considered signif- icant to internal and external stakeholders but is not aligned to any definition of materiality as outlined in securities law, the Occupational Safety and Health Act, or any other federal, state, local or foreign law, rule, or regulation.

ACRC stewardship of containers does not end with collection. To ensure that the collected plastic is handled safely during processing and used only for end uses that have minimal contact with humans, the ACRC audits all processing and end use manufacturing facilities for compliance with all applicable health, safety and environmental regulations. World Business Council for Sustainable Development (“WBCSD”) Corteva is a member of the WBCSD, a global, CEO-led organization of over 200 leading businesses working together to accelerate the transition to a sustainable world. The organization focuses on the maximum positive impact for shareholders, the environment and societies. As a member, Corteva colleagues actively participates and provides technical expertise to working groups and initiatives as part of the WBCSD. ENGAGEMENT WITH STAKEHOLDERS Stakeholder engagement is an essential element of our sustainability and ESG strategy. Corteva believes that companies contribute to sustainable growth efforts by engaging in regular, open dialogue with stakeholders about community and company issues and working together to solve problems. We value the perspectives and insights of a wide range of stakeholders who have a stake in stewarding the future, including employees, suppliers, customers, stockholders, peer companies in the value chain, nonprofits, communities, government bodies, scientists and trade associations. Corteva regularly meets or engages with these stakeholders including our stockholders in a variety of ways throughout the year. Discussion about engagement efforts with stockholders can be found in our Proxy Statement. Understanding the needs and interests of our stakeholders has been crucial to focus our strategy, identify priorities and target activity where we can have the most positive impact. We have engaged stakeholders in our non-financial materiality assessment,1 and stakeholder feedback was incorporated into our planning and is reflected in this report. This engagement remains equally crucial as we monitor and report on progress. Collaboration will be necessary to achieve measurable progress on social and environmental topics. We can achieve more when we work together and when we start with those who already have a stake in stewarding our future. Stakeholder engagement can take many forms, including but not limited to education and information sharing, innovation and collaboration, consultation, incentivization, compliance, onboarding and information collection. We are committed to continuing to engage stakeholders through our Enriching Lives Together Sustainability Strategy, consistent with our purpose and values. Our engagement with stakeholders is guided by our Privacy Statement, which describes our practices in connection with information that we collect. Our Code of Conduct sets out the standards expected from all our employees when engaging with outside stakeholders and one another. We expect our employees to carry out business activities ethically and in compliance with applicable laws. 1.

      "32 2021 SUSTAINABILITY & ESG REPORT KEEP GROWING. SUSTAINABILITY AND ESG GOVERNANCE ENVIRONMENT SOCIAL In 2019, Corteva designed and implemented its own company-wide global environmental management system (“GEST”) to track environmental metrics, as the DowDuPont1 environmental metrics, goals, and data management systems were not designed to capture or extract information specifically related to the agriculture business as it now exists following its separation from DowDuPont. GEST includes the necessary inputs for environmental parameters relevant to the effective management and monitoring of operations as well as climate-related risks and opportunities. This system is consistent with Responsible Care® standards as well as other globally accepted standards for specific environmental tracking such as the Greenhouse Gas Protocol. Data integrity is governed through a global data management standard. Starting in 2020, Corteva began to collect baseline environmental data from around the world into GEST, to assess and monitor key environmental metrics across Corteva's owned and controlled footprint globally. Unless otherwise stated, the below data covers all sites globally which are reporting into the GEST system, for the full year 2021. Corteva continues to assess calculation adjustments as we look to further understand, adjust and improve our environmental disclosure process, strategy and efforts. CLIMATE RISKS, OPPORTUNITIES & MANAGEMENT Corteva believes that climate change is an important global environmental concern that presents risks and opportunities. In 2021 Corteva initiated an internal qualitative risk and opportunity assessment process to identify climate-related risks and opportunities, which can help to address climate-related risks. This assessment concluded in April 2022.2 Corteva integrates processes for identifying, assessing and managing climate-related risk into its enterprise-wide risk management. We specifically included climate-related risks and opportunities in our monitoring and management processes when Corteva became an independent public company. With oversight by the S&I Committee, and CT&DO, climate-related risks are monitored, managed and mitigated across all business and operational functions on a regular basis. In 2019, Corteva completed its first non-financial materiality assessment3 and developed a global environmental metrics tracking system (“GEST”) to gather data from sites globally related to GHG emissions and other environmental factors related to climate. Such processes enable us to make risk-informed decisions over the short, medium, and long term across all businesses and geographies. Management regularly assesses and manages climate-related issues, as a risk and as a strategic opportunity for innovation and operational efficiency, with delegation of monitoring at multiple levels of the organization. This spans multiple areas across Corteva – including R&D, operations and others. As we consider capital investment, we consider impact on emissions, along with other factors including return on investment. R&D considers long-term climate change impacts and opportunities in the development of the next generation of products. Manufacturing operations monitor, manage and respond to short-term and medium-term climate-related impacts and opportunities. The Sustainability and Innovation Committee provides oversight of the Company’s innovation pipeline and sustainability efforts.

Time Horizon Likelihood of Opportunity Potential Impact to Corteva Velocity of Opportunity Market Demand Upstream 2040 Almost Certain High High < 5 Years What is the opportunity? Corteva continues to advance crop protection offerings, many of which can help to address climate-related challenges. For example, nitrogen fertilizer is a source of on- farm emissions. Corteva continues to focus on nitrogen efficiency by delivering products that promote the retention of nitrogen in the soil and support profitability. There may be further opportunities to increase market demand for products that improve nitrogen efficiency, which reduces emissions while supporting farmer profitability. What is Corteva doing about it? • Corteva and Symborg’s agreement enables the global distribution of microbe-based nitrogen fixation product BlueN™ or Utrisha N™, a unique endophytic bacterium that fixes nitrogen from the air and converts it for plants. The technology provides a sustainable alternative source of nitrogen that reduces dependency on nitrogen uptake from the soil and ensures the plant has access to nitrogen all season long. This nitrogen management solution can help growers maximize yield potential for a broad range of crops, including fruits, vegetables, tree nuts, field and row crops, sugar cane, turf and ornamental, and range and pasture. • Corteva launched PinnitMax® TG, a new above-ground nitrogen stabilizer that helps protect urea and UAN applications from volatilization for up to 14 days, which helps ensure nitrogen gets into the root zone for maximum yield potential. • Corteva’s exclusive Optinyte™ technology found in N-Serve and Instinct reduces denitrification, reducing the escape of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. Conclusions from a meta-analysis were that, on average, use of Optinyte™ technology resulted in a 51% reduction of nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions and a 16% decrease in soil nitrogen leaching. The stabilization of nitrogen resulted in a 7% increase in crop yield by extending nitrogen availability in the soil for up to eight weeks during critical growth stages. Instinct can also be mixed into liquid manure applications, providing a 10-12 bushel per acre yield increase and reduced grain moisture by 1.3% during harvest. Environmental Benefits • Stabilized nitrogen reduces leaching or loss from denitrification • Less nitrate loss in waterways • Reduces emissions of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere Crop Benefits • Nitrogen remains available in the root zone longer for crop uptake • Increased yield in corn (maize), cereals and many other crops • Improves crop quality and plant health https://www.corteva.ca/content/dam/dpagco/corteva/na/ca/en/files/guide/DF-Article-Optinyte-Global-Environoment-Guide.pdf • Read more in Our Focus Areas: Sustainable Innovation to see how Corteva is supporting potential low carbon solutions tied to on-farm emissions, including our work in Green Chemistry.

SUSTAINABILITY AND ESG GOVERNANCE ENVIRONMENT SOCIAL CROP PROTECTION NET REVENUE FROM GREEN CHEMISTRY AWARD WINNERS 2021 CUSTOMER INFORMATION AND LABELING Corteva works to ensure customer access to accurate and adequate information on the positive and negative economic, environmental and social impacts of products and services. Corteva complies with, and in some cases exceeds, the labeling requirements required to register and sell products locally. Corteva uses internal and external review processes to help ensure labeling procedures are followed. Corteva makes labels, safety data sheets and product use guides available online informationally. See U.S. examples for: • Crop Protection Safety Data • Trait Stewardship • Plant Seed Transparency Global equivalents can be found here using the country selector. See more about regulatory considerations driving the requirements for our product safety and labeling in our Annual Report and our Regulatory Data Transparency website. PRODUCT STEWARDSHIP Responsibly managing our products throughout their lifecycle is essential to us, our customers and the public. From concept to end-of-life of products, including training for product use, we employ strong governance and process rigor to accelerate productivity, differentiation and sustainable outcomes through product stewardship. Process rigor extends to each stage of life, from pre-development to development and advancement, to launch of engine to post- launch monitoring, resulting in differentiated efficacy, durability and ability to help sustainably enhance customer productivity. Corteva’s stringent safety standards, as well as those of regulatory bodies around the world, help ensure our products contribute to the delivery of safe and reliable food. They also support efforts to protect the environment. Internally, a unique and proactive approach Corteva takes in this space includes our industry-leading Predictive Safety Center, which helps design crop protection products with environmental factors in mind as part of the product development process. Externally, we are aligned to the FAO International Code of Conduct on Pesticide Management and Excellence Through Stewardship best practices, and follow registrations, labeling and stewardship requirements in accordance with local country-level law. Corteva’s seed products containing biotechnology traits and crop protection products are closely regulated worldwide, with safety reviews and authorizations completed by individual countries. Each new product typically requires that the company seeking approval carry out an extensive set of studies as part of the submission and approval process. Periodic reviews and safety monitoring by regulatory authorities may also be completed. Products must meet or exceed stringent human health and environmental risk assessments for the intended use. Corteva uses externally recognized methods to test our products, including meta-analysis, laboratory and field studies and local on-farm testing. GREEN CHEMISTRY PRINCIPLES FOR CROP PROTECTION Responsibly managing our products throughout their lifecycle is essential to us, our customers and the public. We employ strong governance and process rigor to accelerate productivity, differentiation and sustainable outcomes through product stewardship—from concept to end-of-life products—that includes training for product use. Corteva actively engages in adherence to green chemistry principles aimed at reducing human and environmental impact. These principles are applied across our existing U.S. EPA Green Chemistry Challenge Award winners.

      "44 2021 SUSTAINABILITY & ESG REPORT KEEP GROWING. SUSTAINABILITY AND ESG GOVERNANCE ENVIRONMENT SOCIAL CIRCULAR PACKAGING Corteva takes a circular economy approach to the use of packaging materials which are put on the market, to increase the potential for these packaging materials to be recycled and/or reused over time. Corteva is currently focused on the primary, secondary and tertiary packaging materials for the products that reach our customers. Corteva has a global packaging council and regional packaging steering teams who build sustainable progress into packaging decisions relating to eco-design, rationalization, purchasing and supply across our regions, including ongoing support of ag container recycling and collection schemes globally. REUSABLE A packaging item will be considered as reusable if: • It is designed to be reused; and • There is a business model in place to re-use it. RECYCLABLE A packaging item is recyclable if one of the following criteria is matched: • A recycling stream exists and is used for the material of consideration of the item within our Crop Protection industry; or • The item is made of a material for which a recycling stream outside of our Crop Protection industry exists. In our industry, plastic, cardboard and paper are the dominant materials used to pack final products. Materials that are most often recycled after proper decontamination and for specific and monitored end use include high-density polyethylene (“HDPE”) containers and external cardboard boxes. In 2021, we identified the following opportunities to increase packaging circularity: • Move from multi-material components to mono-material components • Adjust components that can be redesigned without functionality or quality impact to achieve an optimum weight and performance ratio, including introducing a new, redesigned 1 L bottle which is 27% lighter than previous bottles for Corteva's European crop protection products. • Analyze where virgin plastic can be replaced with more sustainable materials. • Use recycled plastic to replace virgin plastic from the crude oil industry. ENVIRONMENT ESG DISCLOSURES LIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENT (“LCAs”) COMPETENCY In early 2020, Corteva established an internal LCA competency. LCA is a science-based, holistic approach to quantifying environmental impacts throughout the value chain of a product or process. LCA is governed by a set of ISO standards. Industry, academia and government agencies have applied LCA for many purposes over the years. The vision and purpose for the LCA competency align with each of Corteva’s Market Shaper behaviors and values. Over the past year, Corteva has used LCA and its methodologies to: √ Provide subject matter expertise and guidance for leadership √ Understand the environmental footprint of select products √ Communicate with key stakeholders Impacts are considered across the full value chain, including raw materials, direct operations, use and end-of-life scenarios. Our internal LCA team will continue to partner with external consultants and stakeholders to provide the analysis and insights needed to achieve targets.

SUSTAINABILITY AND ESG GOVERNANCE ENVIRONMENT SOCIAL SOCIAL ESG DISCLOSURES NON-DISCRIMINATION AND HARASSMENT In addition to the Code of Conduct, Corteva Agriscience internally publishes additional detailed non-discrimination policies outlining expectations that apply to all Corteva employees globally. These policies discuss specific non-discrimination topics, including prohibiting sexual and other types of harassment and reinforcing escalation processes and corrective or disciplinary actions that may result. Employees are required to complete training courses on workplace discrimination and harassment on at least an annual basis (see Employee Training & Development in this section for more information). HUMAN RIGHTS ENFORCEMENT Incidents are reviewed regularly; Corteva discloses incidents to the Board of Directors on at least an annual basis and usually quarterly. In 2021, there were 28 substantiated reportable incidents globally of violations to the Discrimination, Harassment and Retaliation Prevention Policy or the Respect & Responsibility Policy. As result of these cases, 22 involuntary termination actions were taken, and five cases had disciplinary action and/or remediation plans implemented. One case resulted in voluntary resignation prior to Corteva being able to take involuntary termination action. Corteva follows all employee laws by jurisdiction in the countries where we operate, most of which prohibit activities that involve child labor, forced or compulsory labor, violations of the rights of indigenous people or other human rights issues. To enforce these human rights principles in action, Corteva posts signage in physical offices and takes other proactive measures at a local level to convey our zero-tolerance stance on child labor, forced or compulsory behavior, discrimination and other unethical workforce practices. For example, we take a proactive approach to these concerns in India, with certain measures such as community training guided by the UN Universal Declaration of Human Rights, ILO Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work and Indian legal provisions on child labor. These risks may occur in a supply chain. See Supply Chain Responsibility for more information. EMPLOYEE TRAINING & DEVELOPMENT Training and development tools are provided to all employees through third parties and internally developed curricula for compliance, enrichment and upskilling. See more in our 2022 Proxy Statement. Mandatory training for employees covers human rights parameters, including safety, information and personal security, inclusion, ethics, code of conduct, anti-corruption, harassment prevention, well-being and other topics. Each mandatory training has a targeted audience, and many are company-wide requirements (e.g., Vehicle Safety, Harassment Prevention and Code of Conduct), as well as other targeted regional, country business or task-specific audiences (e.g., Antitrust Training and Procurement Procedures). Company-wide requirements are typically focused on the full-time and part-time workforce, whereas some are also required of contractors within the organization (e.g., Information Protection and Vehicle Safety). In addition to training, other benefits such as paid tuition programs are offered. ENVIRONMENT, HEALTH, SAFETY & SECURITY (EHS&S) The Governance and Compliance Committee oversees enterprise EHS&S risks and periodically reviews metrics to track performance and focus improvement efforts. This includes reviewing and providing input to Corteva’s management team regarding the management of current and emerging issues and reporting periodically to the Board of Directors on EHS&S, Distribution Safety & Security (“DS&S”), Quality and Product Regulatory Compliance & Stewardship matters affecting the company. Corteva’s Responsible Enterprise Steering Team regularly reports to the Governance and Compliance Committee of the Board of Directors on EHS&S risk areas, progress and industry trends. The safety of our employees, facilities and the communities where we operate and sell is a priority that is rooted in our Live Safety value and is a core part of how our teams around the world live and work every day. To support farmers and the agriculture industry, we need to ensure that we provide the products they need in a safe and sustainable manner. For Corteva, that means protecting the health and well-being of our employees and their families, as well as our value chain partners and supplemental workforce. We introduced our Live Safely value to demonstrate our commitment to the safety of our people, the communities in which we operate and the environment. It represents Corteva employees’ commitment to safety and our desire to make a difference by the way we live every day. We are working to achieve our safety targets by: • Driving elimination of severe incidents. • Enrolling employees in the Corteva Total Worker Wellbeing (“CTWW”) initiative to control workplace health risks, protect workers and improve the health of all employees. • Implementing a framework to share expertise and information to help drive improved safety performance for our customers and the broader agriculture industry.

The non-financial materiality assessment identifies sustainability topics of relative importance or that are considered significant to internal and external stakeholders but is not aligned to any definition of materiality as outlined in securities law, the Occupational Safety and Health Act, or any other federal, state, local or foreign law, rule or regulation. ABOUT THIS REPORT ADDITIONAL REFERENCES GRI CONTENT INDEX SASB INDEX COP INDEX TCFD INDEX SDG INDEX ADDITIONAL REFERENCES This 2021 Sustainability and ESG Report is Corteva, Inc.’s (\"Corteva\" or \"Corteva Agriscience\" or \"the company\") second annual sustainability report. It serves as an update on the most important social and environmental sustainability topics as identified through Corteva and its external stakeholders’ non-financial materiality assessment,1 conducted in 2019. Corteva sought internal and external stakeholder input to assess the non- financial materiality of relevant environmental and social topics (“sustainability topics”) and publicly disclosed those results. That stakeholder engagement informed the direction of the company’s current sustainability efforts. Corteva’s sustainability topics translate the identified topics into actionable areas where the company can, through its business and practices, drive positive social and environmental progress consistent with the company’s strategic objectives, scope and scale, and through the approach outlined in this report. The following data and information cover the activities of Corteva globally, to the extent possible based on many factors such as enterprise systems or the practicality of capturing data. Where data is not available on a global basis or not provided for a selected entity, it is noted with the data presented. Additional activities related to environmental, social and governance topics that we consider “essential business practices” are discussed within this report where relevant. Corteva engaged accredited 3rd party verifier SGS to complete limited external assurance on specific information within this Sustainability and ESG Report related to certain environmental and social metrics. SGS is the world’s leading inspection, verification, testing and certification company. A separate statement outlining the scope and results from this engagement is provided on our website. Certain additional reported data was compiled, evaluated or verified by third parties such as nonprofit partners. If a restatement is required, it is explained and noted in text and footnotes in the 2021 Sustainability and ESG Report or related data tables. Corteva reports annually in alignment with our fiscal year which ended December 31, 2021. The 2021 Sustainability and ESG Report was published on June 7, 2022.

GRI CONTENT INDEX SASB INDEX COP INDEX TCFD INDEX SDG INDEX ADDITIONAL REFERENCES REGULATION G (NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURE) This report includes information that does not conform to U.S. GAAP and are considered non-GAAP measures. These measures include operating EBITDA. Management uses these measures internally for planning and forecasting, including allocating resources and evaluating incentive compensation. Management believes that these non-GAAP measures best reflect the ongoing performance of the Company during the periods presented and provide additional more relevant and meaningful information to investors as they provide insight with respect to ongoing operating results of the Company and a more useful comparison of year-over-year results. These non-GAAP measures supplement the Company’s U.S. GAAP disclosures and should not be viewed as an alternative to U.S. GAAP measures of performance. Furthermore, such non-GAAP measures may not be consistent with similar measures provided or used by other companies. Reconciliations for these non-GAAP measures to U.S. GAAP are provided below. Operating EBITDA is defined as earnings (loss) (i.e., income (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes) before interest, depreciation, amortization, non-operating benefits (costs), foreign exchange gains (losses), and net unrealized gain or loss from mark-to-market activity for certain foreign currency derivative instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting, excluding the impact of significant items. Non-operating benefits (costs) consists of non-operating pension and OPEB benefits (costs), tax indemnification adjustments, environmental remediation and legal costs associated with legacy businesses and sites, and the 2021 officer indemnification payment. Tax indemnification adjustments relate to changes in indemnification balances, as a result of the application of the terms of the Tax Matters Agreement, between Corteva and Dow and/or DuPont that are recorded by the company as pre-tax income or expense. Net unrealized gain or loss from mark-to-market activity for certain foreign currency derivative instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting represents the non-cash net gain (loss) from changes in fair value of certain undesignated foreign currency derivative contracts. Upon settlement, which is within the same calendar year of execution of the contract, the realized gain (loss) from the changes in fair value of the non-qualified foreign currency derivative contracts will be reported in the relevant non-GAAP financial measures, allowing quarterly results to reflect the economic effects of the foreign currency derivative contracts without the resulting unrealized mark to fair value volatility.

In addition to recognizing the direct impact of mining activities to the environment, Newmont\tfirmly\tbelieves\tthat\tclimate\tchange\tis\tthe\t greatest existential crisis facing the industry and that we have a fundamental responsibility, alongside government, investors and communities, to effect change. Our Climate Report provides stakeholders with an understanding\tof\thow\twe\tmanage\tthe\timpact\t of climate\tchange\ton\tour\toperations\tthrough\t scenario planning and risk analysis, including considering\tthe\timpact\tof\tinflation\tand\tgeopolitical\t influences.\tThis\treport\talso\tdetails\thow\twe\tare\t contributing to addressing this global problem. Transparency is fundamental to our environmental, social and governance practices, and part of what sets Newmont apart. Inherent to this is establishing public targets and having our performance against those targets independently validated. Newmont has set robust emissions reduction targets: 32% reduction of Scope 1 and 2 emissions and 30% reduction of Scope 3 emissions by 2030, with the ultimate goal to be carbon neutral by 2050. In 2021, our 2030 targets were validated and approved by the Science Based Targets initiative. This process was important to assess that Newmont's actions are aligned with those required to have an impact on addressing climate change. Throughout 2021, we took important steps to ensure we meet these targets. We have established a dedicated Energy and Decarbonization program, and embedded the emissions reduction targets into our capital investment process as well as our business planning process. The link between our environmental, social and governance performance and\tfinancial\tstrategies\twas\tstrengthened\twith\tthe\t issuance\tof\tthe\tmining\tindustry’s\tfirst\tsustainability‑ linked bond. Through the bond, we are directly connecting\tNewmont’s\tfinancial\tperformance\twith\t our 2030 emissions reduction targets and female representation in senior leadership. As we develop and execute our roadmaps to achieve our 2030 targets and 2050 goal, energy and emissions reduction work has been integrated into our Full Potential continuous improvement program. Full Potential provides the structure and focus at each operational site to reduce consumption and wasted energy, and importantly, the mechanisms to replicate improvements across all our business. We are studying options for renewable energy projects,\tsite‑level\tefficiencies\tand\tconversion\tof\t power purchase agreements. This includes projects at Boddington and Tanami in Australia as well as our Yanaococha\tmine\tin\tPeru\twhich\twill\tbe\t responsible for reducing emissions by more than 1M tCO2e annually. Likewise, we have turned our focus to investing in and examining future technical solutions to help address climate change. At Newmont, we have challenged ourselves and our original equipment manufacturers to drive innovation and bring forward bold\tsolutions.\tIn\t2021,\twe\tannounced\t a $100\tmillion\tstrategic\talliance\twith\tCaterpillar\tInc.\t to fundamentally change the mining industry through the rapid development and deployment of equipment, technologies, infrastructure and processes to achieve zero-emissions mining. The result\twill\tbe\ta\tcomprehensive\tmining\tsystem\t including an all-electric autonomous haulage system for\tboth\topen\tpit\tand\tunderground\tmining.\t Understanding that we cannot achieve our goals alone, Newmont continues to collaborate with our joint venture partner as well as our supply and value chain partners\tto\tidentify\temissions\treduction\t opportunities to address our Scope 3 emissions. These emissions account for more than 60% of Newmont’s\ttotal\temissions\tprofile,\twith\tour\t joint ventures\tand\tpurchased\tgoods\tand\tservices\t amounting for more than two-thirds of our Scope 3 emissions.\t We\tfirmly\tbelieve\tthat\tto\taddress\tclimate\tchange\tand\t shape our industry for the future, we must have the vision, ambition and technical expertise to do so. As Newmont looks to the future following our 100th anniversary, we continue to strengthen our commitment to our purpose to create value and improve lives through sustainable and responsible mining. It is our belief that through this dedication, combined\twith\tour\tsize\tand\tscale\tas\tthe world’s\t leading gold company, we are well positioned to address climate change.

      "Newmont Corporation 2021 Climate Report Strategy 6 Our Role in the Transition to a Low-Carbon Economy Founded in 1921 and publicly traded since 1925, Newmont is the world’s leading gold company and a producer of copper, lead, silver and zinc. The Company is an industry leader in value creation and is widely recognized for principled environmental, social and governance (ESG) practices. Newmont, and the materials we produce, will play an important role in transitioning the world to a low-carbon economy.

The International Council on Mining and Metals (ICMM) committed its member companies to build clear pathways to achieving net-zero Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions by 2050 or sooner through meaningful short- and/or medium-term targets. At the same time, the clean energy transition is increasing the demand for the metals and minerals Newmont produces. Copper, silver and zinc are essential for making solar panels work. Copper is also an essential metal in wind turbines and electric vehicles. Newmont is well-positioned in copper and continues to expand our production, giving us a competitive advantage to support the transition to a low-carbon economy while ensuring economic resiliency. Gold also supports the transition, as outlined in the World Gold Council article on “Gold’s Role in a Low- carbon Economy.”\tAs\tan\tindustrial\tmaterial,\tgold\tcan\tplay\ta\tvital\trole\tin\ttechnologies\tthat\tfacilitate\tthe\t transition to a low-carbon future.

BUSINESS PLANNING Our annual business plan serves as a roadmap to guide our operating plans and performance over the current year and beyond. As part of our annual business planning process, Newmont tracks the carbon emissions associated with our annual budget and compares actual monthly Scope 1 and 2 emissions to planned emissions each month as a key business metric. Our life-of-asset approach to operational and business planning ensures that we periodically update our forecast for carbon emissions and that each successive business plan forecasts the emissions associated with our operational plans so that we are tracking progress on our carbon reduction commitments.

Additionally, increased competition for land resources for agriculture will lead to a preference to limit mining to materials with perceived higher societal utility and conserve resources, such as fertile lands and water, for agricultural activities. Between now and 2030, Newmont anticipates few, if any, opportunities to rely on innovation and technology transitions to support our aims to reduce emissions.

Purchased grid electricity comprises 39 percent (15.22 million GJ) of Newmont's total energy consumption (39.09 million GJ). Since the company's switch towards market- based GHG accounting, we continue to work through defining the exact grid mixes of sites at which we don't yet have PPAs. At this time, some of the sites' grid mixes have been updated to represent market-based GHG accounting, and some remain location-based averages until we work through which renewables we can take credit for. 2 Newmont’s combined renewable energy sources (solar, biodiesel and purchased grid electricity from renewable sources) accounted for 9 percent (3.55 million GJ) of total energy consumption in 2021. 3 SASB Metals & Mining Sustainability Accounting Standard EM-MM-130a.1: 2) percentage grid electricity, 3) percent renewable.\n",

Additionally, 2020 figures differ from what was originally reported as a result of updating inputs to further improve reporting. 2 Newmont's previous Scope 3 base year amount was 4.640M tCO2e. In comparison to this previous Scope 3 base year amount, our 2021 Scope 3 emissions have increased 27% with the revised methodology, which is in the process of being reviewed by SBTi. has increased. This increase is driven by the changes in methodology, increased spend and increased production in 2021. 3 Supplier-specific emission factors are used to estimate greenhouse gas emissions where available. Where relevant supplier factors are unavailable, a combination of relevant emissions factors from the UK Government GHG Conversion Factors for Company Reporting (BEIS) and Supply Chain Greenhouse Gas Emission Factors for US Industries and Commodities available at the beginning of the reporting period, and life cycle emission factors from the Ecoinvent (IPCC 2007 GWP 100z V1.04) database were used. The UK BEIS emissions factors include CO2, N2O and CH4 gases in the calculations, whereas the Ecoinvent database includes all greenhouse gases included in the Kyoto Protocol. The IPCC's Fifth Assessment Report global warming potential (GWP) rates were utilized. 4 Categories listed as \"not relevant\" have been assessed as such based on the relevance test set out within the GHG Protocol Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard. 5 Investments include Newmont's equity share of our joint ventures’ Scope 1 and 2 emissions. 2019 and 2020 Category 15 emissions were location- based values. Beginning in 2021, we began receiving market-based values from our joint ventures, and will continue reporting market-based values based on provided information moving forward. Following the Technical Guidance for Calculating Scope 3 Emissions from GHG Protocol, at this time, Scope 3 emissions generated from our joint ventures are excluded in this calculation. Exclusion was determined following an internal relevancy test reviewing criteria of size, influence and ability to obtain data. Criteria and relevancy will be reviewed in the future and updated as necessary. 6 GRI Standards disclosure 305-3: Other indirect (Scope 3) GHG emissions.

      "DOW | 2021 ESG REPORT | 4 Dear Stakeholders, This year Dow marks its 125th anniversary. While we celebrate our rich heritage, we are also imagining how we can build a better, more sustainable and equitable future. As a science and technology company, we eagerly take on the responsibility for finding answers to the most pressing challenges of our time. This is central to our purpose as a company. It is central to our growth strategy. And it is central to driving best-in-class performance and accountability. Throughout this report, you will see how we are using our Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) approach as a catalyst for innovation and collaboration to create new products, new business models and new ways to build value for our customers, our people, our communities and our stockholders. It is clear to us that sustainable innovation and profitable growth are not mutually exclusive, but rather mutually dependent. It is also clear that our intentional focus on collaboration and inclusion helps us better navigate challenges and grow our impact to deliver positive change for the world. We have crafted a portfolio that is well-positioned to meet the increasing needs of our customers and consumers who are demanding more circular and sustainable products around the world. We have a clear, science-based, disciplined and affordable path to carbon neutrality, even while we continue to grow our capacity and improve transparency and accountability on all our sustainability efforts. To advance our efforts, we are continuing to build a strong and inclusive culture, which is evidenced by our recognition as the only materials science company to earn a place on the Great Place to Work and Fortune 100 Best Companies to Work For list. At the same time, we know that best-in-class governance means continuous improvement, and we are committed to challenging ourselves and raising the bar by further enhancing diversity at all levels throughout the company. Here are some of the important ways we advanced our ESG agenda in 2021: • We are executing on our plan to decarbonize our business and grow value. To reach our 2030 and 2050 carbon emissions targets we have a plan to replace end-of-life assets with new, more carbon-efficient technologies. In 2021, for example, we announced plans to build the world’s first net- zero carbon emissions, integrated ethylene cracker and derivatives site in Fort Saskatchewan, Alberta. In addition, we outlined a detailed roadmap to reduce current CO2 emissions from our operations in Terneuzen, the Netherlands, by more than 40% by 2030. We are one of the top 20 global corporations using renewable, clean energy, and we expanded our access to renewable energy to more than 900 megawatts. We also continue to invest in next- generation, carbon-efficient technologies such as e-cracking, fluidized catalytic dehydrogenation (FCDh) technology and ethane dehydrogenation (EDH). • We are accelerating our sustainability investments to enable design for recyclability and more circular plastics through mechanical and advanced recycling. To advance our 2030 targets to Stop the Waste and Close the Loop, our team is working across our value chains to enable packaging design with recyclability in mind. We also have our own product line of recycled-content resins under the brand name REVOLOOP™. Today, 85% of our products sold into packaging applications are reusable or recyclable. As we continue down our path to enable more recyclability and keep plastic waste out of the environment, we are scaling supply partnerships with companies such as Mura Technology and Fuenix to produce circular feedstocks from advanced recycling processes. In fact, we are committed to delivering circular polymers from advanced recycling by the end of 2022. We also are investing in collaborative actions to minimize and manage plastic waste through partnerships such as the Alliance to End Plastic Waste.\n",
      "DOW | 2021 ESG REPORT | 5 • We continue to take deliberate actions to drive inclusion, diversity and equity throughout our organization and beyond. We believe diverse teams make more innovative and better-performing teams. That is why we are institutionalizing inclusion in everything we do – from hiring to who has a seat at the decision-making table. We are creating a culture that embraces and values differences. In 2021, we introduced new global paid time-off policies that will provide employees with equal opportunity for parental leave, to take care of their families, and to volunteer and engage in Employee Resource Group (ERG) activities. Our ERG participation is redefining best-in-class performance, with nearly 100% of People Leaders and more than 50% of global employees participating. We also continue to advance supply chain diversity. Since launching four years ago, our Supply Chain Diversity Program has led to more than $1.74 billion in spend with small and diverse suppliers and delivered over $15 million in EBIT to our bottom line. • We are mobilizing alliances of diverse stakeholders to create meaningful social change across our communities. In 2021, we increased our commitment to $13 million for Dow ACTs, a framework designed to address systemic racism and inequality. We joined OneTen, a coalition of businesses that have pledged to upskill, hire and advance 1 million Black individuals in the United States over the next decade. We also continued engagement with historically Black colleges and universities (HBCUs) to reinforce the STEM and Ph.D. pipelines. Through the Future of STEM Scholars Initiative (FOSSI), we are underwriting the education of 10 students per year who are pursuing STEM degrees at HBCUs to help increase the number of underrepresented professionals in the chemical industry. And because we believe sustainable business creates positive social change, we invested $2 million in seed grants for projects in 12 countries, including infrastructure projects that help keep plastic waste out of the environment and back into the circular economy. • We are improving governance, transparency and accountability across Dow. We have raised the bar in our ESG reporting and disclosures through improved carbon emissions and circularity reporting and improved climate risk disclosures and greenhouse gas intensity metrics. And we are working with the World Economic Forum’s International Business Council to help develop consistent international frameworks for reporting and accounting standards for ESG matters. We continued to actively deepen and diversify our Board, electing three new directors in 2021 and 2022. Also, we modified our Annual Performance Award and Executive Compensation Program metrics to include ESG components – holding every member of Team Dow accountable for the same metrics that we report to all our stakeholders. A sustainable world is one of intersections – between the environment and society, science and innovation, collaboration and action. Because the challenges facing our local and global communities are increasingly complex and interconnected, they demand a collaborative and integrated approach. They also require game-changing ideas fueled by science. Within this report, you’ll see how Dow is working with our stakeholders to deliver on a broad range of ESG priorities through our purpose-driven strategies and processes. I’m proud of the many ways that Team Dow is making real progress in helping society meet its most urgent needs. While we know there is still much work to do, we are passionately committed – as we have been for well over a century – to imagine a better world. A more equitable world. A more resilient world. A more sustainable world. And a company that will thrive for the next 125 years as it helps build that new future. Sincerely, Jim Fitterling Chairman and Chief Executive Officer As a science and technology company, we eagerly take on the responsibility for finding answers to the most pressing challenges of our time.\n",

Our plans build on the 15% emissions reductions we have already achieved since 2005 – during a period of significant growth – and enable us to reduce our Scope 1 and 2 emissions by another 15%, for a total of 30%, by 2030, while continuing to grow earnings. This modernization of our manufacturing assets will be a catalyst in helping us reach our 2050 zero-carbon3 emissions target. Fort Saskatchewan: World’s First Net-Zero Carbon Emissions Integrated Ethylene Cracker and Derivatives Site In 2021, we announced our plan to build the world’s first net-zero 4 carbon emissions integrated ethylene cracker and derivatives site at our Fort Saskatchewan, Alberta, complex. The project will triple the site’s ethylene and polyethylene capacity and decarbonize 20% of our global ethylene capacity. In addition to the new cracker, we will retrofit existing assets to achieve net-zero carbon emissions at the site. It will enable our company to produce and supply more than 3 million metric tons of certified low- to zero-carbon emissions polyethylene and ethylene derivatives for customers and joint venture partners around the globe. • The project will leverage the best-in-class manufacturing technology deployed at our Texas-9 facility in Freeport, Texas, which delivers ethylene and derivatives products at up to 60% lower carbon emissions intensity and 65% lower conversion costs than our average cracker at 20% lower capital cost versus the industry. • To get to net-zero carbon emissions for the Alberta site, we also will invest in capabilities to convert cracker off-gas into circular hydrogen to be used as a clean fuel in the production process. Carbon emissions will be captured, transported and stored by adjacent third-party CO2 infrastructure. Terneuzen: A Roadmap to Reduce CO2 Emissions by 40% by 2030 Another example of low-carbon innovation is taking place in Terneuzen, the Netherlands, which is one of Dow’s largest integrated sites. The Terneuzen team announced plans in 2021 to reduce the site’s overall carbon emissions by 40% by 2030 using technology and engineering advancements. This puts the site on a path to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050. The plan has three phases5: • Phase 1: Build a clean hydrogen plant where byproducts from core production processes are converted into hydrogen and CO2. Hydrogen is then used as a clean fuel in the production process. The hydrogen plant will enable the site to reduce CO2 emissions by approximately 1.4 million metric tons per year. This is equivalent to the annual emissions of more than 300,000 cars. Building the new hydrogen plant and the associated infrastructure is expected to create 3,500 to 4,000 engineering and construction jobs over a three-year period and 400-500 permanent jobs at Dow, in the region and across associated service providers. • Phase 2: Capture CO2 from Dow’s ethylene oxide plant and replace several gas turbines with electrical motor drives by 2030. This will avoid a further 300,000 metric tons of CO2 emissions per year. • Phase 3: Develop and implement additional breakthrough technologies to replace fuel usage in the production processes. An example is our collaboration with Shell  to electrify ethylene steam-cracking furnaces. CLIMATE PROTECTION 3 Zero-carbon emissions: Means reduction of Scope 1, 2 and 3 carbon emissions, including offsets from product benefits and technology advancements.

      "ENVIRONMENTAL PERFORMANCE INROADS FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT DOW | 2021 ESG REPORT | 22 CLIMATE PROTECTION Reducing Emissions Across Our Value Chain Scope 3 emissions are inclusive of upstream emissions from products and services we procure from suppliers, as well as downstream emissions from the transportation of our products and the emissions emanating from the use and disposal of our sold products. These emissions are critical to Dow and represent approximately 70% of our total emissions. Because more than half of our Scope 3 emissions come from raw materials, transportation and other services we purchase as a company, it is critical to partner with suppliers and customers across the value chain to reduce emissions. Purchased goods and services We have partnered with CDP (formerly the Carbon Disclosure Project) to collect climate data from approximately 100 suppliers, representing 31% of our 2020 spend. Of those suppliers, 92% of respondents reported Scope 1 carbon emissions, and 80% have set a carbon reduction target. We are expanding the CDP program to target engagement with approximately 350 suppliers in 2022 and 500 globally in 2023, with an ask to disclose carbon emissions data and reduction plans. With this data, we will improve the accuracy of our Scope 3 values along with our ability to take action and track progress toward our emissions reduction goals. Transportation footprint Our Integrated Supply Chain (ISC) team developed the Transportation Carbon Footprint Tracker, which collects shipment data and uses with the Global Logistics Emissions Council (GLEC) Framework to calculate the carbon emissions generated at the shipping stage. This tracker produces much more granular data than historical reporting and will serve as the main source of transportation emissions data internally. Externally, this tracker can provide a baseline for discussions with customers and lead to collaborative efforts to reduce transportation emissions across the value chain. Value chain and enhancing ESG engagement Several efforts are underway to embed ESG criteria into supplier engagement activities, including all requests for proposals, tenders, contracts and supplier relationship management strategies. This will help us access robust ESG data and include sustainability as a key metric in the decision-making matrix. Beyond our efforts within Purchasing and Integrated Supply Chain, we are investing in external collaborations to meet the goals we share with many stakeholders across our value chains. For example, in 2021, we joined Together for Sustainability, an industry group that enables us to engage with suppliers in a streamlined and strategic way alongside our peers in the chemical sector. We also are collaborating with the World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD) through the Partnership for Climate Transparency (PACT) to develop robust methodologies and systems for sharing product carbon footprint data along supply chains. In addition, we actively participate in several working groups that focus on improving sustainability in the chemical industry through the European Chemical Industry Council (Cefic) and the American Chemistry Council (ACC). Our logistics supplier award programs (S4TAR and DowGOL) are designed to encourage and recognize logistics partners for excellent performance in the areas of safety, sustainability, social responsibility and service. The award program acts as a platform for sharing best practices, partnership cultivation, operation excellence recognition and sustainability advocacy. Every year, Dow surveys its logistics partners about their sustainability strategies, certifications, carbon reduction efforts, waste reduction, recycling efforts and water conservation, as well as employee training and incentivization.

The project will install water control structures to increase water supply to the interior of Loch Leven, a floodplain that has been isolated by levees since the 1800s, and reconnect the tract to the Mississippi River. This will restore hydrology to the wetlands, improve water quality through sediment and nutrient reduction, enhance the land for wildlife habitat, and provide 23.4 billion gallons of flood storage capacity – helping build resilience against storms. Collaborating with Ralph Lauren to Accelerate Water Solutions in the Textile Industry Every year, water-intensive industries such as the textile and fashion industry use trillions of liters of water in fabric dyeing.1 These industries are seeking new ways to create garments more responsibly. Dow and the iconic global brand Ralph Lauren began working together in 2018 as Ralph Lauren actively searched for solutions to more sustainably and effectively color their cotton apparel to reduce water use, emissions and harmful chemicals. The solution? Dow’s ECOFAST™ Pure Sustainable Textile Treatment, an award-winning technology for cationic pretreatment applied before the cotton-dyeing process. This technology can dramatically reduce the number of resources needed to color cotton, enabling brands to use up to 50% less water, up to 40% less energy with room-temperature dyeing, up to 90% less chemicals, and reduce their carbon footprint by up to 60%. Together, Dow and Ralph Lauren made great strides advancing ECOFAST™ Pure in the textiles industry including: • The launch of “Color on Demand™,” Ralph Lauren’s multi-phased platform powered by ECOFAST™ Pure, with the ambition to create the world’s first scalable, zero-wastewater cotton-dyeing system. Ralph Lauren, the first brand to use ECOFAST™ Pure, partnered with Dow to optimize and implement the technology in its cotton-dyeing operations, as part of the first phase of its Color on Demand platform. • The launch of select cotton products in Ralph Lauren’s 2020 Team USA Collection dyed using ECOFAST™ Pure, including village wear and Opening Ceremony Olympics pieces. • The release of a detailed, open-source manual by Dow and Ralph Lauren.

We believe so. Under a Dow strategic sustainability initiative, Project Ybá – Conservation that Transforms, we are collaborating with multiple parties to develop and scale a community-oriented “bio-business” model in Brazil’s Amazon rainforest that sustainably uses standing-forest resources, such as seeds and fruits, and provides livelihoods for families. Near our Breu Branco site, Dow maintains a 38,000-hectare Amazon rainforest preserve, half the size of New York City. Surrounding the preserve, continued deforestation and ecosystem degradation pose major economic, cultural and environmental threats to the region. Project Ybá seeks to empower Amazon communities to protect biodiversity and generate income by developing a local cooperative that would harvest seeds, fruits and other renewable resources – called bioactives – on Dow’s forestland and then sell them for use in cosmetics or other products. Currently, Dow is collaborating with the Peabiru Institute and TNC to analyze the biodiversity within Dow’s preserved native Amazon forests and identify a local community to manage the commercial cooperative. Dow is also working with cosmetics brand Natura, the first commercial collaborator of Project Ybá. Natura will support the development of the local cooperative and contribute its expertise in the technical evaluation of the bioactives. In 2021, Dow and our project partners: • Completed biodiversity mapping of Dow’s preserve to evaluate its potential as a source for bioactives. A survey found 17 species of commercial interest identified on the land. Of particular interest to Natura was andiroba, a tropical tree that usually produces 180 to 200 kilograms of seeds per plant each year. Approximately 60% of their weight is oil. Andiroba seed oil is used in the pharmaceutical and cosmetics industry because of its analgesic, antibacterial, anti-inflammatory, antifungal ability and anti-allergic properties.1 • Completed 22 social field visits to identify a local community as a commercial partner for the cooperative. Supported by Dow, the Peabiru Institute will develop and train a local cooperative to harvest and sell bioactives. Once the commercial cooperative is fully trained and organized, it is estimated that up to 150 families will benefit from Project Ybá’s sustainable commerce. • Engaged TNC and EcoMetrix Solutions Group to quantify ecosystem services at the preserve using an existing tool developed through Dow’s partnership with TNC. This will help identify the key parameters needed to incorporate harvesting practices that respect forest life cycles and maintain native species. Eventually, Dow and its collaborators expect to scale Project Ybá’s sustainable commerce model to other communities to help preserve and restore the Amazon rainforest. By fostering a culture of land stewardship that supports inclusion and generates job opportunities, we intend to show that the environment, society and business growth can all thrive together. 1 https://bioresources.cnr.ncsu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/BioRes_15_1_894_SodreSouza_PFODQ_Valoriz_Andiroba_Residue_Optimiz_Alk_Pretreatm_Ferment_Sugar_16508.pdf  CLIMATE PROTECTION\n",

The issue is complex, and through partnerships, we are working across the value chain to improve collection, access to recycling and processing infrastructure. We also are creating new business models that will impact the overall recycling rates of plastics. Improving circularity of plastics through recycling and reuse is critical to a world that is also targeting carbon emissions reduction. The lower-carbon benefits of polyethylene-based packaging serve as a key driver and source of value. Moving to circular products means incorporating recycling feedstocks from waste instead of more extraction of fossil fuels. Investing to improve plastics recycling infrastructure Helping communities address waste management gaps Partnering across the value chain to bring hard-to-recycle plastics into the circular economy Helping customers design for recyclability Growing our recyclable/ renewable business Scaling advanced recycling Close the Loop Stop the Waste By 2030, we will enable 1MM metric tons of plastic per year to be collected, reused or recycled through direct actions and partnerships. In 2021, we enabled the collection, reuse or recycling of 23,000 metric tons of plastic waste, up from 8,000 metric tons in 2020. 2020 2021 Through our Close the Loop (CTL) target, we are tracking our progress toward enabling 100% of the packaging applications we sell to be recyclable or reusable by 2035. In support of and in collaboration with our value chain partners, we align our innovation and application development programs to ensure we have the right solutions at the right time. And our year-over-year progress shows that it’s working. Close the Loop Progress % of packaging applications that are recyclable or reusable in 2021: 85% Dow is working on continuous improvement in progress measurement of its Close the Loop and Stop the Waste metrics. These metrics, and Close the Loop in particular, are in the very early stages of their maturity within Dow and the broader industry. In our attempts to minimize uncertainties and connect to externally reported sources of information, we made improvements to our process, which led to a shift in our 2020 baseline metric for the Close the Loop metric from 81% to 82%. The current CTL metric is primarily built upon the external ratios of recyclability for given material production, however Dow is pursuing developing its own ratios for the production level metric as well as an opportunity to include a more specific measurement focused on specific sales into enabled applications in the future. 0.02 0.03 0.14 0.16 0.50 Flexible PE from Dow Paper, Box Rigid, PP Metal, Jar Glass, Jar Cradle-to-Grave Carbon Footprint, kg CO2/package Even accounting for higher recycling rates in other materials, flexible low-carbon-emitting PE from Dow has a carbon footprint advantage1 Dow Flexible PE has the Lowest CO2 Footprint 1 Dow analysis using LCA method and EcoInvent database, comparing all PE stand-up pouch, paper box, rigid PP, and glass and metal jar designs\n",

That’s why we are committed to helping our customers and brand owners redesign and create packaging solutions that are both high-performance AND recyclable. HELPING CUSTOMERS DESIGN FOR RECYCLABILITY In 2021, we demonstrated that recyclable structures were possible for 16 packaging applications that were previously considered unrecyclable. Dow’s unique product portfolio, such as RETAIN™ polymer modifier, ELITE™ AT enhanced polyethylene resin, INNATE™ polyethylene resins and more, is driving these conversions toward recyclability. A few design-for-recyclability solutions include: Toothpaste tubes: Unrecyclable toothpaste tubes alone account for an estimated 100,000 tons of waste each year. Because toothpaste is sensitive to oxygen and humidity, manufacturers traditionally create tubes made from a combination of different plastics as well as a layer of aluminum – making the packaging nearly impossible to recycle. Using high-performance polyethylene-based technologies, Dow developed a solution that solved the recyclability issue by removing the aluminum layer, while still protecting the integrity of toothpaste products. Phormanto™ polyethylene rich thermoforming technology: Dow’s Phormanto™ polyethylene rich thermoforming technology is helping meet increased consumer demand for sustainable packaging by offering a solution for vacuum thermoformed packages that increases the shelf life of poultry packaging for up to two weeks. A leak- proof packaging technology that reduces costs and waste in every step of the value chain, Phormanto™ is made of a single-material plastic so it can fit neatly into the well- established recycle streams that already exist for polyethylene. GROWING OUR CIRCULAR AND RENEWABLE BUSINESS This year, we announced several advancements in our efforts to prevent plastic waste, reduce greenhouse gas emissions and provide customers with recycled plastic products that provide the same performance as virgin plastics derived from fossil fuel-based feedstocks. As a result, our plastics made with recycled content, bio-based and/or renewable sources reached over a hundred million dollars in sales and utilized 4,000 metric tons of renewable/circular feedstock this year. With these advancements, our company will be well-positioned to provide an initial supply of fully circular polymers to customers starting in 2022, further reducing fossil fuel feedstocks by incorporating waste as the new feedstock. ECOLIBRIUM™ technology enables sustainability and Crocs: ECOLIBRIUM™ is a technology that enables more sustainable polymers for applications such as footwear, beverage cartons, food and personal care packaging, caps, labels and hot- melt adhesives.

In 2021, we sold and launched 12 product grades of REVOLOOP™ resins, with applications ranging from rigid bottles and collation shrink to e-commerce bags and protective packaging. Mattress recycling now a reality with start-up of RENUVA™ plant: By turning end-of-life mattresses into RENUVA™ polyols for use in new mattresses and other applications, our RENUVA™ Mattress Recycling Program is contributing to both a circular and low-carbon economy. In 2021, we launched the world’s first industrial-scale reactor for the chemical recycling of end-of-life mattresses in France. The collective effort brings together Dow Polyurethanes and chemical innovator Orrion Chemicals Orgaform with mattress collector Eco-mobilier, turnkey solutions provider H&S Anlagentechnik and foam manufacturer The Vita Group. When operating at full capacity, the plant will recycle polyurethane foam from up to 200,000 used mattresses per year – mattresses that otherwise would be incinerated. At the new RENUVA™ plant, polyurethane foam from end-of-life mattresses is chemically recycled to create a new polyol, which is a key starting material to produce polyurethane. The RENUVA™ polyol produced from the recycled foam contains approximately 40-45% recycled content and can be tailored for different applications. The first batch of RENUVA™ polyols was delivered to The Vita Group, providing a more sustainable offering to the bedding market. An externally certified lifecycle analysis was conducted for RENUVA™ and found that the process provides a reduction of more than 50% in CO2 equivalent emissions in comparison with the standard polyol production process. Through collaboration, materials science and innovation, the RENUVA™ Mattress Recycling Program generates value from waste mattresses, addresses the issue of mattress disposal, creates new business ecosystems and at the same time reduces the carbon footprint. Turning Automotive Waste into New Car Products By turning automotive waste into new polyurethane foam-based solutions for vehicle interiors, we are helping car manufacturers meet their market and regulatory demands for more circular products. Created using a mass balance approach, SPECFLEX™ C and VORANOL™ C solutions are made from a circular feedstock produced from recycled and locally obtained automotive waste that replaces virgin fossil fuel-based feedstock. This approach serves as an efficient and validated way for automotive OEMs to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and fossil feedstock inputs, meet regulatory standards and achieve their own ambitious sustainability goals. SPECFLEX™ C and VORANOL™ C are initially being offered through two automotive suppliers, Adient and Autoneum.

We’re doing this in partnership with a number of organizations. In 2021, we teamed with Mura Technology, which has demonstrated that it can recycle all forms of plastic – including multi-layer, flexible plastics used in packaging, which are currently harder to recycle and often incinerated or sent to landfill. We also expanded our initial partnership with Fuenix Ecogy Group to scale its advanced recycling production with the construction of a second plant in Weert in the Netherlands. The new plant will process 20,000 metric tons of waste plastic into pyrolysis oil feedstock annually, which will be used to produce new circular plastic at our Terneuzen site. We also received the International Sustainability & Carbon Certification (ISCC) PLUS recognition at five of our largest global manufacturing facilities for our compliance with rigorous tracking of sustainable feedstocks use. The certification was awarded following an independent, external audit to ensure product supply chains are fully traceable and that Dow and its suppliers are adhering to and accelerating sustainable practices. Operation Clean Sweep® As a member of Operation Clean Sweep® (OCS), a plastics containment program designed to prevent pellet, flake and powder loss to the environment, we are engaged in this important initiative to help achieve zero pellet loss. Dow is committed to transparency in pellet loss reporting. We have a sustainable program structure to improve plastics containment in our manufacturing, logistics and environmental facilities worldwide, including auditing, reporting and substantial facility investments. Management systems have been implemented across the value stream, driving progress in manufacturing, logistics and commercial operations. In 2021, two events occurred that resulted in greater than 0.5kg of plastic pellet losses outside our company-operated facilities. We also are actively working with suppliers, logistics service providers and customers to implement similar robust systems focused on proactive plastics containment. In 2021, we expanded our leadership by incorporating OCS in-sourcing activities, operational performance metrics and supplier relationship management. Our logistics service providers that actively handle plastic pellets are pledged to OCS and have implemented the OCS guidance to reduce the risk of pellet loss. To ensure accountability and joint improvement toward a zero-pellet loss supply chain, standardized OCS contractual language was included in existing agreements.

This message is reinforced by leadership at every level of the company. To ensure worker safety, Dow uses a comprehensive, integrated operating discipline management system that includes policies, requirements, processes, best practices and procedures related to our Environment, Health & Safety (EH&S), Quality and Operations standards, and related external standards. Through this system, we lay the foundational expectations of hazard assessment and risk mitigation, aligned to Responsible Care®. Dow’s programs also include a robust occupational health (OH) system that supports company sites, functions and businesses around the world with health information, resources and consultation on health-related opportunities and issues. Dow requires each function to implement and use health and safety programs to: Identify, assess, eliminate or mitigate hazards Maintain and improve the health of personnel Prevent unsafe acts and conditions Foster communication on health and safety issues\n",
      "HEALTH & SAFETY INTEGRATING SAFETY INTO ALL WE DO DOW | 2021 ESG REPORT | 37 OUR ACTIONS 2021 – A YEAR OF ACCOMPLISHMENTS IN SAFETY Despite 2021 being the largest maintenance turnaround year in company history, we were able to achieve some of our best-ever safety performance in several categories that we monitor. A MULTI-YEAR, ZERO-INJURY STREAK FOR MOTOR VEHICLE ACCIDENTS (MVAs) CONTINUED IN 2021 Zero severe MVAs occurred at a Dow site in 2021. This is our longest and best streak, with the most recent severe MVA recorded more than two years ago. BEST-EVER OVERALL SEVERE INJURY PERFORMANCE IN 2021 We went 281 days severe injury-free in 2021. We recorded one severe injury in 2021, compared to six incidents in 2020 and 34 in 2015, when we initially launched our 2025 Sustainability Goals. CONTRACTORS ACHIEVED A SEVERE INJURY-FREE STREAK Our contractors were free of severe injuries for 526 days, as of December 31, 2021. The North America Contractor Safety Task Force helped sustain this notable streak, which is the longest in company history. ZERO FATALITIES IN 2021 We accomplished the one-year fatality- free milestone on March 30, 2021, and remained fatality-free for the rest of the year. Safe in Sound We hosted a Safe in Sound webcast in 2021 to highlight the importance of reducing exposure to noise and introduced resources offered by Dow to help successfully implement noise reduction projects. The audience included EHS&S colleagues, engineers, technicians and leaders aligned to facilities with noise reduction opportunities targeted to achieve by 2025. The Safe in Sound panel discussed a variety of topics, from the identification and prioritization of noise sources to how to scope and implement noise exposure reduction solutions. These sessions were key to driving awareness and leveraging proven solutions, which will help us achieve our Total Worker Health ® 2025 target of reducing high-priority noise risks.\n",
      "HEALTH & SAFETY INTEGRATING SAFETY INTO ALL WE DO DOW | 2021 ESG REPORT | 38 Total Worker Health® – An Overview Dow set a goal in 2015 to achieve 100% on our Total Worker Health® (TWH®) index by 2025, an equally weighted composite score based on three elements: Healthy Workplace, Healthy People and Healthy Culture. As of 2021, we achieved an index score of 74.5%, which has put us on a path to achieve this target one year earlier than anticipated. Below are examples of how we are advancing a Healthy Workplace, Healthy People and Healthy Culture. HEALTHY WORKPLACE: HEALTH RISK REDUCTION EFFORTS We routinely evaluate our workplaces in search of high-priority health risks (P1s), which include ergonomic stressors and exposure to chemicals and high noise levels. We made great progress in our efforts to reduce these risks in 2021. For example: • Dow Performance Materials and Coatings improved its tote cleaning process and is leveraging a new cleaning system across five sites. The new system reduced ergonomic stress, noise exposure and heat stress for workers. • Our polyols plant in San Lorenzo, Argentina, implemented a state-of-the- art pipeline inspection gauge (PIG), which eliminated worker exposure risks to propylene oxide. This technology was leveraged from a sister plant in Cartagena, Colombia. • Our polyols plant in Guarujá, Brazil, collaborated with a third-party logistics company to improve butadiene sampling systems operated by Dow workers. This effort reduced potential exposure to butadiene and resulted in two P1 eliminations. • Dow Consumer Solutions implemented a significant noise control project at a site in Kendallville, Indiana. This effort has eliminated six P1 health risks for more than 70 employees so far. Overall, our P1 elimination work has reduced occupational health risks for nearly 600 Dow employees globally. HEALTHY PEOPLE: RECLAIM YOUR HEALTH CAMPAIGN TAKES A HOLISTIC APPROACH Our OH group launched the Reclaim Your Health campaign in 2021 to remind employees about the importance of self-care and to share resources for employees to maintain their health. To gauge the mental health of employees, OH also launched screening questions as part of their engagement with our medical clinic staff. As a result of the screening implementation, Dow’s medical staff was able to identify employees in need of support and resources. Additionally, all 10 of our ERGs explored elements of mental and physical well- being through webcasts. These virtual engagements especially highlighted psychological safety, which is fundamental to creating joint ownership for advancing the employee experience, addressing stressors, and maintaining or improving mental health. HEALTHY CULTURE: TRACKING OUR PROGRESS Sites annually self-assess their efforts to maintain or improve the health of employees through a healthy culture survey. In 2021, six additional Dow locations received a platinum rating, bringing the total number of sites recognized to 96. Health & Safety Spotlight American Heart Association (AHA) Recognizes Dow’s Healthy Workplace and Culture We were presented gold-level recognition by the AHA in 2021 for the significant steps we took to build a culture of health and well-being for our global workforce. This honor is one of the highlighted accomplishments aligned with our TWH ® efforts, part of the World-Leading Operations 2025 Sustainability Goal.\n",
      "HEALTH & SAFETY INTEGRATING SAFETY INTO ALL WE DO DOW | 2021 ESG REPORT | 39 A Focus on Continuous Improvement in Safety Promoting worker and environmental safety is core to our business and sustainability strategy, and we continually strive to make improvements. The following are examples of how Team Dow was involved in our efforts in 2021. WHAT’S THE WORST THAT COULD HAPPEN? To continue to improve on our cultural journey in personal safety during 2021, EHS&S hosted four interactive and innovative global sessions titled “What’s the Worst That Could Happen?” The objective of these sessions was to share best practices among all functions, businesses and regions regarding critical safety topics, with a focus on fall prevention, heavy equipment, process safety and containment, and contractor safety. Several employees shared their personal workplace incident stories, which reminded us that injuries are not just a metric but can also be a life-altering experience for those impacted. ELIMINATING ELEVATED WORK Audit and near-miss data from 2016-2020 identified an opportunity to eliminate or reduce fall risks. As a result, we: • Formed a Routine Elevated Work Solutions project team that created a toolkit to help identify fall risks at a site and evaluate ways to make a task safer through engineering controls. One of the new techniques to eliminate elevated work included the use of drones for inspections. • Conducted a Fall Prevention Blitz to help prevent fall-related incidents, with a “lifeguard” approach – employees and contractors looking out for one another to ensure safety and immediately address potentially hazardous behaviors. Health & Safety Spotlight In 2020, we had five severe injuries among contractors in North America. In 2021, we recorded zero – globally. This is due to the widespread impact of the North America Contractor Safety Task Force, whose strategy was then successfully leveraged across multiple regions. Learn more on p. 40.\n",
      "HEALTH & SAFETY INTEGRATING SAFETY INTO ALL WE DO DOW | 2021 ESG REPORT | 40 NEW PERSONAL SAFETY STANDARDS Our continual review of incident trends and near-miss data displayed an opportunity to educate employees and contractors, which led to the creation of the two new standards for safe use. • Dow’s Personal Safety Expertise Center drafted a Hand-Held Portable Tools Standard that included tool design requirements and user guides to help combat incidents associated with equipment such as drills and angle grinders. The standard was tested across six sites and the success of the pilots proved the value of thorough standard development. This standard will be rolled out to all employees and contractors in 15 languages in early 2022. • A new Fatigue Risk Management Standard was piloted across sites in the U.S. Gulf Coast in 2021. An impactful takeaway from these pilots came from feedback sessions, which encouraged transparent conversations for leadership to understand the cultural aspects associated with fatigue. The learnings from the regional rollout helped shape a comprehensive global standard, which will be widely released in 2022. The Contractor Safety Task Force Contractors play a vital role in our operations and, like their Dow counterparts, contractors also engage in potentially high-risk tasks while on the job. The Contractor Safety Task Force was chartered in 2021, with an initial focus on North America and a goal to understand best practices and reinforce positive behaviors that were driving optimal safety performance among contractors. This work led to identifying seven key items for best-in-class contractor safety performance: • Foreperson capability, development and engagement • Observation and intervention programs • Joint Dow/contractor onboarding programs • Strong relationship between Dow and contractor senior leaders • Dow management system reviews of policies, processes, procedures and programs • Forums and opportunities to exchange ideas • Contractor inclusion programs The Task Force’s efforts subsequently led to the development of a Contractor Safety Culture Index and recognition program for top-performing sites, both to be released in 2022. Because of the physical and mental demands of the work environment at our manufacturing sites, fatigue is a real risk. The Fatigue Risk Management Program is about finding a solution to this hidden hazard and driving employee safety to the next level. Kevin Martin, senior operations leader in Freeport, Texas\n",

Continuing Our Response to COVID-19 Our response to the COVID-19 pandemic continued with a disciplined management approach to support employees, customers and the community. While 2021 did not bring us relief from the pandemic, we consistently communicated with employees, provided educational seminars and advocated for vaccinations in alignment with the best medical science. All sites encouraged the practices of safe behaviors, both internally and in our communities. During the latter half of 2021, we recognized the need to update the COVID-19 Workplace Playbook  to shape guidelines in a more risk-based manner. The updated playbook uses public health data to determine the risk of infection to employees at each site and has helped us make a safe return to the workplace as we continue to minimize workplace transmission while maintaining business continuity. As we did with the company’s first playbook from April 2020, this revised playbook was shared with our external stakeholders.\n",

      "INCLUSION, DIVERSITY & EQUITY INTENTION, ACTION AND SUSTAINABLE PROGRESS DOW | 2021 ESG REPORT | 53 MILITARY DEGREE EQUIVALENCY (MDE) PROGRAM Veterans acquire outstanding skills during their years of service – skills that bring tremendous value to a business. Understanding the opportunity to bring these veterans’ broad scope of training and experience into a successful career at Dow, the MDE program recognizes relevant military experience of E6 ranking or greater (OR6 for Canada) as equivalent to a bachelor’s degree for U.S. and Canadian job postings. The E6 ranking translates to 8-12 years of experience and has generally equivalent responsibilities across all branches of the military. EXPANDING CAREER OPPORTUNITIES FOR VETERANS David Badour served three deployments in the Navy and held an E6 ranking before coming to Dow. He was working as lead technologist for Dow’s robotics group when he saw a job listing for what would later be his new role. He was interested but didn’t have a bachelor’s degree. Because of the MDE program, he was able to qualify for the role of lead R&D engineering specialist and was promoted to this role in 2021. INCREASING INTERN DIVERSITY THROUGH DOW BRAZIL’S JUMP TO THE FUTURE In 2021, Dow Brazil introduced the Jump to the Future initiative with the goal of increasing diversity among interns. To broaden the talent pool, the program was strategically redesigned, making the English fluency requirement optional. Interns were offered an English course called the “Trampolim Program” and also learned other skills relevant for future job opportunities. SUPPORTING WORKFORCE RE-ENTRY THROUGH THE REACTION PROGRAM Dow’s ReAction Program, launched in 2021, provides a path back to work for those who left the workforce to care for family, have taken an extended medical leave, serve in the U.S. military or for educational reasons. Those hired into the program receive assistance and support to improve their job skills through interacting, engaging and being mentored by experienced Dow business and functional leaders to aid in their return to work. The impact of the program resulted in improved diversity of the 2021 intern class, with 66.7% of African descent, 63% women, 18.5% LGBT+ and 3.7% persons with disabilities. “ReAction allows a path for talent to re-enter the workforce and provides an advantage for Dow in hiring proven, highly skilled professionals.” Gretchen Lupher, senior analytical director, Lake Jackson, Texas\n",

Designed with inclusion in mind, this policy provides all parents equal time away from work to bond with their child. FAMILY CAREGIVER LEAVE POLICY The family caregiver leave policy provides employees with up to three weeks of paid time-off to care for family members who are sick or injured. Family caregiver leave can be used for activities such as accompanying a family member to a scheduled medical appointment, visiting an ill family member in the hospital or hospice, and/or providing care as they receive treatment for and/or recover from an injury or illness. VOLUNTEER AND ERG TIME-OFF Every member of Team Dow – whether they work at a manufacturing site, in an office or in the field – is encouraged to make a positive difference by volunteering and getting involved in one of Dow’s ERGs.

We have found a strong correlation between employees who volunteered and/or participated in ERGs and those who reported a positive employee experience. ENCOURAGING VOLUNTEERING BY LEVELING THE PLAYING FIELD Every member of Team Dow – whether they work at a manufacturing site, in an office or in the field – is encouraged to make a positive difference by volunteering and getting involved in one of Dow’s ERGs. As part of the company’s comprehensive enhancements to Total Rewards and in alignment to our 2025 Engaging for Impact Goal, we launched Dow’s first-ever global Volunteer and ERG Participation policy in September 2021. The policy allows our employees 12 hours of paid time-off to volunteer and engage in ERG activities. As 57% of Dow’s global workforce works in manufacturing, this policy demonstrates our commitment to volunteerism, inclusion and employee equity, by allowing all employees – regardless of job type and level – the ability to take time away from work to volunteer and participate in ERG activities. ADDRESSING GLOBAL CHALLENGES THROUGH EMPLOYEE ENGAGEMENT Through purpose-driven employee engagement programs, Team Dow continues to roll up their sleeves to address some of society’s biggest challenges and advance our communities. 2022 was the second year Dow honored Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Day as a paid U.S. holiday for employees. The holiday was an opportunity for colleagues to learn and engage in conversations about racial equity and give back to their communities. More than 1,000 colleagues across 16 countries participated in a variety of company-offered virtual and in-person volunteer activities. Our #PullingOurWeight program continues to raise awareness around responsible waste management with employees, communities, customers and key stakeholders. In 2021, Dow hosted 195 community cleanups in 32 countries. Our 7,485 participants helped remove 387,513 pounds of waste from the environment, of which 11.27% was recycled.

      "DOW | 2021 ESG REPORT | 71 COMMUNITY INVESTING IN OUR PEOPLE AND PLACES WHERE WE LIVE AND WORK Collaborating with Communities Dow is committed to building resilient communities to address unmet needs while keeping our employees and communities safe. UNDERSTANDING COMMUNITY STAKEHOLDERS’ NEEDS We know that by listening and collaborating with nonprofit partners, we can prioritize and allocate resources to achieve the greatest impact. Some examples of how we learn about and respond to specific community needs include: • In 2021, we launched a Community Opinion and Needs Assessment to provide data-based and objective insights into the needs of strategic Dow communities (defined as cities near large Dow manufacturing facilities). • In Michigan’s Great Lakes Bay Region, we worked with the nonprofit Hidden Harvest to address the 138% increase in food insecurity due to the pandemic. As a result, Hidden Harvest was able to secure a refrigerated truck, enabling them to rescue 2.5 million pounds of food and deliver more than 2 million meals to those in need. • In Zhangjiagang, China, we applied our resources to impact 234 students with disabilities by creating opportunities to build greater confidence, social resilience and career readiness skills. • In Turkey, Dow and local NGO partner ÖRAV initiated the Environmental Literacy program to deliver comprehensive sustainability training to primary school teachers and students. • In India, we engaged with Mann Deshi to equip rural women in Chiplun, near Dow’s Lote plant, with long-term career and entrepreneurial skills. More than 85% of Dow sites globally implement local community engagement programs, which may include employee volunteerism, donations, serving on community boards, participation in community or municipality committees, as well as hosting community advisory committees (CACs). CACs are active at key Dow sites to obtain community perceptions about Dow, share Dow product and technology information, and understand how Dow can improve collaboration with community partners to address community needs. These committees operate across the Dow world and help shape Dow’s global citizenship programming, resource allocation and charitable contribution decisions. All large Dow U.S. manufacturing sites participate in CACs. Outside of the United States, similar committees also meet to understand needs. Dow’s Government Affairs organization also develops and fosters relationships with key elected leaders at all levels of government to advance advocacy priorities. Additionally, we proactively engage with key policymakers, regulators and trade associations to position Dow as a thought leader on priority issues.\n",
      "DOW | 2021 ESG REPORT | 72 COMMUNITY INVESTING IN OUR PEOPLE AND PLACES WHERE WE LIVE AND WORK Collaborating with Communities DISASTER RELIEF The impact of natural disasters in 2021 on Dow communities around the world – including Hurricane Ida in Louisiana, Super Typhoon Rai in the Philippines, widespread flooding in Malaysia, India and China, and a historic freeze in Texas – led Team Dow to rise to the challenge and provide a hand to employees, stakeholders and communities in need. • In 2021, Dow invested in and launched a global Employee Relief Fund, strengthening our response capabilities. This fund, managed by E4E Relief LLC, provides short-term monetary assistance to employees experiencing significant financial hardship following a catastrophic disaster. It is supported through company and individual donations. The fund supported 417 colleagues affected by Hurricane Ida, Hurricane Nicholas and flooding in India with a total of $479,029. • In February 2021, winter storm Uri devastated infrastructure across Texas. Dow and other industry leaders replaced approximately 42,000 feet of metal pipe  with leak- and-corrosion-resistant high-density polyethylene (HDPE) pipe in three Texas towns to aid residents who were left without drinking water. The new pipes, produced by Pipeline Plastics with Dow CONTINUUM™ Bimodal Polyethylene Resins , will help the towns avoid an estimated 3.5 million gallons of annual freshwater loss over the next five years. This project won the 2021 Municipal Leadership Award from the Alliance for PE Pipe. PANDEMIC RELIEF As the COVID-19 crisis evolved in 2021, we continued to work with communities and partners to lend support. • In India, Dow funded a High-Resolution Computed Tomography (HRCT) machine for the Navi Mumbai Municipal Corporation, a civic body that uses the machine for better visualization of the lungs in COVID-19 patients. • In partnership with the Child Mind Institute and supported by WIN, we provided employees, families and educators with evidence-based mental health resources and tools to help improve the quality of life for children and families. • We invested in 2-1-1 support in Michigan, Texas, Louisiana, Pennsylvania, Kentucky, West Virginia and Canada. Through 2-1-1, community members have access to expert help, including the essential mental health and human services they need, 24 hours a day, seven days a week. • We partnered with United Way in Brazil and Argentina, including the Born Learning Program in Brazil, where socially vulnerable children will receive holistic support through nutrition, parenting resources and mental health support, and the Supporting Caregivers Project in Argentina, where caregivers of school-aged children will be supported with resources promoting mental health, self-care and healthy practices aimed at strengthening ties with children. In 2022, as events unfolded in Ukraine and the escalating refugee crisis across the region, the safety of our colleagues remained our top priority. Dow committed support to address immediate humanitarian needs for the people of Ukraine and to work with our partners to aid those suffering as a result of the violence in Ukraine. Supporting Communities Impacted by Hurricane Ida Hurricane Ida, a destructive Category 4 hurricane, was the second-most damaging and intense hurricane to make landfall in Louisiana. In response, the Dow Company Foundation committed $2 million to support immediate relief and long-term recovery efforts in the wake of the storm. National organizations received immediate support, including the American Red Cross, Team Rubicon and Good360, along with regional partners such as affected parishes, local United Ways and food banks. Employees joined with these partners and volunteered to unload, transport and distribute donated items, cook hot meals and assist in cleanup efforts.\n",

Dow’s comprehensive standard includes: • Applying process safety risk management studies to develop emergency response pre-plans for training purposes. • Using onsite and offsite air monitoring to recommend protective actions. • Establishing onsite incident management teams, along with primary and back-up Emergency Operations Centers with trained personnel. • Conducting emergency communications on and off site, including to those with disabilities. • Providing medical emergency support, including trained emergency responders fit for task with appropriate PPE. • Conducting drills, scenario planning, self-assessments, audits and security risk assessments that are reviewed and updated annually – for all shifts and with local emergency response agencies aligned to community standards. COMMUNITY AWARENESS AND OUTREACH Dow sites have a documented Community Outreach program which details site operations, products, applications and distribution to protect the community’s safety, health and the environment. Stakeholder mapping identifies the following as key audiences in community awareness programs: employees, residents and community representatives, local and state authorities, law enforcement agencies, local emergency planning organizations, CACs, educational institutions, media, customers, suppliers and IPark tenants. Dialogue with stakeholders is maintained to educate and improve community confidence in the safe use of chemical technology. “The preservation of life and the protection of our communities and the environment are the highest priorities of Dow’s integrated, companywide crisis management system,” said Scott Whelchel, chief security officer and global director of Emergency Services and Security. “Through timely intelligence, best-in-class standards and technology and a highly trained and effective team, we stand ready to protect the enterprise, Dow people and communities 24/7.” Helping Communities Respond Dow has a long-standing commitment to Transportation Community Awareness and Emergency Response (TRANSCAER®), an industry-wide initiative co-founded by Dow in 1986 to help communities prepare for and respond to hazardous material transportation incidents. Dow has continuous representation on the National TRANSCAER Task Group (NTTG) and supports state and national TRANSCAER activities. While the global pandemic has impacted in-person programming, Dow, in conjunction with TRANSCAER, partners SMS Railways and Conrail, held live training events in the northeastern United States with 129 first responders using the Dow Safety Train in 2021.\n",

RICHARD K. DAVIS Lead Director, Dow President and Chief Executive Officer, Make-A-Wish America Q&A With Richard Davis We talked with our lead director to learn Richard’s perspectives about how strong governance helps drive value today and tomorrow for Dow and its stakeholders. Q: From your perspective as lead director, what qualifications and skills are crucial for an effective board? RD: First, a most effective board is one of diverse thought and diverse backgrounds, and the Dow Board represents that perfectly. We also continually review and assess the talent on the Board to ensure we have the critical experience we need represented. As a result, we regularly bring on new directors, adding fresh viewpoints and important skill sets, like expertise in large capital projects, risk management, ESG matters and global finance. Each director brings unique experiences to the table and gives us an outside-in view of the organization and insights into the different perspectives of our stakeholders. Q: As chair of the Audit Committee, in your view, what elements are essential to effective and strong corporate governance? RD: The primary role of the Audit Committee is to oversee the quality of the performance of the organization and then the quality of reporting about that performance. Our reporting needs to be clear and transparent to our stakeholders so they can understand not just what we’re doing, but also how we’re doing it. We need to make certain our stakeholders have confidence that we’re properly managing risks, like climate change and cybersecurity, and that we have the right internal controls in place to ensure reliability and integrity of our reporting and disclosures. We also continually evaluate and improve. For example, we recently enhanced our ESG reporting and disclosures through improved carbon emissions and circularity reporting, and improved climate risk disclosures and greenhouse gas intensity metrics. Q: What is the role of the Board in ensuring Dow has the right business strategy in place to create long-term value for our stockholders? RD: As a director at Dow, one of our more important responsibilities is to evaluate the performance of the company right now to ensure that we’re doing all that we can to be the great company we promised to be. The other responsibility is strategic. We look ahead to ensure we’re making the decisions and putting plans in place to be even stronger five or 10 years from now. Then we need to convey our strategy clearly to our stakeholders, including our stockholders, so they can be excited about not just the company they own today but the one that they will own in the future. For example, we recently shared our planned pathway to reducing carbon and greenhouse gas emissions while growing the company, which will continue creating strong value for all our stakeholders.\n",
      "DOW | 2021 ESG REPORT | 80 CORPORATE GOVERNANCE INSTRUMENTAL TO ACCOUNTABILITY Q&A With Richard Davis, continued Q: Why is strong corporate governance so important? RD: At Dow, we know that strong corporate governance is critical to achieving our ambition to become the most innovative, customer-centric, inclusive and sustainable materials science company in the world. This begins with a strong, independent Board with the right skills and experiences, clearly defined committee roles and responsibilities, active engagement with company leadership, and oversight of the strategy and overall performance. As a Board, we execute these responsibilities and focus on Dow’s strategic initiatives to continuing financial growth, ESG progress and driving long-term stockholder value. Q: Why does the Board engage directly with Dow’s stakeholders? RD: The only way we can achieve our ambition is by engaging with our stakeholders, including our stockholders, to fully understand their feedback and ensure we continue to serve their interests. As lead director, I enjoy the opportunity to meet with investors, stockholders and other stakeholders. I share their perspectives and viewpoints with the Board, and that enhances our decision-making and helps guide our oversight and input into a broad range of important topics, including Board and management team composition and effectiveness, business strategy development, company performance and risk management. Q: How does the Board view Dow’s ESG goals and performance? RD: As a Board, in addition to financial excellence and integrity, we know that our progress in ESG matters. These topics - like advancing inclusion and equity, plastics circularity and a zero-carbon economy – are top of mind with our stockholders and, in fact, all our stakeholders. At Dow, we are in a leading position and recognized as one of the most progressive companies in this area. We are proud to share our progress with our stakeholders as well as our commitment to continuous improvement both now and in the future. For example, to create even greater accountability for ESG progress, we recently enhanced the link between ESG performance and our compensation programs. I am personally proud of being part of a mission to do well by doing right.\n",

We have included disclosures on our climate-related performance and strategies in accordance with the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD). In our 2021 report, we have met our 2017 commitment to fully implement the recommendations of TCFD. We continue to reference our disclosures to the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) metrics for the chemical sector and the World Economic Forum’s (WEF) Stakeholder Capitalism Metrics. The report also serves as Dow’s communication on progress for its commitment to the United Nations Global Compact. We prepared and presented our report in accordance with the GRI Standards Comprehensive option and the GHG information is presented in accordance with the GHG Protocol.

This process is science-based, ensuring decision-making includes an appropriate evaluation of risk and benefits. It applies to current products as well as those under development. Dow supports a precautionary approach as set out in Principle 15 of the Rio Declaration on Environment and Development and views the precautionary principle as an application of the principles of risk assessment and risk management. Risk assessment includes hazard identification, hazard characterization, exposure assessment and, from these, an overall risk assessment. Risk management encompasses the identification, selection and implementation of alternative actions for addressing risk through the control of identified hazards and/or exposure. We believe the approach should be risk-based and cost-effective.\n",

The Board and management review the company’s short- and long-term strategic priorities throughout the year and dedicate time at each Board meeting for appropriate discussion. 102-19 Delegating authority The Board delegates the day-to-day management of the company, including setting the values and mission of the company and execution of its strategic and ESG priorities, to Dow’s CEO and other senior leaders and provides guidance to and oversight of management.

Each of the directors possess skills and experiences that align with the current needs of the company. See Director Nominees Section (Page 22) in the 2022 Proxy Statement  filed with the SEC on March 4, 2022. 102-23 Chair of the highest governance body Currently, the roles of chairman and CEO are combined with Jim Fitterling serving as chairman and CEO and Richard K. Davis serving as the independent lead director. Mr. Fitterling’s 38-year tenure and multiple roles with the company and in the industry makes him uniquely suited to facilitate the Board’s governance oversight of strategy and safe and effective business operation. Mr. Fitterling’s familiarity with, and knowledge of, our business is unmatched. Furthermore, he has a long history of leadership in reporting transparency and sustainability disclosures. Mr. Fitterling also leads the company’s extensive strategy and ESG priorities, which includes robust public policy development on a national and international level, such as launching the company’s aggressive and ambitious targets to become carbon neutral by 2050 and to help eliminate plastic waste. Mr. Davis, the company’s independent lead director, has significant experience in corporate governance and public company management as current and former CEO of large public companies and as a director on other public company boards. The Board recognizes that the leadership structure and combination or separation of the CEO and chairman roles are driven by the needs of the company. As a result, no policy exists requiring combination or separation of leadership roles. This determination is made on an annual basis by the Board, which allows the Board the flexibility to make changes to Board leadership that are in the best interests of the company and its stockholders. As a part of that process, the Board reviews whether the existing leadership structure provides strong independent oversight while balancing the need for extensive knowledge of business operations, risks and strategy implementation, and accountability for company performance. Regardless of the specific Board leadership structure, the company has always incorporated a strong defined leadership role for an independent director. The Board believes that its independence and effective oversight of management is enabled through the company’s strong corporate governance practices and safeguards currently in place, including the election of a separate lead director with significant responsibilities, the use of executive sessions, the Board’s robust Committee structure with each Committee composed of independent directors and chaired by an independent director, and annual review of the leadership structure. For more information, see Board Leadership Structure on pages 28-30 of the 2022 Proxy Statement  filed with the SEC on March 4, 2022. Also see the Governance Chapter within this report. 102-24 Nominating and selecting the highest governance body The Corporate Governance Committee has responsibility for reviewing and recommending director nominees for membership on the Board. The Corporate Governance Committee recommends to the Board guidelines to evaluate candidates for Board membership to provide for a diverse and highly qualified Board that, as a whole, reflects a broad range of viewpoints, experiences and expertise. The Corporate Governance Committee requires including diverse candidates in its initial director search list based on self-identified factors such as age, race, gender or sexual identity, ethnicity, culture and nationality. Minimum qualifications for any director candidates include: strong values and discipline, high ethical standards, a commitment to full participation on the Board and its Committees, relevant career experience, and a commitment to inclusion and diversity. Candidates should possess individual skills, experience and demonstrated abilities that help meet the current needs of the Board, such as experience or expertise in some of the following areas: the specific industries in which the company operates, issues affecting global businesses, science and technology, finance and/or economics, corporate governance, public policy, government affairs and prior government service, environmental and/or social impact experience, and experience as chief executive officer, chief operating officer, chief financial officer or other senior leader of a major company. Other factors that are considered are independence of thought, willingness to comply with Director stock ownership guidelines, meeting applicable Director independence standards (where independence is desired) and absence of conflicts of interest. The slate of director nominees to be submitted for stockholder vote at the Annual Meeting of Stockholders and to fill any vacancies on the Board are to be determined in accordance with the Bylaws.\n",

The Board is also responsible for overseeing the ESG priorities of the company, ensuring transparency and accountability. Each Committee is responsible for oversight of specific strategic and ESG areas relevant to their respective charters.

Although each Committee oversees the management of certain responsibilities as described above, the full Board is regularly updated by the Committees, management and senior leaders. This enables the Board and the Committees to coordinate oversight and the relationships among the various priorities of the company. The Board delegates the day-to-day management of the company, including setting the values and mission of the company and execution of strategic and ESG priorities, to Dow’s CEO and other senior leaders and provides guidance to and oversight of management.

All new directors participate in a robust orientation to familiarize directors with the company’s strategic priorities, corporate and business plans, significant financial, accounting and risk management issues, and governance policies and compliance processes, including the Code of Conduct. On an ongoing basis, directors receive materials or briefing sessions regarding the operations of the company, strategic priorities, ESG initiatives and risks. Each regularly scheduled Board meeting includes a spotlight session on key enterprise priorities where internal and/or external experts provide in-depth presentations to directors. In 2021, presentations were made on the topics of: ESG performance and valuation creation outcomes, decarbonization, political trends, climate and carbon policy, and global competitiveness. While some in-person activities have been paused during the COVID-19 pandemic, site and facility tours have resumed on a limited basis as health and safety guidelines permit. In 2021, directors were invited to tour the innovation lab in Midland, Michigan, and the manufacturing facility in Freeport, Texas. Directors are encouraged to attend appropriate continuing education programs to help them stay current on corporate governance, Board best practices, financial and accounting practices, ethical issues for directors and management, and similar matters relating to service on a public company board. 102-28 Evaluating the highest governance body’s performance The self-evaluation process is an effective tool in ensuring sound corporate governance practices, which are important to the success of the company’s business and in advancing stockholder interests. As provided in the Corporate Governance Guidelines, Board Committee Charters and the New York Stock Exchange listing standards, the Board and each of its Committees are required to conduct an annual self-evaluation of its performance with a particular focus on overall effectiveness. The self-evaluation process provides valuable insight regarding areas of effectiveness and opportunities for improvement. For more details about the evaluation process and an example of action taken, see the Board and Committee Evaluation Process Section (Page 38) in the 2022 Proxy Statement filed with the SEC on March 4, 2022. 102-29 Identifying and managing economic, environmental and social impacts The Board is the highest governance body involved in risk management through Dow’s Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) process. See GRI 102-30 Effectiveness of risk management processes for further description of this process and governing bodies involvement. Dow’s ERM process is responsible for identifying significant or major risks to the company and creating action plans to mitigate risks. On an annual basis, the ERM process screens risks from a broad range of inputs, both internal and external to Dow. Risks assessed as part of the annual ERM process include risks with economic, environmental and social impacts. All risks are reviewed and categorized based on potential impact and likelihood of a significant event occurring. Each risk is assigned to a member of Dow’s Executive Leadership Team (ELT) and an internal subject matter expert for mitigation plan accountability, if needed. The results of the annual ERM process are reviewed with Dow’s ELT – a diverse, cross-functional team representing each of Dow’s businesses, functions and geographic regions. Key risks that have specified mitigation actions are reviewed more regularly in leadership team meetings. In addition, risks can be re-evaluated based on several factors including changes in the external and macroeconomic environment, concerns identified by senior leaders or Dow’s Board, or through detection in Dow’s internal work processes. The Audit Committee of the Board has oversight of the ERM process, including an annual review of the ERM results as well as the policies and processes used to assess, monitor and control risks. Specific risks are also reviewed with the Environment, Health, Safety & Technology Committee, Compensation and Leadership Development Committee, Corporate Governance Committee and/or the full Board.\n",

The SEAC brings external insights such as views on biodiversity, environmental justice or changes in the sustainability landscape in China. Our ELT will use this information to inform our strategy. We use several elements to identify and prioritize risks and opportunities, including a sustainability materiality assessment, a stakeholder engagement process (See GRI 102-47 List of material topics ) and the ERM process. Risk management is a strategic activity within Dow, and our ability to manage risk creates opportunity as well. 102-30 Effectiveness of risk management processes Risk management is considered a strategic priority within the company. The Board is responsible for overseeing overall risk management for the company, including review and approval of the ERM approach and process implemented by management to identify, assess, manage and mitigate risk. Each Committee is responsible for oversight of specific risk areas relevant to their respective charters. The risk management approach and process are reviewed at least annually with key risks regularly evaluated at meetings of the Committees and Board, including risks with economic, environmental and social impacts. See Board’s Role in the Oversight of Risk Management (Pages 33-34) in the 2022 Proxy Statement filed with the SEC on March 4, 2022. 102-31 Review of economic, environmental, and social topics Dow held six Board meetings and the Committees of the Board collectively held 27 meetings for a total of 33 meetings in 2021.

The Board and management review the company’s short- and long-term strategic priorities throughout the year and dedicate time at each Board meeting for appropriate discussion. ERM is considered a strategic priority within the company. Responsibility for managing risk rests with executive management and the ELT while the Audit Committee provides oversight. The ERM process is conducted and reviewed at least annually, with key risks that have specified mitigation actions reviewed more regularly in leadership team meetings and with the Committees and Board, including risks with economic, environmental and social impacts. As needed, the Board receives timely updates from management and senior leaders on material matters of critical concern for the enterprise.\n",

At the 2021 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, 94% of the votes cast by stockholders supported Dow’s executive compensation programs. In the 2022 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, 91% of the votes cast by stockholders supported Dow’s executive compensation programs. The Board and management team carefully consider the advisory vote, as well as engagement with stakeholders throughout the year, when reviewing business, corporate governance and executive compensation profiles. For example as a result of stakeholder engagement, we made the decision to enhance the link between ESG metrics and executive compensation by including performance metrics related to Dow’s sustainability targets, including climate and carbon goals, in our Performance Share Unit program design. For additional information, see Key Executive Compensation Practices (Page 66) in the 2022 Proxy Statement filed with the SEC on March 4, 2022. 102-38 Annual total compensation ratio Based upon the calculation of compensation for both the CEO and the median employee, the ratio of CEO pay to median employee pay for 2021 was approximately 260:1.

      "REPORTING & DISCLOSURE TRACKING OUR PROGRESS DOW | REPORTING & DISCLOSURE | 103 Dow Disclosures – GRI Content Index Customer Engagement Customers are engaged frequently throughout the year through events, meetings, emails, surveys and social media. Dow uses Customer Experience surveys as a main source of soliciting insight annually from our customers and distributors. Surveys are sent to any direct customer or distributor contact who has interacted with us over the previous 12 months at any touchpoint along the customer journey. The contact is asked about their overall experience working with Dow during that time. This provides us with the Customer Experience Index (CXi). More interaction-specific questions related to the contact’s specific role are also asked to gain further insights around their online and offline experiences with Dow. In addition to the Customer Experience surveys, Dow teams regularly engage with our customers directly. We reinforce accountability and transparency across the company by including a CXi component to our Executive Compensation and employee Performance Award programs, recognizing that customers are critical to Dow’s success and every employee has an impact on customer loyalty. Year-end performance on the CXi score was 72 points, a decline of 5 points from 2020. Factors that impacted these results include industry supply challenges due to significant weather events and the availability of both raw materials and logistics. Although our score declined year over year, the CXi results provide valuable insight that is enabling us to make necessary changes.

Dow also has several methods of engagement with our suppliers to advance our our strategy and ESG priorities: • Several efforts are underway to embed ESG into supplier engagement activities. ESG criteria will be integrated into all requests for proposals, tenders, contracts and supplier relationship management strategies. A key foundation of this is to enable Dow’s Purchasing team to access robust ESG data, placing sustainability as a meaningful metric in the decision-making matrix. • Dow partnered with Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP) to collect climate data on 100+ key suppliers. • Partnering with TfS, we engage with suppliers in a streamlined and strategic way, leveraging the work of our industry peers and contributing our own outlook on sustainability supply chains. Dow is also collaborating with groups like the World Business Council for Sustainable Development and World Economic Forum to develop robust methodologies for data sharing along supply chains, allowing Dow to access high-quality data from our suppliers and provide the same level of quality to our customers. • Dow’s Logistics Supplier Award Programs (S4TAR & DowGOL) are designed to encourage and recognize Dow’s logistics partners for excellent performance in the areas of safety, sustainability, social responsibility and service. Dow’s goal with logistics supplier awards is to drive operational and sustainability excellence by sharing and recognizing best practice with its supply chain partners. Employee Engagement Employees are engaged frequently throughout the year through surveys, emails, intranet postings, individual conversations, meetings, training and other mechanisms. • At least twice a year, employees are invited to provide input through our annual Voice “all employee” survey, and through quarterly pulse surveys. Topics on these surveys are focused on employee satisfaction with company strategic direction, inclusion, wellness and safety, tools and technology, and leader effectiveness. • An overall measure of Employee Experience – based on feelings of pride, inspiration and belonging – is tracked each quarter. • Employees may provide input and comment on Dow Connect (internal online news portal), through townhalls and through Q&As and quarterly “all employee” updates (Dow World News). • Numerous opportunities are provided for employees at all levels to provide input into ESG practices and strategy. All leaders with direct reports, as well as influential leaders, are engaged on a regular basis through our annual LEAD programming. This program kicks off the year with a virtual conference covering company strategy and priorities, and in-depth discussions with internal and external experts on key topics such as Reliability, People and Culture, and Sustainability. During quarterly broadcasts for leaders, there is time for Q&As with the ELT. In addition, when there are timely topics, special forums are hosted for leaders to hear about the updates, ask questions and discuss. During the past year, some topics that have been influenced by direct employee input and the above listening mechanisms include the company’s work flexibility approach (Design your Day), updates to leave policies (parental, ERG and Volunteerism time-off), and wellness offerings.\n",

Wider communication with communities is through social media. Dow is committed to building resilient communities to address unmet needs while keeping our employees and communities safe. Across the Dow world, the majority of all Dow sites implement local community engagement programs. • Dow employees work closely with nonprofit partners, including local United Way chapters, to understand the hardships of individuals and families that live in or near poverty, to identify and prioritize resources. • In 2021, we launched a Community Opinion and Needs Assessment initiative, designed to inform Dow with data-based and objective insights into the needs of strategic Dow communities (defined as cities near important Dow manufacturing facilities). Twelve communities were surveyed in North America in the second half of 2021, with results available in first quarter of 2022. The assessment will be administered in Latin America and Europe in first quarter of 2022, with results available in second quarter of 2022. • Community Advisory Committees (CACs) are active at key Dow sites to obtain community perceptions about Dow, share Dow product and technology information, and understand how Dow can improve collaboration with community partners to address community needs. Regulator Engagement Dow engages with regulators as part of normal operations through in-person and online meetings and public comments. These engagements range from standard sharing of information and reporting to more detailed conversations about specific regulatory issues of interest. Engagement with regulators globally throughout 2021 was done primarily via email and online meetings and, where there was a topic of broader interest across companies, some occurred with our trade associations or other coalitions. During 2021, many topics were covered in regulator interactions, including (but not limited to): operating permits; environmental remediation projects; trade and customs regulations; product registrations; safe shipment, labeling, handling and use of our products; tax; data privacy; labor and workforce matters.\n",

      "REPORTING & DISCLOSURE TRACKING OUR PROGRESS DOW | REPORTING & DISCLOSURE | 118 Dow Disclosures – GRI Content Index GRI 207: Tax 2019 NOTE: Tax is not a material topic for Dow, as determined by our ESG materiality assessment. We are providing some perspective in this report for those stakeholders who have an interest in this topic. 207-103 Management approach See GRI 103 Management Approach (General) 207-1 Approach to tax We pay taxes globally, making significant contributions to the communities and countries in which we operate. With activity in over 60 countries, we take our obligations seriously and pay substantial income taxes, sales taxes, value added taxes, excise taxes, property taxes and other taxes and duties to local and national governments. Dow’s policy is to be lawful, ethical and socially responsible in all business practices, including our tax policy. Our obligations to stockholders, employees and the communities in which we operate are critical to our success and therefore we are guided by the following tax policy principles: • Economic Substance. Dow’s customers and related market demands determine where we operate, earn profits and therefore where we pay taxes. Proximity to customers and the global supply chain is critical to our ability to operate safely and profitably. Our transfer pricing policies are intended to reflect the economic substance of our global footprint and the activities being performed in each jurisdiction. We undertake transactions for commercial and business purposes, not for the sole purpose of reducing taxation. We interpret the tax laws and regulations with the understanding of the underlying policy and commercial transactions to which they are meant to apply. • Compliance and Reporting. Dow is committed to the highest level of tax compliance and reporting. We file returns, financial statements and disclosures that accurately state our income, costs and other relevant items in all the countries and jurisdictions in which we operate. Compliance means paying the right amount of tax, in the right place, at the right time and involves disclosing all relevant facts and circumstances to the tax authorities and claiming relief and incentives where available. Dow discloses expanded information on revenue, income before taxes and taxes in footnotes to its financial statements. Ever-evolving tax reporting requirements have driven Dow’s ongoing investment in technology enabling improved tax compliance and reporting. • Governance. See GRI 207-2 Tax governance, control and risk management. Dow’s Code of Conduct specifies each employee’s expectations at Dow and our approach to tax aligns with these standards. Furthermore, Dow has a Code of Financial Ethics that applies to the principal executive officer, principal financial officer, principal accounting officer and controllers. Both codes are publicly available here: • Code of Conduct | Business | Legal | Dow Corporate • Code of Financial Ethics | Dow Code of Conduct | Dow Corporate  The overall tax strategy and policy are reviewed by Dow’s Audit Committee at least annually. The following information is publicly available on Dow.com: • Trade and Tax | Public Policy | Dow Corporate : Global policy. • UK Tax Strategy 2021 | Public Policy | Dow Corporate  This document was developed for the United Kingdom; however, it reflects the company’s global strategy and principles. 207-2 Tax governance, control and risk management At Dow, we have strong internal controls and procedures that govern our tax processes and lower our risk profile, and we have committed the necessary resources to ensure that we are adhering to the highest ethical standards and delivering value to Dow and its stockholders.\n",
      "REPORTING & DISCLOSURE TRACKING OUR PROGRESS DOW | REPORTING & DISCLOSURE | 119 Dow Disclosures – GRI Content Index Our global tax organization is led by our chief tax officer, and consists of approximately 190 experienced accountants, lawyers and other tax professionals across the globe. We also commit the resources to seek the advice and counsel of tax experts around the world when necessary. Approach Toward Tax Planning Tax planning is an important element of Dow’s overall business strategy. Dow’s Tax Planning team works closely with the businesses and functions to support reasoned and compliant structures that complement the way Dow operates in each jurisdiction. Our global tax organization provides critical jurisdictional perspective into all planning decisions, giving Dow a strategic advantage compared to a more centralized tax organization. To support Dow in complying with its tax policy, advice from external service providers may be sought in relation to tax planning or complex circumstances. In cases where the tax guidance is unclear or Dow does not feel it has the necessary internal expert knowledge to assess the tax consequences adequately, external advice may be sought to support Dow’s decision-making process. Dow acts in accordance with the international guidelines (such as Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) guidelines) in its application of transfer pricing and aligns with the arm’s length principle on intercompany transactions. We engage outside consultants to assist in determining appropriate intercompany rates and continually review local requirements to ensure ongoing compliance. Level of Tax Risk Accepted Given the size and complexity of our business and the volume of tax obligations, tax risk arises from time to time relative to the interpretation of tax laws and the nature of our compliance measures. Dow has strong internal controls and procedures in place to minimize risk in reporting, compliance and other areas of tax application. Dow analyzes the tax consequences of transactions and events. When appropriate, we consult with outside counsel and other advisors. The following are examples of areas analyzed frequently: • Acquisitions, dispositions, joint ventures, restructurings and other transactions resulting in a gain or loss. • Significant changes in transfer pricing practices or operating profile. • Changes in tax accounting methods or policies. • Audit adjustments or unfavorable decisions in tax administrative appeals or litigation. • Other significant events that could negatively affect the reputation of Dow or its Board. Dow employees can report concerns about potential unethical tax behavior by following our Dow Code of Conduct described in GRI 102-16 Values, principles, standards, and norms of behavior and 102-17 Mechanisms for advice and concerns about ethics. 207-3 Stakeholder engagement and management of concerns related to tax Approach to Engagement with Tax Authorities We engage tax authorities with honesty, integrity, respect and fairness, and in a spirit of cooperative compliance. Dow seeks to resolve any disputed matters through proactive and transparent discussion and negotiation but is prepared to litigate or exercise alternative rights to defend our position. Where we disagree with a ruling or decision of a tax authority, Dow’s aim is to be professional, constructive and maintain transparent disclosure in our relationships with tax authorities, recognizing that early resolution of risks is in the best interests of Dow and tax authorities. Dow makes its tax returns as clear as possible and we try to raise important issues proactively so that tax authorities can focus their resources effectively. From time to time, if it is unclear how a tax law should be applied, we may engage with tax authorities in advance of undertaking transactions to confirm the correct application of such tax law. Tax laws are highly complex and, if our interpretation of the law differs from that of the tax authority, we seek to resolve the differences in a professional, timely manner or pursue dispute resolution, if appropriate.\n",
      "REPORTING & DISCLOSURE TRACKING OUR PROGRESS DOW | REPORTING & DISCLOSURE | 120 Dow Disclosures – GRI Content Index Approach to Public Policy and Advocacy At Dow, we believe that good tax policy fosters economic stability and better lives for people around the world. We advocate for pro-growth tax policies that establish and maintain competitive tax rates with a focus toward simplifying and harmonizing tax laws around the world. 207-4 Country-by-country reporting We advocate for tax policies and principles on our own behalf and through trade organizations. Our engagement with trade organizations and policy makers is based on the drive to sustainable tax policies that avoid disadvantaging certain taxpayers to the benefit of others. Our overriding goal is a level playing field for all taxpayers, no matter the jurisdiction or taxpayer size. Regarding GRI 207-4, we do not disclose country-by-country information, rather aggregated numbers by region – See disclosure GRI 201-1 Direct economic value generated and distributed.

GRI 300: Environmental Standards GRI 301: Materials 2016 301-103 Materials management approach See also: GRI 103 Management Approach (General) and GRI 102-9 Supply Chain How Materials Are Managed and Evaluated Dow is continuously striving to work more efficiently with the raw materials we purchase. Raw material efficiency (RME) is tracked as part of the suite of four metrics that comprise the Environmental Stewardship Index under our World-Leading Operations (WLO) Performance Goal. This includes improving process yield, improved tracking, better upstream quality control and waste minimization through all operations. RME is a measurement that determines the conversion of raw materials to products for operating facilities. Raw material losses due to process inefficiencies, waste production or flaring are a significant cost to Dow, but are inherent in many technologies. We strive to ensure RME initiatives are optimized in each facility to maximize profitability and to minimize environmental impact. To manage RME, sites implement an RME value creation program with a vision to improve the conversion of raw materials into finished products across Dow. This is accomplished by understanding the financial value of RME opportunities or gaps, using this information when technology centers set goals and assign resources, and tracking the improvements. This is more than a focus just on yield as has been done in the past, it also includes obtaining a broader understanding of the financial impact of raw material efficiency optimization. Raw material losses can also occur due to many other factors such as quality events and supply chain management. RME initiatives should be optimized in each facility to maximize profitability. A small improvement in raw material efficiency has a very large impact on Dow’s earnings, therefore RME is a potential opportunity for every business to reduce cost of sales and thereby expand margins. The RME management system is evaluated at least annually to determine if RME improvement activities should be a focus area for that particular technology. This is completed as part of the Business Manufacturing Technology and/or Technology Leadership group meetings. Additionally, on a quarterly basis progress against annual RME goals is monitored as part of our WLO performance goal.\n",
      "REPORTING & DISCLOSURE TRACKING OUR PROGRESS DOW | REPORTING & DISCLOSURE | 121 Dow Disclosures – GRI Content Index Management Approach Components Description Commitments We are committed to achieving at least a 1% year-over-year improvement in our RME index from a 2015 baseline every year until 2025. It is expected that most technologies will have defined activities and goals around RME, but it is understood that optimizing RME for some technologies may not be a critical profitability metric based on their current performance against theoretical best. The key is that each technology organization understands the opportunity and utilizes the information in annual goal planning. Targets Dow will improve its raw material efficiency utilization index by 10% relative to the 2015 baseline. Responsibilities Each Business Manufacturing Technology Leader is expected to ensure the following actions occur for their technology: • An RME measurement system is developed that is meaningful to the particular technology. • An RME focal point (typically called Yield Focal Point) is assigned that can work with the plants to understand the potential RME opportunities. • The economics and financial value of RME opportunities or gaps are determined and value is tracked. • Each Envelope Leader approves the RME goals and plans set by the technology. • RME savings is tracked quarterly, aligned to Innovative Technology Strategy Operations element. Specific Actions • Since 2015, Dow has enabled approximately $300MM in raw materials savings through efficiency improvements. These savings are primarily attributed to effective catalyst management across several technologies, reliable operations leading to minimized flaring and reduced natural gas purchases. 301-1 Materials used by weight or volume Renewable Materials In addition to fossil-based resources, Dow employs renewable raw materials based on wood, sugar cane, corn, grains and vegetable oils, among others, preferentially as byproducts from other industrial processes. In 2021, Dow purchased approximately 420KT* of renewable materials. These materials are used across a large portfolio of products across our businesses. The renewable raw materials are also used to directly substitute fossil-based resources using the mass balance approach, allowing us to allocate renewables in a wide variety of products. Dow works closely with our suppliers to ensure that our renewable raw materials are ethically sourced and do not come with negative effects such as deforestation, displacing local communities or harm to biodiversity, while expanding the positive gains such as – for example – reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. * New methodology and data capture has been deployed providing 420KT as the minimum number of renewable materials identified in 2021. OMISSION 301-1 Non-renewable volume is unavailable Information not available. We will continue to annually assess mechanisms to be able to report this information in the future.\n",
      "REPORTING & DISCLOSURE TRACKING OUR PROGRESS DOW | REPORTING & DISCLOSURE | 122 Dow Disclosures – GRI Content Index 301-2 Recycled input materials used In 2021, our baseline year, Dow purchased approximately 10,000 metric tons of recycled input materials in the form of – among others – used mattresses, used oils and mechanically recycled plastics. It is our strategy to increase the number of recycled inputs significantly from the 2021 baseline. To achieve this, Dow is expanding our recycling efforts through internal innovation, partnerships and scaling of production. We work on new technologies; new value chain ecosystems and we improve the recyclability of the products we sell so that the value chain can more easily bring them back to us for another cycle. At Dow we develop a broad variety of technologies to maximize the types of recyclable materials, quality of materials and resource efficiency of the recycling processes. This aligns with a key part of our Stop the Waste target, which is to enable 1 million metric tons of plastic to be collected, reused or recycled on an annual run-rate basis by 2030 through investing and/or collaborating in key technologies and infrastructure. In 2021, that value was approximately 23,000 metric tons. OMISSION 301-2 Percentage of total input materials used The information is not available as percent of total input. We will continue to annually assess mechanisms to be able to report this information in the future. 301-3 Reclaimed products and their packaging materials To accelerate circularity progress, we are also committed to redesigning and promoting reusable or recyclable packaging applications, so that by 2035, we are enabling 100% of our products sold into packaging applications to be reusable or recyclable. OMISSION 301-3 Reclaimed products and their packaging materials Information not available. We do not measure the quantity of products and packaging materials reclaimed. GRI 302: Energy 2016 302-103 Energy management approach 2016 & 305-103 Emissions management approach 2016 See also: GRI 103 Management Approach (General) In the short- to medium-term timeframe (<10 years), energy and emissions are managed through a combination of technological, commercial and operational activities. Reducing energy consumption and increasing the proportion of alternative energy sources in our energy portfolio, such as renewable power, are examples of key elements of our strategy to manage energy and emissions. As Dow operates mature, capital-intensive assets, energy and emissions are also evaluated and managed on long-term timelines (10+ years) involving multi-decade assessments of global energy consumption, fuel and electricity prices, regulatory drivers and technology trends. Long-term, Dow’s management of energy and emissions at an asset level involves replacing end-of-life capacity with higher efficiency, lower-emission assets, as well as efforts to scale carbon-efficient economical technologies not yet available for widespread deployment today, such as e-cracking. As all Dow employees play a role in energy and emissions management, the Annual Performance Awards for all Dow employees and executive compensation programs are based not only on financial performance, but also on progress toward our sustainability goals, including our energy, emissions and climate-related targets. An overview of Dow’s 2021 Annual Performance Award Design and Metrics can be found on page 8 of the 2022 Proxy Statement  filed with the SEC on March 4, 2022.\n",
      "REPORTING & DISCLOSURE TRACKING OUR PROGRESS DOW | REPORTING & DISCLOSURE | 123 Dow Disclosures – GRI Content Index Scope 3 emissions are another critical component of Dow’s climate impact, and thus are a key element of Dow’s climate strategy. Dow has assessed Scope 3 emissions and developed a strategy to track and reduce known hotspots, or areas with higher GHG emissions, and to gain additional information on blind spots, or areas where data may be uncertain or challenging to collect. Through this approach, we can progress on the areas of most pressing concern while still working to better understand others. By collaborating directly with our suppliers as well as with industry groups and NGOs, we can advance Scope 3 decarbonization while also developing simplified and streamlined methodologies for data sharing. Focus areas include: • Purchased Goods & Services and Transportation – By relating the emissions values used in our Scope 3 accounting with the purchases from our suppliers, Dow can estimate which suppliers are most relevant to consider in Dow’s climate strategy. These suppliers will be Dow’s primary focal point for outreach to encourage climate goal setting, advance collaborative decarbonization projects and improve carbon accounting practices. See GRI 308-103 Supplier Environmental Assessment for additional detail. • One key element of better understanding our suppliers’ GHG emissions and progress toward reduction is the sharing of product carbon footprint data, or the emissions intensity of the goods or services these companies provide to Dow. Many companies are just beginning to build out their programs for calculating product carbon footprints, while smaller companies may lack the capacity altogether to collect and share this information. See GRI 305-3 Other indirect (Scope 3) GHG emissions for additional details. Management Approach Components Description Commitments Dow supports the Paris Agreement and its goal to keep global temperature rise to well below 2°C and to pursue efforts to limit the increase to 1.5°C. Consistent with this commitment, we have set an ambitious target of being carbon neutral by 2050 (Scope 1+2+3 plus product benefits). We have also set a medium-term goal to reduce our net annual carbon emissions by 5 million metric tons by 2030 versus our 2020 baseline (15% reduction). This builds upon an already achieved 15% emissions reduction since 2005 (~30% total reduction by 2030 vs. 2005). Our emissions- reduction targets are scientifically-based and in alignment with, and ahead of, the International Energy Agency’s 2050 Net Zero Emissions Scenario for the chemical industry. Our ability to meet these commitments, while enabling business growth, will require effective management of our energy consumption and the implementation of new technologies. In addition, we will need the appropriate infrastructure and policy developments to support emissions reductions; Dow is actively engaged in constructive advocacy to advance pragmatic policies to enable a successful path to zero. Targets • By 2030, Dow will reduce its net annual carbon emissions by 5 million metric tons versus our 2020 baseline (Scope 1+2 15% reduction). • By 2050, Dow intends to be carbon neutral (Scope 1+2+3 plus product benefits). • Dow will obtain 750 MW of its power demand from renewable sources by 2025. • Dow is committed to efficient operations that drive environmental benefits for our communities and the world. Dow will grow, but offset emissions of Priority Compounds, volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and nitrogen oxides (NOx).\n",

Since 2014, we have held ourselves accountable to the principles defined by the Responsible Care® global charter that addresses ongoing stakeholder expectations and evolving challenges. These principles apply to Dow globally and are managed through the implementation and compliance with our internal Operating Discipline Management System (ODMS). In certain locations where Dow operates an iPark, the water withdrawal and consumption will account for both Dow’s and third-party water requirements. The process for setting water-related targets is an integral part of our water management approach put forth by recognizing the need of other water users within the basin and the local context of each area with water stress. This water stress methodology provides a path to help justify risk minimization and drive implementation of key mitigation measures. Dow’s water stress methodology aims to: • Evaluate water stress using a global tool such as Aqueduct published by the World Resource Institute (WRI) and translate into a business risk for Dow by looking at the site’s overall water intake, virgin freshwater intake and production. The Aqueduct tool is also used to highlight future risk (timeframe of 2030 & 2040). • Discern the nature of the water problem(s) (volume reliability, quality or both). • Validate key problem/root cause in consultation with the sites. • Establish a prioritized list of sites identified as key water-stressed sites (KWSS) for Dow. • Establish overall water stress action plan to drive freshwater intake reduction as KWSS. Dow’s six KWSS, which all comply with ISO 14001-2015 standards, include: • Brazos River, Freeport, Texas • Guadalupe River, Seadrift, Texas • Purchased fresh water, Bahia Bianca, Argentina • Rivers Rhine and Meuse, Terneuzen, the Netherlands • River Weisse Elster and Lake Witznitz (Böhlen site), Dow Central Germany • Purchased freshwater supply source from Ebro River diversion, Tarragona, Spain As Dow operates mature, capital-intensive assets, water consumption and effluents are evaluated and managed on long-term timelines (10+ years) involving multi-decade assessments. These assessments include water withdrawals, consumption and availability, costs associated with water withdrawal and treatment, regulatory drivers and technology trends. In the short- to medium-term timeframe (<10 years), water withdrawals and effluents are managed through a combination of technological, commercial and operational activities. Key elements of our strategy to manage water include: • Avoid additional water withdrawals and effluents. • Reduce water consumption. • Increase the proportion of water reused or recycled both internally and externally. • Advance treatment of effluents that support reduction of water consumption and discharge, understanding our responsibility at a watershed level, and define and drive impactful collective action measures to improve health of watersheds.\n",
      "REPORTING & DISCLOSURE TRACKING OUR PROGRESS DOW | REPORTING & DISCLOSURE | 129 Dow Disclosures – GRI Content Index Long-term, Dow’s management of water and effluents involves strategic implementation of higher-efficiency, lower-energy and water-consumption assets, and improved water treatment technologies. Other areas of water management include: • Dow’s supplier water assessments – See GRI 308-103 Supplier Environmental Assessment for additional details. • Our research and development portfolio assessment process prioritizes sustainability elements such as benefits and impacts to water and driving innovation in water consumption and effluents. • Dow collaborates with customers to help them with their respective water stewardship efforts. • Our product stewardship team develops handling guides and training materials for our customers on safe handling practices to minimize potential impacts to watersheds. • Additionally, we routinely evaluate the potential hazard of chemicals to the aquatic environment. Tools for these evaluations include aquatic toxicity and fate testing, computer modeling predictions and aquatic risk assessment. Dow’s internal auditing practices focus on the effectiveness of the water management approach. This includes Dow’s maintenance and reliability strategy for detecting leaks and losses of water, status of assets, and comparison against most-effective technologies, effectiveness of current metering strategy and possible water conservation opportunities. Additionally, Dow discloses our water impact via CDP. Management Approach Components Description Commitments Building on our commitment to U.N. Sustainable Development Goal 6 (SDG 6), Dow supports the CEO Water Mandate mobilizing businesses to advance water stewardship within our own operations and by collaboratively working to enhance water management at the watershed level. We are committed to progress against three elements: direct operations, supply chain and watershed management. By using our materials science to innovate products and processes, we help improve sustainable water management across our entire value chain. As signatories of the Water Resilience Pledge, we have established commitments to achieve the following by 2050, through both individual and collective actions: • Net positive water impact: Achieve a measurable and net positive impact in water-stressed basins on availability, quality and accessibility through industry-leading water operations and basin initiatives. • Water-resilient value chain: Develop, implement and enable strategies to support leading impact-based water resilience practices across the global value chain. • Global leadership: Raise the global ambition of water resilience through public and corporate outreach. Targets • As part of our WLO goal, Dow will reduce the freshwater intake intensity at key water-stressed sites by 20% by 2025. • Dow’s blueprint on sustainable watershed management (Sustainable Watershed Management | Dow 2025 Sustainability Goals |Dow Corporate ) establishes how collaboration can be a path to addressing water scarcity. • By 2025, Dow will deliver $1 billion in value through projects that are good for business and good for ecosystems including water filtration, water provisioning, flooding control and water quality. Responsibilities • Accountability of water management begins at the site level where the operating permits exist and elevates to the board level providing oversight of water-related issues. Additionally, each employee also has a vested interest in continued progress, linking sustainability performance to each individual Dow employee’s performance award.\n",
      "REPORTING & DISCLOSURE TRACKING OUR PROGRESS DOW | REPORTING & DISCLOSURE | 130 Dow Disclosures – GRI Content Index Specific Actions • Implemented water conservation projects equivalent to 2% of Freeport’s freshwater withdrawal associated with Dow production. Freeport accounts for roughly 80% of our overall freshwater intake intensity reduction goal. • In Terneuzen, the Netherlands, Dow is working with farmers and the regional water board to store fresh water underground – collecting it in the winter for use in the summer, so farmers can benefit in periods of drought. • In Böhlen, Germany, we are working through AquaSPICE on strategies to reshape our water use by improving recycling of various process water streams, treating rainwater via advanced wetlands, and creating the next level of site water management by using smart monitoring algorithms and controls on raw water, discharge and recycle streams. The project is aligned with the EU Green Deal. 303-1 Interactions with water as a shared resource Recognizing that water is a resource requiring shared action, Dow is working to advance water stewardship both within our own operations and at the watershed level to deliver improvements to water quantity, quality and accessibility. The various sources of water intake to each Dow facility depend on local availability. Most of our facilities withdraw from surface water bodies. In locations where seawater/ brackish water is readily available, such as at production facilities on the coast, it is used for one-pass cooling. Groundwater is used at very few Dow sites. Rainwater is recovered in multiple sites and used as firewater and for other purposes. Efforts to reuse and recycle water from both internal and external sources are put in place when economically and technically feasible. Several Dow sites purchase water from third-party sources in two forms – raw or treated surface water and as treated effluent wastewater. Dow also sells and treats water for tenants within our industrial parks (iParks). Most of our water is discharged as surface water, with a small portion returned to bays and oceans. At a few sites, Dow sends wastewater to be treated by a third party before discharge (typically to surface water). Rainwater and non-contact cooling waters are typically not treated or metered, although they are monitored for quality. Dow appropriately treats and monitors the quality of water discharged back to the environment. Dow works to eliminate or minimize the generation of emissions to water at the source through research, process design, plant operations and maintenance. Some of the key challenges associated with improving our performance in water stewardship include: • Complexity of water systems across our facilities and performing water measurements. • Large fluctuations associated with conveyance systems subject to weather. • Making the business case for water due to low cost of water. • Predicting water risks in a changing climate. • Risk management aligned with long-term capital planning. • High costs associated with aging infrastructure. Dow is engaged in many stakeholder feedback activities pertaining to water such as: • Community engagement driving watershed-level improvements using nature-based solutions, sharing technical advice and financial support. • Customers’ joint reviews and rating of Dow’s performance with respect to water risks. • External groups such as American Chemistry Council (ACC), World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD), The Nature Conservancy (TNC) and CEO Water Mandate where we actively develop collective actions, improve work process tools and develop best practices, overall guidance on water use and efficiency and waterbody risk stress assessment.\n",
      "REPORTING & DISCLOSURE TRACKING OUR PROGRESS DOW | REPORTING & DISCLOSURE | 131 Dow Disclosures – GRI Content Index 303-2 Management of water discharge-related impacts The management of water discharge-related impacts is governed by Dow’s ODMS and includes discharge directly to surface water bodies, subsurface water and third-party treatment entities. All Dow businesses, locations and facilities are required to develop a program that is consistent with the principles of Responsible Care®, company goals, and required external management systems, ISO-14001 as applicable, and comply with local applicable environmental licenses and permits. Employees must reduce the impacts to the environment by using appropriate work practices to prevent, report and mitigate releases to the environment. Management of wastewater includes handling, storage, containment, treatment (e.g., destruction) disposal and on-site transportation. Each external contractor or outside service provider used for treatment operations to recycle, recover, convert, treat, or contain wastewater must be approved and meet Dow’s ODMS surface water protection standard. As a Responsible Care ® company and member of the International Council of Chemical Associations, we are continually engaged in waste reduction and pollution prevention efforts in our operations, including those linked to water. Water discharge quality is strictly governed by local regulations, and each operating site is accountable for meeting the established permit discharge limits and has monitoring capability in place to meet these limits. Additionally, the responsible local authorities regularly audit our facilities and management program. See actions related to our water discharge within the Environmental/Climate/Water section of this report. 303-3 Water withdrawal Water is withdrawn from the natural environment and used for Dow’s industrial processes. However, only a small proportion of water withdrawn ends up in our products. 85% of source water is returned to the environment at equal or better quality than at withdrawal (for additional information see GRI 303-5 Water consumption). Total water intake accounting standards are owned and developed by the Waste and Emissions Reporting System (WERS) while each site is accountable to establish a methodology with associated assumptions.

GRI 304: Biodiversity 2016 304-103 Biodiversity Management Approach 2016 See also: GRI 103 Management Approach (General) As noted by Global Biodiversity Outlook 5/Convention on Biological Diversity, the loss of biodiversity has cascading consequences for businesses, for nature and for human society, including in the global economy, the availability of food and water, and human security, health and wellbeing. Biodiversity underpins nature’s ability to provide a variety of valuable services – such as clean air, clean water and healthy soil. Maintaining biological diversity is therefore directly tied to Dow’s business success across our value chain, from raw materials we purchase, to our global operations and to the use and end of life of our products. We have a responsibility to manage our business in a way that preserves and protects nature and its essential services to people.\n",
      "REPORTING & DISCLOSURE TRACKING OUR PROGRESS DOW | REPORTING & DISCLOSURE | 135 Dow Disclosures – GRI Content Index More specifically, we manage biodiversity in the following ways: Within our manufacturing sites • Within Dow’s operations our interactions with biodiversity occur through land use change, water intakes and effluents, air emissions and waste management tied to ecosystem integrity. • In the short- to medium-term timeframe (<10 years), biodiversity impacts are managed through a combination of technological, commercial and operational activities. The management principles governed by Dow’s Operating Discipline Management System are included in order of priority: avoid, reduce, reuse, regenerate, restore and transform. Avoiding new water withdrawals and effluents; reducing emissions contributing to climate impacts by purchasing renewable power; increasing the proportion of water reused both internally and externally; regenerating waste streams to reduce materials sent to landfills; and restoring parcels of lands within our manufacturing assets to native habitats are examples. • As Dow operates mature, capital-intensive assets, biodiversity impacts are also evaluated and managed on long-term timelines (10+ years) by including impacts (+/-) to nature as part of our capital allocation involving multi-decade assessments of water withdrawals; consumption and availability; costs associated with waste generation and treatment; biobased alternatives as raw material sources; regulatory drivers; and technology trends. Long-term, Dow’s management of biodiversity at an asset level involves replacing end-of-life equipment with higher- efficiency, lower-overall-environmental-footprint assets, as well as efforts to scale efficient economical technologies not yet available for widespread deployment today, such as carbon-neutral crackers. • We are taking an ecosystem approach to understand how our manufacturing assets fit within nature. We screen all projects for opportunities to use nature-based solutions that deliver not only the functionalities serving Dow’s purpose but often deliver additional co-benefits to nature and surrounding communities. Finally, we seek to work collectively with our neighbors, recognizing the flow of ecosystem services reaches beyond our properties. • As part of our WLO goals, Dow screens all capital projects for their environmental impacts, including an assessment of the extent of environmental disturbances. Our approach to the reclamation and restoration of lands disturbed by our operations is to adhere to all regional regulatory requirements. All disturbed land is restored to a condition that is appropriate for redevelopment or other reuse. Within our supply chain Dow has initiated efforts in defining potential issue areas and value chain locations for target setting with respect to biodiversity. Key efforts in 2021 include: • Promoting and strengthening best practices associated with biobased raw materials. We have screened 70% of the suppliers in the Latin America region for the use of biologically sourced materials. On a global level such screening initially prioritized the most relevant and high-volume raw materials but will be extended to lower volumes over the next few years. On a global level such screening initially prioritized the most relevant and high-volume raw materials but will be extended to lower volumes over the next few years. We have implemented several check points throughout the product creation cycle to identify biobased raw materials as early as possible. Such measures allow us to investigate the origin of the biobased material, as well as to identify and comply with any relevant national regulatory requirements. Dow colleagues have been trained on the Nagoya Protocol and national regulations on the protection of biodiversity from various functions around the globe: R&D, Legal, Marketing, Sustainability and Intellectual Property. • Initiating the roadmap for integrating biodiversity across Dow’s value chain. Dow’s Consumer Solutions business was chosen as the pilot for its direct extraction of raw materials, manufacturing and commercial activities in Brazil, the most biodiverse country in the world. Timber products, quartz, charcoal, coal and woodchips are raw materials purchased in the market and/or portion produced in our Natural Resources Operation in Brazil. Their management approach includes third-party auditing program of wood and charcoal; a certification of suppliers and Dow land management practices by a third party; a registration of timber production and an annual production/consumption plan administered by the local Secretariat of the Environment. • We are expanding the CDP supply chain program to include biodiversity. The data received will be used to prioritize key issues and specific geographical locations of concern. Ultimately this will enable Dow to design and implement a risk mitigation plan in collaboration with our key suppliers.\n",

We operate our facilities and work to minimize negative impacts on the land we own and occupy. Our remediation efforts are strictly managed and overseen by local authorities. Our methodology ensures we screen projects for opportunities to apply nature-based solutions that often deliver additional benefits tied to biodiversity. Some examples to highlight: • We have implemented sustainable landscaping practices promoting areas for enhanced biodiversity such as our Leuna site in Germany, where grass is only mowed when it is tied to a specific operational need. The remainder of the areas are left for nature. • We look for nature-based solutions to be integrated within our unit of operation such as Elizabethtown, Kentucky, where a wetland was built, as opposed to dry pond, to enhance the local habitat. • Portions of our green belt areas have been put into conservation such as our Bristol, Pennsylvania, facility, where 80 acres of wetland forest was sold to a local land trust (the Heritage Conservancy) for conservation in perpetuity. • Restoring an old ash pond into a wetland in Midland, Michigan. • Partnerships in organizations such as the Alliance to End Plastic Waste contribute to the preservation of biodiversity in bodies of water.

Additionally, for sites working under the European Union Emissions Trading System (EU ETS), Dow’s Scope 1 GHG emissions are externally assured. Overall, Scope 1 emissions decreased slightly in 2021 relative to 2020 supported by energy reduction projects such as flare gas reduction and other energy efficiency projects as listed in GRI 302-4 Reduction of energy consumption and GRI 305-5 Reduction of GHG Emissions.

For further information refer to GHG Protocol Disclosure Report. 2 Changes in methodology applied to 2021/2020 and that could not be applied 2019 due to significant burden. Scope 1 includes Kyoto Protocol greenhouse gases [carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O) and hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs)]. Dow does not have emissions of perfluorocarbons (PFCs), sulfur hexafluoride (SF6), or nitrogen trifluoride (NF3). Biogenic CO2 emissions in metric tons of CO2 equivalent were 0.5, with 2020 being the base year for the calculation. The source of Global Warming Potential factors is from the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Sixth Assessment Report: IPCC_AR6_WGI_Chapter_07. pdf  (GWP 100, Table 7.15 beginning on Page 7-124). Note: Assuming all methane is “fossil” using GWP 29.8. Results in conservative estimate, as not yet implementing use of methane non-fossil (GWP 27.2) for some sources (e.g., landfill, wastewater treatment plant, etc.). Dow uses the Greenhouse Gas Protocol Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard operational control approach for emissions. Additionally, we use a hierarchy approach for calculation methods (e.g., Regulatory, Analyzer, Emission Factors, etc.). 305-2 Energy indirect (Scope 2) GHG emissions Scope 2 emissions, baselined in 2020, reflect power purchases to supply manufacturing operations around the world. These are calculated according to the Greenhouse Gas Protocol Scope 2 Guidance, including both location-based and market-based methods. The Scope 2 emissions included in the corporate total used for tracking progress against Dow’s carbon emissions-reduction targets are calculated using the market-based method. For Scope 2 emissions, Dow requests, but does not verify, the factors used when data is received from our suppliers. We assume the most recent Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Control (IPCC) assessment report (AR6) 100-year GWP values for all data if not provided. We will continue to improve our understanding of the factors used from our suppliers to represent the information as accurately as possible in the future. The data below includes four of the seven GHG emissions covered by the UNFCCC/Kyoto protocol: carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O), and hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs).

      "REPORTING & DISCLOSURE TRACKING OUR PROGRESS DOW | REPORTING & DISCLOSURE | 141 Dow Disclosures – GRI Content Index In 2021, Dow’s Scope 2 emissions were reduced by approximately 400,000 metric tons CO2e (6.4% reduction) as a result of Dow’s efforts to source cleaner energy to support our sites. In 2021, we implemented sourcing of cleaner power agreements to support our operations in Europe, resulting in a material decrease in our Scope 2 emissions from 2020 to 2021 (see GRI 305-5 Reduction of GHG Emissions). We also laid the groundwork for further reductions in Scope 2 emissions through the addition of several renewable power agreements that will come into effect over the next few years: • In Latin America, Dow signed a long-term agreement in Brazil with Casa dos Ventos aligned to the construction of a new wind power plant in Rio Grande do Norte state. The agreement will provide Dow’s site in Cabangu, Brazil, with access to cost-competitive capacity for wind-generated electricity, which will supply power for silicon metal production. • In North America, a long-term agreement with Capital Power Corporation in Alberta, Canada, will provide wind power capacity, replacing approximately 40% of the energy demand at Dow’s Prentiss, Alberta, site for polyethylene production. In addition, Dow has signed an agreement with the Louisville Gas and Electric Company (LG&E) and Kentucky Utilities (KU) to supply solar power to Dow’s site in Elizabethtown, Kentucky, U.S. • In Europe, Dow has entered into a number of agreements over the past few years that have enabled Dow sites in Spain, U.K., Sweden, France and Germany to transition to 100% green electricity. The impact of this work can be seen in the reduction of Scope 2 emissions in 2021 and will contribute to additional Scope 2 reductions in 2022. Dow’s access to renewable power today has expanded to over 900 MW, surpassing Dow’s 2025 Sustainability Goal of obtaining 750 MW of its power demand from renewable sources. 305-3 Other indirect (Scope 3) GHG emissions Scope 3 emissions are defined by the Greenhouse Gas Protocol Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard as indirect emissions from value chain activities. Understanding the relative scale of Scope 3 emissions contributes to our strategies for targeting reduction initiatives. Total estimated Scope 3 emissions for 2021 were 77.64 million metric tons. The largest category of our Scope 3 emissions remains Scope 3.1, Purchased Goods & Services. Our estimates of Scope 3 emissions are made according to the Greenhouse Gas Protocol Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard and the Corporate Value Chain (Scope 3) Accounting and Reporting Standard, as well as the World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD) Guidance for Accounting and Reporting Corporate GHG Emissions in the Chemical Sector Value Chain and the Global Logistics Emissions Council (GLEC) Framework. Emissions factors applied in Scope 3 estimates include representative GHG emission inventories from Ecoinvent v3.8, economic input-output model factors, GLEC Framework carbon intensity factors, and others. Estimates include all or a subset of Kyoto GHGs [CO2, CH4, N2O, HFCs, PFCs, SF6, and NF3] depending on the product, activity, category and estimation methodology. Dow’s scope 3 emissions in 2021 are higher when compared to 2020 results and are driven by two primary factors. First, some variations were due to differences in Dow’s products or operations. Most significantly, an increase in emissions in category 3.11 Use of Sold Products, by approximately four million tons of CO2e was primarily tied to the growth in sales of hydrocarbon-based byproducts from Dow’s manufacturing processes that are used in fuel by downstream customers. Secondly, as part of our work to continuously improve the accuracy and comprehensiveness of our Scope 3 accounting, several of our improvements were implemented in this reporting cycle that are described below. The following changes improved accuracy and accounting systems without significantly varying the final values. • Across all categories, we refined emissions estimates by increasing the specificity of factors for materials and activities wherever possible. First, our estimates make use of region-specific emissions factors for materials where available. Second, we matched emissions factors as specifically as possible for material types and transportation, covering over 90% of purchased materials (by weight) and transportation (by ton-kilometer). • Improving accuracy by making better use of Dow’s primary data, such as the quantities of purchased goods and shipment weights, by building new tracking systems and reporting flows. • For 3.3 Fuel- and Energy-Related Activities, country-specific data was integrated for electricity grids and transmissions and distribution losses. • Dow is advancing the potential to embed supplier data for upstream Scope 3 categories in the future via engagements with suppliers as well as with the CDP Supply Chain Program and the WBCSD Carbon Transparency Pathfinder.\n",
      "REPORTING & DISCLOSURE TRACKING OUR PROGRESS DOW | REPORTING & DISCLOSURE | 142 Dow Disclosures – GRI Content Index In some cases, changes in methods or underlying data led to increases or decreases in a category’s emissions for 2021 when compared to 2020. • Improving the underlying data and emissions factors to calculate 3.4 Upstream Transportation and Distribution emissions resulted in a large variance compared to previous years. Historically, transportation emissions were calculated at a very high level, taking the gross weight by mode of transportation (MOT), a global carbon factor for the mode, and an average distance to generate a carbon footprint. In 2020, Dow’s Integrated Supply Chain team calculated transportation emissions at the shipment stage level. Gross weights were refined and validated across several reports and the distance measurement improved significantly across each mode of transport using GPS data, a port-to- port distance dataset, and the Great Circle Distance (GCD) calculation between origins and destinations. A GLEC Framework carbon intensity factor was applied to each Dow shipping type within the MOT based on region, vehicle characteristics and payload. This resulted in a much more granular and accurate calculation of Upstream Transportation emissions, resulting in a decrease of approximately 50% from 2020. • The increase in emissions in category 3.11 was primarily tied to the growth in sales of hydrocarbon-based byproducts from Dow’s manufacturing processes that are used in fuel by downstream customers. In addition, we included a carbon black feed in this category, which contributed a small but significant increase in downstream emissions. • The End-of-Life emissions in category 3.12 are due to an increase in revenue, which was used as a proxy to estimate the end-of-life emissions for sold products. In the future, we intend to move to actual production output data to improve accuracy.

These emissions were previously aligned to Downstream Transportation & Distribution. The company has revised all prior periods within this report to conform with the new presentation. Dow’s Scope 3 GHG emissions accounting will continue to evolve as the industry improves accounting methodologies and as value chain data becomes more widely available. In 2022 and 2023, Dow is advancing a baselining initiative to improve the accuracy and transparency of our scope 3 emissions. We are working to establish a coordinated approach to define a robust and trackable scope 3 climate target and path-to-zero roadmap that will allow us to demonstrate clear progress on our ‘decarbonize and grow’ commitment. The company has made specific commitments and created accountability towards reducing our value chain emissions by embedding Scope 3 milestones into our 2022- 2024 performance share long-term incentive compensation program as defined in the 2022 Proxy Statement  filed with the SEC on March 4, 2022. This includes establishing milestones for defining our Scope 3 emissions exposures by year-end 2023 for upstream Scope 3 categories 1, 3 and 4 2. Dow will engage with key suppliers through supplier relationship management activities and the CDP Supply Chain Program, requesting that they provide product carbon footprint data and set climate targets. GHG emissions intensity is calculated by taking the sum of the Scope 1 and 2 emissions data and dividing by production volume. The Scope 1 emissions value excludes emissions from power and steam not consumed by the company. The scope 2 value uses the market-based value. The production value used in this calculation is the total valued production volume. Dow observed an overall decrease in GHG emissions intensity relative to 2020 due to a decrease in Scope 1 and 2 emissions. 2 The 2022 Proxy notes category 9. Subsequent to the publication of the Proxy, the company re-aligned its transportation emissions from Category 9 – Downstream Transportation & Distribution to Category 4 – Upstream Transportation & Distribution to comply with the GHG Protocol.\n",

The waste is reviewed and placed into the appropriate waste disposal, recovery or recycling channel. This placement is based on chemical properties, physical state, local governmental regulation and hazard classification. Dow has implemented guidelines that align to this waste management hierarchy that minimizes the impact of waste and emissions on the environment. We first work to eliminate or minimize the generation of waste and emissions at the source through research, process design, plant operations and maintenance. Then we find ways to reuse and recycle materials. Next, unusable, or non-recyclable hazardous waste is treated before disposal to eliminate or reduce the hazardous nature and volume of waste. Treatment may include destruction by chemical, physical, biological or thermal means. Disposal of waste materials in landfills is considered only after all other options have been thoroughly evaluated. Dow manages environmental data for reporting within our waste inventory system, WERS. All manufacturing sites globally record their waste generated and disposal in the system annually. The data is reviewed at the facility level and then by global coordinators before being aggregated for corporate reporting. The evaluation approach ties to the fact that all Dow waste is recorded and monitored during the annual environmental reporting. This data is compared to the previous year’s quantities to ensure consistency and identify significant increases. This data is granular to the production plant level, allowing for identification of opportunities for waste reduction and recycling. In addition, the Dow value recovery team has specific targets to divert waste and coproduct streams away from disposal to secondary markets. Most Preferred Least Preferred Source reduction Use, reuse or recycle at or near the point of waste generation Use, reuse or recycle external to the site or company generating the waste Waste treatment Landfill Management Approach Components Description Commitments Dow’s adherence and commitment to the waste management hierarchy is applied in all waste decisions. Waste is characterized and then reviewed to identify recycle/reuse opportunities and, if necessary, treated as waste. Targets As part of our World-Leading Operations (WLO) Environmental Stewardship goal, our target is to reduce our waste intensity footprint by 20% by 2025. Responsibilities Implementation of the waste management hierarchy is the responsibility of the WLO team. Specific Actions Dow has implemented several programs to reduce waste at the source, specifically: • Waste Minimization VIP (Value Improvement Practice) – reducing waste produced through improved project design. All projects >$2MM have a mandatory waste and water minimization VIP review. Five such reviews were completed in 2021. • Value Recovery Team – directing material from disposal to external sales. • Environmental Stewardship Projects – support and promote projects supporting 2025 and beyond sustainability goals.\n",
      "REPORTING & DISCLOSURE TRACKING OUR PROGRESS DOW | REPORTING & DISCLOSURE | 146 Dow Disclosures – GRI Content Index 306-1 Waste generation and significant waste-related impacts Dow uses raw materials, purchased feedstocks, and additives and catalyst to produce chemical products. The high level of product integration and internal byproduct recycling allows Dow to minimize the amount of waste produced. In addition to produced chemicals, byproducts are also sold to secondary customers. These byproducts are used as downstream raw materials, blended into solvents and fuels, etc. Waste produced can be treated internally at Dow for energy recovery, incinerated or sent to a Dow- owned landfill. Waste can also be sent to external disposal facilities as a final option. Recycling Integration Raw Material Feedstocks Purchased Chemical Feedstocks Additives and Catalyst Product Chemicals Byproducts Waste The amount of waste generated by Dow is directly impacted by the quality of raw material, internal production efficiency, internal quality measurement and, finally, product specifications. The amount of impurities either entering or produced during chemical manufacture ultimately determines the amount of product, byproduct and waste produced from a chemical process. 306-2 Management of significant waste-related impacts Prevention of waste generation is impacted by several factors at Dow including strict raw material specification, testing and certification. High levels of integration allow byproduct streams that would be waste to be recycled or used as raw materials inside Dow. Waste downstream to customers is minimized by strict quality control of all Dow products. Purer chemical feeds result in less waste. Actions: • All suppliers are qualified and must meet global material specifications when working with raw material, additive, and/or purchased chemicals. Materials have certificates of analysis and are, in many cases, tested prior to receiving. • During the chemical production process, internal quality measurements are maintained to minimize waste. Quality of byproduct streams is monitored before transfer to integrated production facilities. • Product and byproduct streams sold outside of Dow must be approved by product stewards that ensure the final use meets governmental, health and regulatory requirements. • Quality of products is controlled by testing and ensuring that products sold meet the global product specifications. Material that does not meet the quality standard is recycled internally, sold to an approved secondary application or sent for disposal. • Dow products that may do not meet the final quality measures due to shelf-life limitations, slight quality issues, damaged packaging, surplus, etc. may be sold into approved secondary markets. These materials are thereby diverted from disposal but are subject to product steward final approval. • As an active member of Operation Clean Sweep ® (OCS), a program designed to prevent pellet, flake and powder loss to the marine environment, our plastics manufacturing and logistics facilities around the world are engaged in this important initiative to help achieve zero pellet loss. Waste sent outside of Dow is characterized, then transported to a certified waste disposal facility for destruction or landfill. All disposal facilities are certified by Dow using third- party auditing to ensure compliance with all appropriate governmental regulations. Only approved disposal methods and facilities can receive Dow waste.\n"

      "REPORTING & DISCLOSURE TRACKING OUR PROGRESS DOW | REPORTING & DISCLOSURE | 150 Dow Disclosures – GRI Content Index 307-1 Non-compliance with environmental laws and regulations Environmental proceedings are listed in Part I, Item 3 of the Dow Inc. Annual Report on Form 10-K ~ for the year ended December 31, 2021, filed with the SEC on February 4, 2022. GRI 308: Supplier Environmental Assessment 2016 308-103 Management Approach See also: GRI 103 Management Approach (General) Dow’s supply chain is vast and global, with more than 30,000 suppliers providing materials and services to Dow each year. As such, it is critical to ensure that our suppliers and, in turn, our suppliers’ suppliers, align to Dow’s ESG priorities and strategies. Dow selects and manages its suppliers based on a robust set of criteria, ranging from performance and economics to ESG factors. Engaging suppliers that prioritize environmental issues is critical for Dow. In the reporting year, suppliers were engaged on ESG factors through data collection, policies and guidelines like the Supplier Code of Conduct (Supplier Code of Conduct| Public Policy | Corporate), which stipulates the requirements related to Respect the Environment, Protect Health and Safety, and Protect Communities During Transportation. In addition, some Dow procurement selection processes include additional environmental criteria related to a certain sector or commercial area. Beginning in 2022, ESG criteria will be used for all sourcing decisions. The management, objectives and requirements for our suppliers and supplier evaluation include an evolving set of specific actions: 1. Inspiring Dow’s procurement staff and suppliers to learn more about sustainability issues via various training opportunities, share best practices on how to integrate sustainability into their activities, and to continuously identify new innovations and collaboration opportunities. 2. Working with suppliers to collect ESG data on an annual basis via programs like CDP and Ecovadis. Results are then integrated into supplier relationship management frameworks and improvement action plans. 3. Recognizing that our chemical supply chain management is a collaborative topic, Dow will use the Together for Sustainability (TfS) and Ecovadis partnership to expand our audit program for suppliers associated with potential ESG risks. 4. Finally, we seek continuous improvement, by not only lowering our supply chain’s environmental impact, but also by identifying new innovations to advance a low-carbon, circular and fair economy. These improvements are tracked through our supplier ESG data collection program, as well as through our success stories based on individual supplier engagements. In addition, Dow is continually monitoring our supply chain for potential ESG risks, flagging materials, regions or individual suppliers that could represent a negative environmental impact. On a high level, Dow considers the management approach effective when our suppliers are not associated with environmental claims or legal action. Management Approach Components Description Commitments Dow aims to leverage our supply chain to improve ecological and social outcomes and contribute to the transition to a more sustainable economy. Targets As part of our WLO goal, Dow will demonstrate a 50% improvement in a Transportation Stewardship Index through progress in incident-free performance, leading-edge programs to influence logistics and raw material suppliers, and risk reduction across the value chain by 2025.\n",
      "REPORTING & DISCLOSURE TRACKING OUR PROGRESS DOW | REPORTING & DISCLOSURE | 151 Dow Disclosures – GRI Content Index Responsibilities The management of supplier ESG is broad and encompassing. It begins with the need to embed sustainability into every purchase Dow makes, using ESG criteria as a decision-making factor and ensuring the suppliers agree to our Code of Conduct for Suppliers. Once on board as a supplier, ESG is integrated into supplier relationship management frameworks, such as advancing ESG topics during regular supply meetings, and measured via ESG data collection programs like CDP and Ecovadis. These engagements will form the foundation of Dow’s new Supplier ESG Program, launching in 2022, which will become the pathway through which Dow engages on ESG topics with suppliers. Specific Actions Dow’s most significant action was the launch of its multigenerational plan for Sustainable Procurement in 2021, evolving our ESG program from compliance to a culture that embeds sustainability as a strategic and financial advantage. Some key highlights of this initiative: • We updated our Supplier Code of Conduct. • 105 suppliers responded to our CDP Program request, and we are following up to address gaps. • We implemented a Supplier Dashboard to inform Dow decision-makers of Dow’s internal supplier ESG scores. • Launched multiple training sessions to support the rollout of this program. Dow began to monitor suppliers potentially associated with high greenhouse gas emissions via the CDP Supply Chain Program, allowing for visibility of our suppliers’ climate impacts and strategy over time, building on our continuous efforts to monitor our supply chain for environmental impacts. Continuing this journey, Dow will begin to request ESG data from suppliers associated with high spend and/or high ESG risk using the Ecovadis platform in 2022. 308-1 New suppliers that were screened using environmental criteria OMISSION 308-1 New Suppliers that were screened using environmental criteria Information not available.

      "REPORTING & DISCLOSURE TRACKING OUR PROGRESS DOW | REPORTING & DISCLOSURE | 157 Dow Disclosures – GRI Content Index Targets Annually, we set performance targets aligned with our sustainability metrics for health and safety. Elements include transportation safety, environmental stewardship, decrease in unplanned events, healthy culture improvement, reduced chronic health risks (e.g., noise), health improvement and occupational injury illness reduction. As part of our World-Leading Operations Goals, we have the following milestones: • Dow will strive to eliminate fatalities, significantly reduce severe injury and illness incidents, and maintain the total recordable injury and illness rate at industry-leading levels. • Dow will strive to eliminate all process safety events that impact our people, our communities and the environment. • Dow will strive to eliminate all preventable Motor Vehicle Accident (MVA) fatalities. • Dow will have a Total Worker Health ® (TWH) implementation that comprehensively controls workplace health risks, protects workers and improves the health of Dow people (Healthy Culture, Healthy Workplace, Healthy People). • Dow will demonstrate a 50% improvement in a Transportation Stewardship Index through progress in incident-free performance, leading-edge programs to influence logistics and raw material suppliers, and risk reduction across the value chain. • Dow will strive to eliminate severe transportation incidents that impact people, property and the environment in the communities through which our products, raw materials and intermediates flow. Responsibilities In addition to an Environmental, Health, Safety, and Sustainability (EHS&S) organization providing resources with expertise in occupational health and safety, additional roles are in place across business, manufacturing, research and supply chain with expertise in occupational health and safety. These roles support and institutionalize the application of the management system to protect workers. Management system elements are owned by experts with deep knowledge of aspects of occupational health and safety and who stay current on emerging trends and industry best practices and help to build those back into the management system to further strengthen occupational health and safety controls for our workers. Each employee has a responsibility to ensure that our products and operations meet applicable government or Dow standards, whichever is more stringent, as well as for using required operating and maintenance procedures. Performance monitoring is in place for each of our targets and commitments as well as for performance against goals, execution of our work processes, adherence to our policies and standards as well as for environmental, safety, sustainability and health performance. Roles and responsibilities are defined at multiple levels, including our policies, standards and procedures. Workers who fulfill each role in the management system are trained in the requirements, work process, tools and procedures that are needed for the role, and periodically depending upon the identified re-training requirements for each role. Team meeting frequency varies from quarterly to biweekly depending on the site. Decision-making authority is given to the teams with Dow leaders having final approvals. All workers are represented by these teams and some sites also include representation for select external contracting companies.\n",
      "REPORTING & DISCLOSURE TRACKING OUR PROGRESS DOW | REPORTING & DISCLOSURE | 158 Dow Disclosures – GRI Content Index Specific Actions In 2021, we elevated the Heavy Equipment and Moving Vehicle Standard to a Life Critical Standard, which requires additional training to ensure consistent application. We also added new requirements for additional protection using a hierarchy of controls approach for heavy equipment or moving vehicles operating in reverse. To reduce the number of injuries related to hand-held portable tool usage, we developed a new Hand-Held Portable Tools standard. The standard was piloted extensively and translated to over 15 languages prior to the anticipated 2022 rollout. To address risks associated with fatigue, we drafted and piloted a new Fatigue Risk Management standard in 2021. Development will continue in 2022 as the standard is fine-tuned and implemented globally. 403-1 Occupational health and safety management system Dow’s management system includes policies, requirements, processes, best practices and procedures and is integrated with Environment, Health and Safety, Quality and Operations standards. Our system is grounded in requirements of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), and incorporates some non-U.S. region-specific regulatory requirements, as well as our own more stringent requirements. Our management system covers Dow workers regardless of whether they are working on or off Dow premises, and all contracted workers performing work on Dow premises. We also include contractors in our calculated OSHA injury rate performance to drive inclusiveness at our sites. Workers who deliver materials (e.g., package delivery services) are excluded from our full management system but receive an orientation if entering our sites. The management system is designed and implemented by professionals employed or contracted by Dow (e.g., Occupational Health, Industrial Hygiene and EH&S Delivery). 403-2 Hazard identification, risk assessment and incident investigation As a chemical company it is important to understand that chemicals are in closed systems; exposure can occur when they are opened. There is no contact between chemicals and workers during normal manufacturing processing. We institutionalize safe practices to open lines or reactors and when we shut down for large maintenance such as a turnaround. Hazard Identification Initial and routine hazard analysis programs are in place. A team of toxicologists, industrial hygienists and physicians apply their expertise and knowledge of the scientific and medical literature and work processes to monitor trends and regulations in worker health assessment. Worker health hazards are considered as part of the risk review process for new products and changes in the manufacture of current products. Qualitative exposure assessments are conducted for chemical, physical, ergonomic and biological hazards overseen by professional industrial hygienists. We use a hierarchy of controls to mitigate worker safety and health risks. Industrial hygiene guidelines drive use of engineering controls and appropriate personal protective equipment. There is regular evaluation and periodic re-evaluation of process safety hazards via our Process Hazard Analysis and Layers of Protection Analysis methodologies. Personal safety risk analysis is performed as a part of numerous work processes (e.g., permit to work, safe work permit, pre-task analysis and pre-startup safety reviews). Risk Assessment Occupational Health and local EH&S operations personnel identify workers at potential risk. Dow’s global ODMS includes requirements, work processes and tools to ensure that incident investigations are identified, conducted, and include requirements and recommendations for improvements. This includes a list of global trigger criteria that identify the events that require an investigation. Dow’s management system is externally assessed and meets both ISO-14001, ISO-9001 and Responsible Care ® code requirements.\n",
      "REPORTING & DISCLOSURE TRACKING OUR PROGRESS DOW | REPORTING & DISCLOSURE | 159 Dow Disclosures – GRI Content Index Quality is driven through the requirements, performance principles and work processes embedded in ODMS. Compliance with ODMS and regulations is tracked through self- assessments, audits, management system reviews and overdue mechanical integrity inspections. Behavior-based interactions and interventions, and environmental and safety incidents undergo investigation – and in cases where there is a potential of severe consequence, a formal root-cause investigation – to identify opportunities for improvement. The results of medical surveillance exams (performed to assess patterns of recognized occupational illnesses and breakdown in protective measures) are used to provide feedback and continuous improvement. Employee feedback is encouraged through site safety meetings and senior leadership visits. Workers receive training on the management system and its components applicable to their role. Knowledge and ability to perform their role within the management system is validated. We maintain an independent internal audit process and every company location is audited with frequency based on the relative risk of the activities at each location. Dow’s EH&S Auditing Group is aligned to Dow’s Corporate Auditor, who reports to the Audit Committee of the Board and administratively to Dow’s CFO. Periodic external audits are based on government requirements. Additionally, more than 75% of our large U.S. and Canadian manufacturing sites participate in voluntary programs, which include additional auditing, for example, OSHA’s Voluntary Protection Program and the Canadian Federation of Construction Safety Associations’ Certificate of Recognition program (COR™). Audit findings are shared for global learning and improvement. Gaps identified in these internal audits are addressed via corrective or preventive actions captured in our global corrective and preventive action (CAPA) repository, with gap closure required within 12 months of the audit. Incident Investigation We apply root cause investigation (RCI) methodology for all recordable injuries and many of our near-miss situations. A near-miss situation is where the potential existed for a life-impacting injury. Consistent use of the methodology ensures we understand the cause and take corrective actions at the point of the problem, as well as at the strategy and management system levels. We use a hierarchy of controls approach to develop robust protection layers designed to prevent repeat incidents. Workers have a direct line of sight to potential hazards. They are expected and encouraged to identify, report and intervene when unsafe or unhealthy work conditions are observed. They also positively recognize coworkers making safe choices. Worker input on hazards and solutions is part of local near-miss programs and leveraged where appropriate. 403-3 Occupational health services Through baseline and periodic medical surveillance exams and testing, Dow’s Occupational Health team ensures identification of adverse health effects among employees based on role or potential exposure to occupational hazards. Exam content and frequency are defined in Dow’s ODMS. We use the same rigorous standards globally. Health results are documented in our health records system and carefully monitored for health trends. Travel health services (e.g., counseling, infectious disease, vaccinations and access to local care) reduce risk for endemic or acute health problems while on business. The impact of personal health on ability to work is assessed through fitness for duty consultations. Worker health is protected or enhanced through workplace tobacco and substance-use policies, a fatigue management system, ergonomic assessment referral, health engagement and well-being programming. Occupational Health staff hold recognized qualifications and accreditations. Occupational Health maintains a personnel list, capturing those items necessary for the role and audits this list twice a year. For external clinics this is part of an established quality review of the facility. Workers’ personal health information adheres to the Dow Code of Conduct Policy | Public Policy | Dow Corporate for data protection. Occupational Health does not share personal health information outside its subfunction without the informed consent of the individual and on a need-to-know basis with respect to work-related injury/illness cases for classification purposes. We use only aggregated data (personal identifiers removed) in reporting health data. Confidentiality training is assigned prior to access to medical records. Every Dow employee has access to occupational health services at no cost through an on-site company-managed clinic at our major sites, or an off-site provider managed by Dow Occupational Health. Clinical treatment is available to all employees for work-related injury or illness, and employees can access occupational health care on paid work time.\n",
      "REPORTING & DISCLOSURE TRACKING OUR PROGRESS DOW | REPORTING & DISCLOSURE | 160 Dow Disclosures – GRI Content Index 403-4 Worker participation, consultation, and communication on occupational health and safety At all levels of the organization, safety and health are part of our conversations with employees. From our CEO to business and functional leaders to site leaders, our safety performance and top issues are reviewed and discussed to keep safety front and center. In addition, at all Dow locations globally, workers are invited to participate in Health and Safety teams at the facility and site level. At the local level, employees participate in root cause investigations (RCIs), “fresh eyes” assessments, internal audits and numerous other continuous improvement activities. Moreover, all workers are expected to comply with regulatory requirements and attend safety meetings where select trainings and communications are provided and discussed for the workforce at large. Our workforce is represented either by monthly joint-management worker safety committees or participate in monthly safety meetings, where we review and act upon worker safety data and concerns, and develop implementation plans for new or improved government or company health and safety requirements. Decision making authority varies by site, but includes EH&S professionals and leadership with input from affected workers. 403-5 Worker training on occupational health and safety Training needs are assessed based on job role, job location, and knowledge and skill performance assessments. Subject matter experts work with learning specialists to design training content and determine the delivery method appropriate for the training needs risk level. Training topics align with our EH&S ODMS and cover Transportation Safety and Security; Emergency Preparedness and Response; Employee Health and Safety; Pollution Prevention; Process Safety; Product Stewardship; and Security. Where needed, based on role or local requirements, training content is translated. All employees and contractors receive occupational health and safety training. The frequency of the training is dependent on risk, performance as determined by needs assessments and regulatory requirements. Training is offered free of charge during working hours. In the case of Operations, some roles receive overtime pay to attend training sessions. Training effectiveness is assessed dependent on role and risk. Knowledge checks are assessed in web-based training, at the end of instructor-led training, via in-field performance assessments or by training review boards. 403-6 Promotion of worker health Emergency care is provided to all (employees, contractors, visitors). Access to non-occupational care for Dow employees is through on-site Dow clinics, through Dow Family Health Centers (U.S.) or to external community health care facilities. Employee costs may be offset through Dow-provided or subsidized medical insurance coverage. In general, Dow does not offer medical care to non-Dow employees, such as contractors, unless required by regulations. The company has embraced Total Worker Health™ as part of its World Leading Operations sustainability targets. It integrates occupational safety and health protection with health promotion through the elements of Healthy Culture, Healthy People and Healthy Workplace. By 2025, Dow strives to reach 100% Total Worker Health™, which includes three key indices. The Healthy Culture index, which includes achievement of healthy meal choices for on-site cafeterias and the promotion of staffed and unstaffed fitness centers, is an example of one such index. As part of the Healthy People assessment, we make our employees aware of their health risks and target health promotion programs based on the site population’s most significant risks. Recognizing that mental health issues are on the rise, we continue to encourage our employees and leaders to utilize and promote the Dow employee assistance programs, which have long been available for all our employees globally. No voluntary programs or services are associated with decisions regarding employment or engagement of workers.\n",
      "REPORTING & DISCLOSURE TRACKING OUR PROGRESS DOW | REPORTING & DISCLOSURE | 161 Dow Disclosures – GRI Content Index 403-7 Prevention and mitigation of occupational health and safety impacts directly linked by business relationships Dow has a multipronged approach toward preventing and mitigating occupational health and safety impacts linked by business relationships, which includes: • Dow’s transportation safety and security requirements are communicated to help businesses and functions minimize the risk of harm posed by chemicals in the supply chain to the public, contractor and supply chain workers, and the environment. The program includes a supply chain security program that meets or exceeds applicable governmental and transportation regulation requirements, in addition to Responsible Care® Security Code of Management Practice. The program also includes distribution and business risk reviews and management; safe handling guidelines for products in transport; packaging and container requirements qualification; monitoring and periodic assessment of logistics service providers per Responsible Care® principles or approved equivalent; safe handling of chemicals at loading and unloading facilities; and transportation incident reporting and investigation. • The External Manufacturing work process and standard set minimum performance expectations for external manufacturers to demonstrate adherence to sound health, safety, security, and environmental principles and operating philosophy such as Responsible Care®. External manufacturers agree to submit to an initial on-site Environmental, Health, Safety and Quality (EH&S-Q) Assessment and subsequent EH&S-Q Audits at a frequency determined by Dow based on risk. • Businesses establish a Product Stewardship Program to ensure that health, safety and environmental protection is an integral part of designing, manufacturing, marketing, distributing, using, recycling and disposing of Dow products. • Dow organizations meet applicable internal and external Good Manufacturing and Distribution Practice requirements for active pharmaceutical and cosmetic ingredients, as well as food contact and food additives and pharmaceutical excipients. • When Dow employees operate the assets of a third party, such as part of our Dow Services Business, we ensure that, at a minimum, the Dow EH&S standards will be met to ensure the same level of protection of the workforce and the environment. • The Global Remediation group manages Dow’s global portfolio of remediation liabilities. Mitigation of risk to human health and the environment is the primary objective in remedial plans. Selected solutions for remediation opportunities are based on risk assessment results; highest and best land use and sustainability; full compliance with legal requirements; and ensuring alignment with Dow’s core values around protecting our people and our planet. Additionally, Dow selects and manages its suppliers based on a robust set of criteria ranging from performance and economics to ESG factors. See GRI 308-103 Supplier Management Approach for more information. 403-8 Workers covered by an occupational health and safety management system 100% of workers whose work and/or workplace is controlled by Dow are required to comply with health and safety management system requirements.

Stakeholder mapping identifies the following as key audiences in community awareness programs: Employees, residents and community representatives, local and state authorities, law enforcement agencies, local emergency planning organizations, CACs, educational institutions, media, customers, suppliers and industrial-park tenants. Dow sites have a documented Community Outreach Program, which details site operations, products, applications and distribution, corporate social responsibility and projects to protect the community’s safety, health and the environment. Dow maintains a dialogue with stakeholders about emergency response plans, reduction of waste and emissions, and we create opportunities to educate and improve community confidence and address community needs. Feedback received from community sources (CAC meetings, local government organizations, industry partnerships, directly from community members, etc.) is addressed to maintain the highest standards of safety, security and emergency preparedness in every Dow community. Community members have access to Dow and Dow-related information 24/7, whether it is through social media, WhatsApp, local community hotlines, Dow websites and/or email. Dow is committed to acting on community input and communicating transparently to ensure our communities where we live and work remain strong and vibrant. Social impact is defined as ways in which people’s lives are improved or contributions to society. For Dow charitable contributions totaling $100,000 and above, we assess social impact by applying our measurement approach to determine return on investment and understand community outcomes. True Impact, Dow’s third-party vendor, completes the evaluation process by working directly with nonprofit organizations to collect and interpret data. 413-2 Operations with significant actual and potential negative impacts on local communities Reference Note 16 – Commitments and Contingent Liabilities, Environmental Matters and Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, Environmental Matters section of the Dow Inc.

We believe that engaging suppliers on climate change is an entry point to a broader discussion on sustainability and social responsibility. By requesting climate data, as Dow did via CDP in 2021, we connected to our supplier’s sustainability representatives in a new way and advanced novel conversations on ESG. We are leveraging and expanding this engagement in 2022 to cover a broader suite of ESG topics, including supplier diversity and social topics. We also upgraded our Supplier Code of Conduct to reflect the aspects of social risk and responsibilities and the expectations that we have of our suppliers.\n",
      "REPORTING & DISCLOSURE TRACKING OUR PROGRESS DOW | REPORTING & DISCLOSURE | 172 Dow Disclosures – GRI Content Index Engaging suppliers that prioritize social issues is important. We select and manage suppliers based on a robust set of criteria ranging from performance and economics to ESG factors. In the reporting year, all new suppliers were engaged on ESG factors through data collection, policies, and guidelines like the Supplier Code of Conduct (Supplier Code of Conduct| Public Policy | Corporate). The Supplier Code of Conduct stipulates requirements related to social responsibility including Respect Freedom of Association and Collective Bargaining, No Forced and Compulsory Labor, No Harassment and Abuse of Labor, No Child Labor, No Discrimination, Supplier Diversity, Appropriate Work Hours and Wages, and No Conflict Minerals Sourcing. In addition, some Dow procurement selection processes include additional social criteria related to a certain sector or commercial area. Beginning in 2022, ESG criteria will be used for all sourcing decisions. Management Approach Components Description Commitments Gender Pay Gap • Dow is committed to making continued progress in several key areas to advance gender equity and further develop our female talent pipeline • Dow is committed to correcting underlying disparities through pay audits and annual compensation reviews that factor in how we set pay (education, experience, responsibilities and performance). • We are also committed to looking beyond wages to examine bonuses, stock awards, promotion rates and concentration levels by gender in certain jobs. • Dow also looks to eliminate bias in hiring through unconscious-bias training (i.e., inclusive hiring standard, inclusive job descriptions, unconscious bias training and inclusive leadership training). Minimum Wage • Dow is committed to worker prosperity. We are investing in workforce, education and skills training to create economic opportunity for all workers.

We adhere to the Responsible Care ® Product Safety Code and have based our own internal program on this code. Risk Characterization Tool The human and environmental risks of all our products are characterized using Dow’s risk characterization process/tool. The tool requires the assessment of hazard and exposure information to identify the appropriate risk tier. The risk tier then determines the required actions and reviews for the Product Stewardship program, including EH&S information development and publication, Business Risk Review requirements and distributor/customer support. Business Risk Review Process Our businesses utilize the Business Risk Review process to assess and minimize possible adverse impacts on people, property and the environment from our business activity, including minimizing EH&S impacts associated with new and existing products, applications and services throughout the product’s life cycle. Businesses are required to conduct risk reviews when new information is received, including for launch of new products; changes in product uses, chemical regulations or raw materials; when new health and safety data are generated; or when triggered, in certain cases, by the passage of time. Risk mitigation measures are identified and implemented as a direct result of the Business Risk Review work process. Various product stewardship efforts such as distributor and customer qualifications and industry safe handling guide development are examples of involvement in the storage, distribution, supply and use steps of product life. Dow focuses product environmental, health and safety (EH&S) management on the full product life cycle, from product innovation and raw material selection to production, customer and consumer use, and end of life or reuse. Dow continuously looks for improvement opportunities as part of our management approach at each stage of the product life cycle. Assessments are conducted on the life cycle of Dow’s products in accordance with ISO 14040/14044 standards. The company provides results of these assessments upon request when data is available. Management Approach Components Description Commitments Through our product safety program, we: • Ensure that adequate EH&S information is available to assess the safety of each product for its intended uses. • Characterize the risk of products and establish product safety programs and risk management requirements based on risk level. • Engage product safety subject matter experts in all product and process innovation and assessments of external manufacturing. • Ensure that appropriate product safety and stewardship expectations are established for suppliers and distributors. • Ensure that customers are provided appropriate product information. Targets As aligned to our 2025 Safe Materials for a Sustainable Planet 2025 Sustainability Goal, here are some specific milestones: • Develop and implement Product Stewardship Academies in emerging regions. By 2025, academies will be launched in 10 countries covering three regions (e.g., Africa, Asia Pacific and Latin America). • Develop five collaborations to advance the conversation on product safety. • Define and maintain Dow’s Product Safety Story. Responsibilities Dow’s Product Safety & Compliance team, including our business-aligned Product Stewardship group, our Toxicology and Environmental Research Lab, our Product Regulatory Services team and our Hazard Communication experts, manages this element for the company.\n",

Dow had zero health and safety related recalls of our commercially sold products in 2021. While disclosing specifics related to this metric is not possible due to confidentiality concerns, the metric, which fosters a culture of issue identification and resolution, has led to improvements in raw material and product composition data, distributor training and new distributor requirements, and better internal work process documentation and training for new and experienced employees. We will assess additional disclosure on a yearly basis. GRI 418: Customer Privacy 2016 NOTE: Political contributions is not a material topic for Dow, as determined by our ESG materiality assessment. We provide some perspective in this report for those stakeholders who have an interest in this topic. 418-103 Management approach See also: GRI 103 Management Approach (General) Management approach for customer privacy falls across several areas. Data Protection and Privacy Strict data privacy legislation is appearing in regions across the globe, such as General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in Europe and Personal Information Protection Law (PIPL) in China. In response to this trend, Dow established the Data Privacy Office within the Information Security Services organization to oversee data privacy and protection practices and compliance with global and regional regulations. Dow’s Data Protection & Privacy Policy governs the treatment of personal information for employees, customers, suppliers, contractors and any other person interacting with Dow. This policy mandates appropriate principles for the collection, processing and storage of personal data. It also identifies several key elements of the appropriate protection of personal data, including limitation of purpose, transparency, rights of access, security, confidentiality and restrictions on transfers to third parties. This policy reflects principles from the EU GDPR 2016/679 as well as the Canadian Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (PIPEDA). Data Ethics Dow is currently developing data ethics principles and related training and communication programs to promote the fair and responsible use of data within Dow. A governance structure is being defined to oversee the adoption of data ethics to drive the right balance between mitigating risk and delivering business value. In addition, Dow formed the Business Data Services (BDS) organization to establish long term ownership, roles and responsibilities, for preparing and maintaining data across our end-to-end processes. BDS will also share and promote data ethics, guidelines and practices throughout Dow’s business data network.\n",

The Company’s management is responsible for its assertion. Our responsibility is to express a conclusion on management’s assertion based on our review. Our review was conducted in accordance with attestation standards established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) in AT-C section 105, Concepts Common to All Attestation Engagements, and AT-C section 210, Review Engagements. Those standards require that we plan and perform the review to obtain limited assurance about whether any material modifications should be made to management’s assertion in order for it to be fairly stated. The procedures performed in a review vary in nature and timing from, and are substantially less in extent than an examination, the objective of which is to obtain reasonable assurance about whether management’s assertion is fairly stated, in all material respects, in order to express an opinion. Accordingly, we do not express such an opinion. Because of the limited nature of the engagement, the level of assurance obtained in a review is substantially lower than the assurance that would have been obtained had an examination been performed. We believe that the review evidence obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a reasonable basis for our conclusion. We are required to be independent and to meet our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with the Code of Professional Conduct issued by the AICPA. We applied the Statements on Quality Control Standards established by the AICPA and, accordingly, maintain a comprehensive system of quality control. The procedures we performed were based on our professional judgment. In performing our review, we conducted inquiries and performed analytical procedures. For a selection of ESG disclosures, we performed tests of mathematical accuracy of computations, compared the disclosures to underlying records, or observed the data collection process in regard to the accuracy of the data in the ESG disclosures. The preparation of the ESG disclosures in the GRI Content Index included within the 2021 ESG Report requires management to interpret the criteria, make determinations as to the relevancy of information to be included, and make estimates and assumptions that affect reported information. Measurement of certain amounts and ESG disclosures includes estimates and assumptions that are subject to substantial inherent measurement uncertainty resulting, for example, from the accuracy and precision of greenhouse gas emission conversion factors and the process to measure energy consumption. Obtaining sufficient, appropriate review evidence to support our conclusion does not reduce the inherent uncertainty in the amounts and ESG disclosures. The selection by management of different but acceptable measurement methods, input data, or assumptions may have resulted in materially different amounts or ESG disclosures being reported. Information outside of the ESG disclosures referenced or included in the GRI Content Index, including linked information, was not subject to our review, including the Alignment to UN Sustainable Development Goals, TCFD Disclosure Report, SASB Disclosures Report, WEF Disclosure Report, and Non-GAAP Financial Measures and, accordingly, we do not express a conclusion or any form of assurance on such information. Further, any information relating to periods prior to the year-ended December 31, 2020 or information relating to forward looking statements, targets, goals and progress against goals, was not subject to our review and, accordingly, we do not express a conclusion or any form of assurance on such information. As disclosed in the GRI Content Index related to GRI 302-1, the Company changed the methodology used to calculate energy consumption as of December 31, 2021. The methodology for this calculation was not revised in the prior periods presented. Our conclusion is not modified with respect to this matter. Based on our review, we are not aware of any material modifications that should be made to management of Dow’s assertion that the ESG disclosures referenced or included in the GRI Content Index included within the accompanying Dow 2021 ESG Report as of, and for the year ended December 31, 2021 are presented in accordance with the GRI Standards – Comprehensive option, in order for it to be fairly stated.

Management of Dow asserts that the ESG disclosures referenced or included in the GHG Protocol Disclosure Report for the year ended December 31, 2021, are presented in accordance with GHG Protocol: A Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard (Revised Edition), published by the World Resources Institute/World Business Council for Sustainable Development. Any information relating to Scope 3 was not subject to Deloitte & Touche LLP’s review; and accordingly they do not express a conclusion or any form of assurance on such information. Dow Disclosures – GHG Protocol Disclosure Report Reporting Policy and Scope for Greenhouse Gas Emissions Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions are collected and accounted for in accordance with the World Resources Institute/World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD) Greenhouse Gas Protocol: A Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard (Revised Edition). The GHG emissions covered by this inventory are based on the calendar year January 1 to December 31, 2021. Dow reports GHG emissions under the operational control approach criteria described in this standard. The company reports GHG emissions at approximately 100 sites globally with approximately 25 of those sites accounting for over 95% of our total GHG emissions. In cases where asset ownership is shared, a company has operational control over an asset if they have the full authority to introduce and implement its operating policies at the facility. For operations where Dow is a 50-50 partner or less and does not have full authority to implement our policies, emissions are excluded from this inventory. Scope 3 emissions data are prepared according to the Greenhouse Gas Protocol Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard and the Corporate Value Chain (Scope 3) Accounting and Reporting Standard, as well as the WBCSD’s Guidance for Accounting and Reporting Corporate GHG Emissions in the Chemical Sector Value Chain. Scope 3 GHG emissions data is reported for 13 of the 15 categories. Dow continues to work to develop data collection methodologies aligned with Scope 3 reporting for categories not currently being reported. Current Global Emissions in CO2e The following accounting includes four of the seven GHG emissions covered by the UNFCCC/Kyoto protocol: carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O), and hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs). Dow does not have emissions of perfluorocarbons (PFCs), sulfurhexafluoride (SF6), or nitrogen trifluoride (NF3). GHG emissions are reported in metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalents (CO2e).

Previous reporting utilized the energy content method. 2020 value has been updated in this report to reflect the work potential method. 2 Other GHG Emissions includes bromomethane, carbon monoxide, carbon tetrachloride, dimethyl ether and methylene bromide. Calculation Methodologies When calculating Scope 1 GHG emissions, source data is collected within multiple systems following internal processes. Calculation methodologies vary based on a hierarchical approach. Permit-specific or regulatory-required emissions factors are prioritized and, where these do not exist, other published emissions factors and calculation methodologies are used. Some sources for these factors include Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Control (IPCC) Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories; U.S. Resources (U.S. EPA State Inventory and Projection Tools; U.S. Emissions Factor Resources, or AP-42); and German Environmental Authority (12/2016). For the purposes of tracking against our targets to reduce GHG emissions, Dow utilizes the market-based methodology for Scope 2 accounting. Emissions are calculated by multiplying the amount of company-purchased steam and electricity consumed by supplier-specific emissions factors or factors denoted through energy attribute certificates, when available. When these factors are not available, Dow utilizes location-based emission factors rather than utilizing the residual mix emission factors. The impacted portion of electricity purchases is insignificant to overall Scope 2 emissions. Dow also reports Scope 2 emissions using the location-based method in which quantities of company- purchased steam and electricity are multiplied by the appropriate emissions factors for that geographic area, rather than supplier-specific factors. EPA EGrid factors are used for U.S.-based locations and International Energy Agency (IEA) factors are used for non-U.S. locations. GHG emissions calculations for Scope 3 follow the Greenhouse Gas Protocol and use recognized methodologies that leverage Dow’s primary data from purchasing, logistics, and sales records to build robust inventories. Most emissions are estimated using best available GHG emissions factors from sources like Ecoinvent v3.8, economic input-output models, and the Global Logistics Emissions Council (GLEC) Framework, although primary data from the value chain was used wherever possible. Base Year Dow measures our progress toward our current reduction target by our baseline year, 2020. If changes occur in the configuration of Dow assets or if significant emission changes are found that make a material impact to our global footprint, the baseline year will be recalculated to include the new configuration. These changes include, but are not limited to, transfer of ownership, improvement of calculation methodologies or the accuracy of emissions factors, and discovery of significant errors, singly or collectively. Baseline emissions for 2020 Scope 1 GHG emissions were updated in 2021 in accordance with our business rules to include previously not reported emissions from landfills and wastewater treatment facilities and improvements in calculation methodologies. Baseline emissions for 2020 Scope 2 GHG emissions are calculated using the market-based method. Targets For GHG emissions targets, see GRI 302-103 Energy Management Approach 2016 and 305-103 Emissions Management Approach 2016. For additional information on method’s used, see 305-2 Energy indirect (Scope 2) GHG emissions. Global Warming Potential (GWP) To compare the global warming impacts of different greenhouse gases, a universal unit of measurement is needed. Global warming potential (GWP) factors were developed to measure the amount of energy the emissions of one ton of gas will absorb relative to one ton of carbon dioxide. For Scope 1 emissions, in accordance with the Greenhouse Gas Protocol Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard, Dow uses the most recent IPCC assessment report (AR6) 100-year GWP values for all data, including the baseline, to maintain consistency across time. For Scope 2 emissions, Dow requests, but does not verify, the factors used when data is received from our suppliers. We will continue to improve our understanding of the factors used by our suppliers to represent the information as accurately as possible in the future.\n",

The Company’s management is responsible for its assertion. Our responsibility is to express a conclusion on management’s assertion based on our review. Our review was conducted in accordance with attestation standards established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) in AT-C section 105, Concepts Common to All Attestation Engagements, and AT-C section 210, Review Engagements. Those standards require that we plan and perform the review to obtain limited assurance about whether any material modifications should be made to management’s assertion in order for it to be fairly stated. The procedures performed in a review vary in nature and timing from, and are substantially less in extent than an examination, the objective of which is to obtain reasonable assurance about whether management’s assertion is fairly stated, in all material respects, in order to express an opinion. Accordingly, we do not express such an opinion. Because of the limited nature of the engagement, the level of assurance obtained in a review is substantially lower than the assurance that would have been obtained had an examination been performed. We believe that the review evidence obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a reasonable basis for our conclusion. We are required to be independent and to meet our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with the Code of Professional Conduct issued by the AICPA. We applied the Statements on Quality Control Standards established by the AICPA and, accordingly, maintain a comprehensive system of quality control. The procedures we performed were based on our professional judgment. In performing our review, we conducted inquiries and performed analytical procedures. For a selection of amounts, we performed tests of mathematical accuracy of computations, compared the amounts to underlying records, or observed the data collection process in regard to the accuracy of the data in the GHG disclosures. The preparation of the GHG disclosures in the GHG Protocol Disclosure Report included within the 2021 ESG Report requires management to interpret the criteria, make determinations as to the relevancy of information to be included, and make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported information. Measurement of Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG emissions includes estimates and assumptions that are subject to substantial inherent measurement uncertainty resulting, for example, from the accuracy and precision of greenhouse gas emission conversion factors. Obtaining sufficient, appropriate review evidence to support our conclusion does not reduce the inherent uncertainty in the amounts and GHG disclosures. The selection by management of different but acceptable measurement methods, input data or assumptions may have resulted in materially different amounts or GHG disclosures being reported. Information outside of the GHG Protocol Disclosure Report, including linked information, was not subject to our review, including the Alignment to U.N. Sustainable Development Goals, TCFD Disclosure Report, SASB Disclosures Report, WEF Disclosure Report, and Non-GAAP Financial Measures and, accordingly, we do not express a conclusion or any form of assurance on such information. Any information relating to Scope 3 was not subject to our review; and accordingly, we do not express a conclusion or any form of assurance on such information. Further, any information relating to Scope 3 and periods prior to the year ended December 31, 2021 or information relating to forward looking statements, targets, goals and progress against goals, was not subject to our review and, accordingly, we do not express a conclusion or any form of assurance on such information. Based on our review, we are not aware of any material modifications that should be made to management of Dow’s assertion that the GHG Protocol Disclosure Report included within the accompanying 2021 ESG Report for the year ended December 31, 2021 is presented in accordance with the GHG Protocol, in order for it to be fairly stated.

The Board and management review the company’s short- and long-term strategic priorities throughout the year and dedicate time at each Board meeting for appropriate discussion. Risk management is considered a strategic priority for the company, and responsibility for managing risk rests with executive management, while the Committees, and the Board as a whole, provide oversight. The ERM approach and process are overseen by the Audit Committee and reviewed at least annually with key risks regularly evaluated at meetings of the Committees and Board, including risks with economic, environmental and social impacts. Describe management’s role in assessing and managing climate-related risks and opportunities. Climate Management Structure See GRI 102-20 Executive-level responsibilities for economic, environmental and social topics. To manage the implementation of Dow’s Climate Strategy, Dow has established a Climate Program Management Office (Climate PMO). The team is led by the Climate Steering Team (CST), which sets strategy and oversees the activities related to assessing and managing climate-related risks and opportunities. The CST consists of executive business and functional leaders who report to either the CEO or CFO. The CST is facilitated by the global climate transition director, who also facilitates the Climate PMO. The Climate PMO is composed of business and functional leaders from across the company. The Climate PMO has a series of sub-teams responsible for assessing and managing climate related risks and opportunities, including reducing Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions; improving metric tracking and reporting; developing products, technologies and business models to address customers’ climate-related needs; and developing and executing actions to deliver committed targets. Each sub-team is sponsored by two or more members of the CST, who are accountable for the team’s success. The Climate PMO is tasked with setting goals and targets, prioritizing actions, monitoring progress of sub-teams and ensuring alignment of cross-team objectives. Both the CST and Climate PMO meet at least every six weeks and report to the ELT at a minimum of once per quarter. Climate PMO sub-teams meet more frequently as required to drive actions and progress toward project targets. Category Strategy: Disclose the actual and potential impacts of climate-related risks and opportunities on the organization’s businesses, strategy and financial planning Describe the climate-related risks and opportunities the organization has identified over the short, medium and long term. See also: GRI 201-2 Financial implications and other risks and opportunities due to climate change Addressing climate-related risks now, and in the future Addressing climate-related risks and opportunities is part of Dow’s overall climate strategy. In 2020, the company announced commitments to reduce its net annual greenhouse gas emissions by an additional 5 million metric tons by 2030 versus our 2020 baseline, a 15% reduction (the 2020 baseline represents a 15% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions since 2005). Dow also announced its intention to be carbon neutral by 2050 (Scopes 1+2+3, as defined by the Greenhouse Gas Protocol Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard, plus product benefits). Despite these commitments, climate change-related risks and uncertainties, legal or regulatory responses to climate change, and failure to meet our climate change commitments could negatively impact Dow’s operations, financial condition and/or reputation. Climate-related risks include both physical and transition risks.\n",
      "REPORTING & DISCLOSURE TRACKING OUR PROGRESS DOW | REPORTING & DISCLOSURE | 186 Dow Disclosures – TCFD Disclosure Report Climate-related physical risks include more frequent severe weather events, potential changes in precipitation patterns, water scarcity and extreme variability in weather patterns, which can disrupt the operations of the company as well as those of its customers, partners and vendors. In 2021, Dow partnered with S&P Global Trucost (Trucost) to assess the company’s exposure to climate-related physical risks based on the geographic location of our manufacturing operations. The risks assessed included water stress, heat waves, cold waves, droughts, hurricanes, wildfires and flooding. The analysis included an assessment of the physical risks using a baseline year of 2020 with time periods ranging to 2050, and scenarios of low, moderate and high climate change. Based on the Trucost methodology, which scores the exposure of sites to physical risks relative to global conditions, Dow is assessed as at moderate exposure in 2050 under all scenarios, with a weighted average that is slightly lower than the average of the materials industry (as defined by Trucost). Dow will use this information to inform decision-making at our sites with respect to managing climate-related physical risks. Climate-related transition risks include the availability, development and affordability of lower greenhouse gas emissions technology, the effects of carbon pricing and changes in public sentiment, regulations, taxes, public mandates or requirements. There are also significant climate opportunities for Dow, including the ability to be a leader in the development of lower emissions technology consistent with the recent announcement of a net-zero emissions facility in Alberta, Canada. Additional opportunity actions to achieve carbon neutrality include expanding access to renewable power and initiating a joint development project with Shell to develop electrified cracking technology powered by clean energy. Our technology and materials science leadership also provide a significant opportunity to deploy materials to help reduce emissions for customers and industries that will allow us to capture value from increasing demand for low-carbon and sustainable products. These are just some examples of critical steps on our path to carbon neutrality by 2050 while enabling business growth. The table below provides a summary of our climate-related risks and opportunities and the associated value chain stage, time horizon and magnitude of impact: Risk/Opportunity Type Description Value Chain Stage(s) Covered Time Horizon (term) Magnitude of Impact Risks Physical Acute & Chronic More frequent incidents of severe weather, or long-term changes in precipitation patterns • Direct operations • Upstream SHORT MEDIUM LONG LOW MEDIUM HIGH Transition Regulatory Carbon pricing mechanisms • Direct operations SHORT MEDIUM LONG LOW MEDIUM HIGH Technology Transition to lower-emissions technology • Direct operations • Upstream • Downstream SHORT MEDIUM LONG LOW MEDIUM HIGH Opportunities Resource Efficiency Use of more efficient production and distribution processes • Direct operations • Upstream SHORT MEDIUM LONG LOW MEDIUM HIGH Products & Services Dow products can enable the transition to a low-carbon economy • Upstream • Downstream SHORT MEDIUM LONG LOW MEDIUM HIGH\n",
      "REPORTING & DISCLOSURE TRACKING OUR PROGRESS DOW | REPORTING & DISCLOSURE | 187 Dow Disclosures – TCFD Disclosure Report Describe the impact of climate-related risks and opportunities on the organization’s businesses, strategy and financial planning. The potential impacts of climate-related risks and opportunities are part of Dow’s climate strategy and factored into Dow’s business and financial planning. When assessing the magnitude of impact, Dow evaluates elements such as changes to the cost of raw materials, impact on operating cost (e.g., energy costs, costs of complying with regulation), cost of investment in new technology to reduce emissions, impact to the price at which products can be sold, impact of potential lost sales, or in the case of opportunities, improvements in production, increased revenues, cost efficiencies and market share gained. In addition, there could be impacts that need to be considered that are not able to be quantified financially (e.g., reputational impact of certain risks and opportunities). Dow is taking specific actions to mitigate identified climate-related physical and transition risks, while also advancing opportunities in several key areas. These include: • Optimizing Facilities and Processes: Water recycling investments to reduce Dow’s water use and the potential impact of water stress. One example is our commitment to 100% water circularity by 2025 at our site in Terneuzen, the Netherlands. • Increasing Renewable Energy: Dow continues to invest in cost-efficient clean energy, including wind, solar and hydropower, across our operations. In 2021, we expanded access to renewable power to more than 900 MW, so that more than 25% of our purchased electricity comes from renewable sources. Dow is a leading user of renewable energy in the chemical industry and in the top 20 among global corporations according to BloombergNEF. • Investing in and Innovating for Carbon Reduction: In support of Dow’s long-term GHG reduction targets, Dow announced $1B in annual capital spending allocation for the foreseeable future to decarbonize assets, in a phased approach, while growing capacity. This investment plan includes large, industry-leading projects, such as the recently announced net-zero carbon emissions site in Alberta, Canada, as well as emissions-reduction investments in existing facilities and replacement of end-of-life carbon intensive assets with state-of-the-art, carbon-efficient and sustainable technologies. In 2021, Dow implemented energy efficiency and emissions reduction projects, reducing energy consumption by 1.232 million KJ/year and amounting to 611,500 metric tons of CO2 reduction (GRI 302-4 and 305-5). In 2021, Dow’s Terneuzen site outlined a roadmap to support the Dutch Climate Agreement and enable a reduction of 1.7 million metric tons of CO2 annually by 2030 vs. a 2020 baseline. • Engaging our Suppliers to Reduce Value Chain Emissions: Dow joined the CDP Supply Chain Program to collect supplier data and identify value-chain emissions improvement opportunities. • Innovating Materials to Enable Customers to Reduce Emissions: Dow is aligning its innovation and product portfolios to address sustainability opportunities, including climate. Examples include the launch of our industry-leading solution for carbon capture into the Asia Pacific market, encompassing innovative formulated UCARSOL™ and SELEXOL™ solvents, as well as professional solvent management and maintenance services. The company also introduced three new DOWSIL™ silicone technologies for electric and hybrid vehicle applications.\n",

      "REPORTING & DISCLOSURE TRACKING OUR PROGRESS DOW | REPORTING & DISCLOSURE | 189 Dow Disclosures – TCFD Disclosure Report Dow takes an exploratory approach to climate-related scenario analyses to evaluate a range of different futures. Most recently, Dow has utilized two boundary scenarios to assess our strategy: one where our global ambition aligns with the International Energy Agency (IEA) Sustainable Development scenario of decarbonizing the economy, and another that aligns with the Regional Rivalry Shared Socioeconomic Pathway (SSP) 3.0, which explores a more uneven path to decarbonization. As Dow is a large consumer of energy, scenarios that focus on trends in energy consumption are particularly relevant to Dow. The scenarios selected were intended to span a range of potential energy futures in terms of global primary energy consumption and energy types. Dow also selected these scenarios to cover a range of assumptions around policy development. The scenarios highlight varying outcomes. For example, in the Sustainable Development scenario, Dow’s cost of regulatory compliance is higher than in Regional Rivalry, but our opportunities for the development of low-emissions goods and services and low-carbon technologies are much greater. We utilize these results to build the resiliency of our company as it relates to a variety of outcomes. The following table shows summary parameters of externally developed scenarios selected to evaluate climate risk/opportunity: Scenario Descriptions, 2050 Snapshot Sustainable Development 1 Regional Rivalry 2 Description Coordinated path to decarbonization Uneven path to decarbonization Market Trends Increased demand for solutions that mitigate climate change Slower, regionally driven demand for solutions that mitigate climate change, greater market for climate adaptation products Temperature Rise <1.5°C 2.1°C Carbon Price (USD/metric ton) 135 30 Renewable Energy (% of total primary energy) 47 17 1 IEA Sustainable Development Scenario 2 Regional Rivalry, Shared Socioeconomic Pathway 3.0, RCP6.0 Dow’s strategy is resilient to a range of potential outcomes. For example, in 2021, we outlined a clear path to decarbonize our production processes (Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions) utilizing a phased approach in which end-of-life capacity is replaced with higher-efficiency, lower GHG-emitting assets. This phased approach will enable us to achieve decarbonization in our Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions in line with a well-below 2°C world, as is envisioned by the Sustainable Development scenario, while mitigating the affordability risk that presents itself should there be a slower global adoption of the regulatory frameworks needed to address climate change, as is the potential under the Regional Rivalry scenario. For Dow’s downstream businesses, both scenarios present opportunities to develop solutions related to climate change – whether these are focused on the mitigation of climate change or the products that address climate adaptation. Climate scenarios also are incorporated into our long-term assessments of Dow’s manufacturing sites, which is a key input into Dow’s capital approval process. Category Risk Management: Disclose the processes used by the organization to identify, assess and manage climate-related risks Describe the organization’s processes for identifying and assessing climate-related risks. Dow’s ERM process is responsible for identifying significant or major risks to the company and creating action plans to mitigate risks, including climate risks. On an annual basis, the ERM process screens risks from a broad range of inputs, both internal and external to Dow. All risks are reviewed and categorized based on potential impact and likelihood of a significant event occurring. Each risk is assigned to a member of Dow’s Executive Leadership Team and, if needed, to an internal subject matter expert accountable for mitigation plans.\n",

Key risks that have specified mitigation actions are reviewed more regularly in leadership team meetings. In addition, risks can be re-evaluated based on several factors including changes in the external and macroeconomic environment, concerns identified by senior leaders or Dow’s Board, or through detection in Dow’s internal work processes. The Audit Committee has oversight of the ERM process and reviews it annually. Specific risks are also reviewed with the Environment, Health, Safety & Technology Committee, Corporate Governance Committee and/or the full Board.

      "REPORTING & DISCLOSURE TRACKING OUR PROGRESS DOW | REPORTING & DISCLOSURE | 191 Dow Disclosures – TCFD Disclosure Report Scope 1, 2 and 3 GHG Emissions Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions are collected and accounted for in accordance with the World Resources Institute/World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD) Greenhouse Gas Protocol: A Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard (Revised Edition). Scope 3 emissions data are prepared according to the GHG Protocol’s Corporate Accounting Standard and the Corporate Value Chain (Scope 3) Accounting and Reporting Standard, as well as the WBCSD’s Guidance for Accounting and Reporting Corporate GHG Emissions in the Chemical Sector Value Chain. For more information on GHG emissions see 305-1 Direct (Scope 1) GHG emissions, 305-2 Energy indirect (Scope 2) GHG emissions and the GHG Protocol Disclosure Report – Scope 1 Emissions by GHG. Overall, Scope 1 emissions decrease slightly in 2021 relative to 2020 which is in line with normal year over year operating fluctuations and supported by energy reduction projects such as flare gas reduction and other energy efficiency projects. The current actions in flight will enable reduction of net emissions in the medium to longer term. Dow’s Scope 2 emissions were reduced by approximately 400,000 metric tons CO2e (6.4% reduction) in 2021 when compared to 2020 as a result of Dow’s efforts to source cleaner sources of energy to support our sites. When compared to 2020, increases in 2021 Scope 3 emissions were driven by two primary factors. First, some variations were due to differences in Dow’s products or operations. Most significantly, Dow increased its sales of fuel additives, which resulted in an increase in category 3.11, Use of Sold Products, by approximately four million tons of CO2e. Second, as part of our work to continuously improve the accuracy and comprehensiveness of our scope 3 accounting, several improvements were implemented in this reporting cycle.2 We expect our Scope 3 emissions methodology and values to continue to evolve as we enhance and further standardize our approach and refine our estimates with more specific and primary data. We are working to establish transparent approaches and to define scope 3 targets that will allow us to demonstrate clear progress on our Scope 3 emissions reductions.

Energy Intensity See also: GRI 302-1 Energy Consumption and GRI 302-3 Energy Intensity Energy intensity is calculated using total energy consumption (GRI 302-1 Energy consumption within the organization) divided by production volume. We have evolved our production volume to total valued production which includes byproducts and coproducts and has been applied to all years reported. As noted in 302-1, the methodology was updated for total energy consumption and changes are being applied prospectively; prior year periods will not be revised. Therefore, energy intensity values are presented consistent with the approach in 302-1 where the 2021 energy intensity values have been calculated using the values from the new and historical methods for energy consumption. This approach enables comparisons to prior year data. Overall, energy intensity for 2021 was flat when compared to 2020.\n",

The changing patterns in supply and demand for water in a climate change impacted world have posed challenges for certain manufacturing assets, such as extended droughts in certain locations and low river levels, impacting ability to ship products. We have developed a methodology to evaluate water risk at Dow sites. We have also engaged in developing optimization tools to understand the relationship between water and our climate adaptation strategy. This metric was adopted in recognition of the criticality of virgin fresh water as a shared resource in water-stressed basins and to ensure that water does not become a constraint on community prosperity. Dow’s six KWSS, which all comply with ISO 14001-2015 standards, include: Freeport, Texas (Brazos River); Seadrift, Texas (Guadalupe River); Bahia Blanca, Argentina (Purchased freshwater); Terneuzen, The Netherlands (Rivers Rhine and Meuse); Böhlen, Germany (River Weisse Elster and Lake Witznitz) and Tarragona, Spain (Purchased freshwater supply source from Ebro River diversion). Dow has set a target to reduce freshwater intake intensity at KWSS by 20% from its 2015 baseline. 1 The freshwater intake intensity metric is calculated by taking the sum of virgin freshwater withdrawal associated with Dow manufacturing at the KWSS divided by production volume. Dow has set a target to reduce freshwater intake intensity at KWSS by 20% from its 2015 baseline. In 2021, Dow updated its freshwater intensity metric to only account for freshwater intake associated with Dow production (and not transferred to industrial park [iPark] tenants) and improved the calculation of large variations associated with water reservoirs. In addition, the production volume used in this metric uses total valued production which includes products produced by the company, as well as byproducts and coproducts generated from the production, which is in line with other intensity metrics at Dow. Baseline Year Baseline Value 2021 2020 2019  Target Year Target Value 2015 6.6 4.5 6.1 6.7 2025 5.3 1 As indicated below – the freshwater intake intensity calculation has changed from previously reported numbers. The freshwater intake intensity shows a reduction in 2021. A water conservation project was implemented at Freeport, Texas, which also benefited from the installation of certain higher efficiency assets. Increase in rainfall at major sites and weather freeze events resulting in unplanned shutdowns, impacting both water withdrawal and production, account for the remaining decrease which are beyond Dow’s control. Renewable Power and Energy Metrics (%) A key element of Dow’s climate action plan to reduce Scope 2 emissions is to increase access to renewable power to support our sites. Dow’s access to renewable power has expanded to over 900 MW, surpassing Dow’s 2025 Sustainability Goal of obtaining 750 MW of its power demand from renewable sources. Tracking renewable power as a percentage of power purchased is a metric that can indicate progress against this pillar of our plan. As Dow also operates combined heat and power (CHP) plants to support our sites, we are also providing the percentage of renewable power we purchase as a portion of the total power consumed. Lastly, we provide the metric on renewable energy (renewable power and steam we purchase) as a percent of energy consumed, which includes fuel purchases to run our operations and self-generate power and steam, consumption of process off-gas for energy-related activities, purchased electricity and purchased steam.\n",

Dow has two metrics to track progress that assess our innovation and product portfolios. These are evolving metrics and we will continue to advance our approach to ensure progress and transparency. • R&D Portfolio alignment to sustainability (%): Our innovation portfolio and its alignment to our climate and other sustainability priorities is critical for achieving our sustainability goals. We have developed and implemented an approach that documents the primary alignment of each innovation project to Dow’s sustainability priorities. The approach uses a rigorous and well-defined process that includes training, review and approval of the data, as well as an annual evaluation to drive improvement. 2021 was the second year for the evaluation approach and we will continue to evolve to ensure alignment of innovation with our sustainability priorities. Description 20211 20202 2019  % R&D portfolio alignment to sustainability >85% >80% 1 Innovation projects are aligned to Dow’s sustainability focus areas and provide a sustainability benefit over incumbent approaches (2021). 2 Innovation projects are aligned to Dow’s sustainability focus areas: climate protection, circular economy, stop the waste and safer materials (2020). • Sustainability-driven revenue opportunities: Dow’s materials science solutions enable several markets and applications where sustainability is the key growth driver. Often characterized by a double-digit compound annual growth rate, these applications are fueled by commitments of consumers, private sector and governments to support the transition to a lower-carbon and more circular economy. Some examples of new or growing markets that are driven by sustainability include, but are not limited to: green buildings and climate change adaptation, e-mobility, renewable energy generation, recycling and food preservation. Dow’s businesses identify products in their portfolios that help enable such applications and report respective revenues at a market segment level. The table below supplies the 2021 aggregated ratio: Description 2021 1 2020 2019  Revenue from products that enable sustainability-driven markets 43% Revenue from products that address world challenges 48% 48% 1 The definition of this metric has been updated for 2021 and is not able to be applied to prior years. In 2021 we collected revenue from products that enable sustainability-driven markets. In 2020 and 2019, we captured revenue from products that address world challenges. Dow’s products sold into sustainability-driven applications are crucial building blocks (see Innovating low-carbon materials and technologies); however, they often have similar characteristics to competing products or a business-as-usual level of performance. Work is underway to start reporting separately revenues of those products that are better for the planet and people across their life cycle compared with incumbent solutions. Examples include low-carbon materials, products with recycled and bio-content, solutions enabling recycling, biodegradable products and materials that are safer than incumbents.\n",

These SDGs align with the World Business Council for Sustainable Development’s chemical sector SDG roadmap. SDGs That Present Business Opportunities and Risks Some goals present a business opportunity or risk, and it is important that our commercial teams understand the sustainable development-driven changes coming to the markets they serve. In some cases, these changes may lead to product deselection. In others, new and growing markets present opportunities for innovative Dow products to enable sustainable development. SDGs That Are an Opportunity to Engage and Contribute These SDGs are areas where Dow can engage and make positive contributions but is not positioned or expected to take the lead. Dow can support through visible actions and partnerships. SDGs That Dow Currently Negatively Impacts A few SDGs represent areas where the current impact of Dow’s products or operations could be inconsistent with the achievement of the goal. Our three focus areas of Climate Protection, Circular Economy and Safer Materials are well-aligned to drive measurable reductions in our impacts and these areas are all aligned with opportunities for Dow to lead.

      "REPORTING & DISCLOSURE TRACKING OUR PROGRESS DOW | REPORTING & DISCLOSURE | 210 Non-GAAP Financial Measures This document includes financial information that does not conform to U.S. GAAP and is considered non-GAAP measures. Management uses these measures internally for planning, forecasting and evaluating the performance of the company’s segments, including allocating resources. Dow’s management believes that these non-GAAP measures best reflect the ongoing performance of the company during the periods presented and provide more relevant and meaningful information to investors as they provide insight with respect to ongoing operating results of the company and a more useful comparison of year-over-year results. These non-GAAP measures supplement the company’s U.S. GAAP disclosures and should not be viewed as alternatives to U.S. GAAP measures of performance. Furthermore, such non-GAAP measures may not be consistent with similar measures provided or used by other companies. Non-GAAP measures included in this release are defined below. Operating EBIT is defined as earnings (i.e., “Income (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes”) before interest, excluding the impact of significant items. Pro forma operating EBIT is defined as pro forma earnings (i.e., “Pro Forma income (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes”) before interest, excluding the impact of significant items. Operating EBITDA is defined as earnings (i.e., “Income (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes”) before interest, depreciation and amortization, excluding the impact of significant items. Pro forma operating EBITDA is defined as pro forma earnings (i.e., “Pro Forma income (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes”) before interest, depreciation and amortization, excluding the impact of significant items. Cash Flow Conversion is defined as “Cash flows from operating activities - continuing operations” divided by Operating EBITDA. Management believes Cash Flow Conversion is an important financial metric as it helps the company determine how efficiently it is converting its earnings into cash flow. Free Cash Flow is defined as “Cash flow from operating activities - continuing operations,” less capital expenditures. Under this definition, Free Cash Flow represents the cash generated by Dow from operations after investing in its asset base. Free Cash Flow, combined with cash balances and other sources of liquidity, represents the cash available to fund obligations and provide returns to stockholders. Free Cash Flow is an integral financial measure used in the company’s financial planning process. Net Debt is defined as total gross debt minus “Cash and cash equivalents” and “Marketable securities.” Operating ROC is defined as net operating profit after tax (excluding significant items) divided by total average capital, also referred to as ROIC.\n",
      "Cautionary Statement about Forward-Looking Statements Certain statements in this report are “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the federal securities laws, including Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Such statements often address expected future business and financial performance, financial condition, and other matters, and often contain words or phrases such as “anticipate,” “believe,” “estimate,” “expect,” “intend,” “may,” “opportunity,” “outlook,” “plan,” “project,” “seek,” “should,” “strategy,” “target,” “will,” “will be,” “will continue,” “will likely result,” “would” and similar expressions, and variations or negatives of these words or phrases. Forward-looking statements are based on current assumptions and expectations of future events that are subject to risks, uncertainties and other factors that are beyond Dow’s control, which may cause actual results to differ materially from those projected, anticipated or implied in the forward-looking statements and speak only as of the date the statements were made. These factors include, but are not limited to: sales of Dow’s products; Dow’s expenses, future revenues and profitability; the continuing global and regional economic impacts of the coronavirus disease 2019 (“COVID-19”) pandemic and other public health-related risks and events on Dow’s business; any sanction, export restrictions, supply chain disruptions or increased economic uncertainty related to the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine; capital requirements and need for and availability of financing; unexpected barriers in the development of technology, including with respect to Dow’s contemplated capital and operating projects; Dow’s ability to realize its commitment to carbon neutrality on the contemplated timeframe; size of the markets for Dow’s products and services and ability to compete in such markets; failure to develop and market new products and optimally manage product life cycles; the rate and degree of market acceptance of Dow’s products; significant litigation and environmental matters and related contingencies and unexpected expenses; the success of competing technologies that are or may become available; the ability to protect Dow’s intellectual property in the United States and abroad; developments related to contemplated restructuring activities and proposed divestitures or acquisitions such as workforce reduction, manufacturing facility and/or asset closure and related exit and disposal activities, and the benefits and costs associated with each of the foregoing; fluctuations in energy and raw material prices; management of process safety and product stewardship; changes in relationships with Dow’s significant customers and suppliers; changes in consumer preferences and demand; changes in laws and regulations, political conditions or industry development; global economic and capital markets conditions, such as inflation, market uncertainty, interest and currency exchange rates, and equity and commodity prices; business or supply disruptions; security threats, such as acts of sabotage, terrorism or war including the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine; weather events and natural disasters; disruptions in Dow’s information technology networks and systems; and risks related to Dow’s separation from DowDuPont Inc. such as Dow’s obligation to indemnify DuPont de Nemours, Inc. and/or Corteva, Inc. for certain liabilities. Where, in any forward-looking statement, an expectation or belief as to future results or events is expressed, such expectation or belief is based on the current plans and expectations of management and expressed in good faith and believed to have a reasonable basis, but there can be no assurance that the expectation or belief will result or be achieved or accomplished. A detailed discussion of principal risks and uncertainties which may cause actual results and events to differ materially from such forward-looking statements is included in the section titled “Risk Factors” contained in the company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021 and its subsequent reports on Form 10-Q and Form 8-K. These are not the only risks and uncertainties that Dow faces. There may be other risks and uncertainties that Dow is unable to identify at this time or that Dow does not currently expect to have a material impact on its business. If any of those risks or uncertainties develops into an actual event, it could have a material adverse effect on Dow’s business. Dow assumes no obligation to update or revise publicly any forward-looking statements whether because of new information, future events, or otherwise, except as required by securities and other applicable laws. ®™ Trademark of The Dow Chemical Company (“Dow”) or an affiliate of Dow Form No. 066-00397-01-0622\n"
