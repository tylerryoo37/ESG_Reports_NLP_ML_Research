for strong public private partnerships with governments, development partners and civil society organizations.', 'On the key topic of education, we also work together with the Ivorian government, foundations, peers and suppliers in the CLEF and ELAN initiatives led by the Jacobs Foundation.', 'Through these two initiatives, which aim to raise a total of CHF 150 million (~USD $150 million), Mondelēz International is investing CHF 3 million to address children’s inadequate access to quality education in cocoa-growing regions: a key root cause of child labor, which can only be addressed systemically.', 'The goal is to improve access and quality of education for 5 million children, reaching 90% of rural primary schools in Côte d’Ivoire through the construction of 2,500 classrooms, and tested interventions to improve teaching quality.', 'These initiatives will strengthen the Ivorian educational system and benefit children of cocoa farmers across the sector, including those in our supply chain.', 'Building on the success of this public-private initiative, we are encouraging the Jacobs Foundation to partner with the Ghanaian government to expand this initiative to our other key cocoa sourcing country, Ghana.', 'Taking Action on Palm Oil Through our POAP, we require suppliers to respect the labor rights of all workers and embed the CGF Priority Industry Principles against Forced Labor within both their own operations and their supply chains.', 'The POAP requires suppliers to provide annual assurance of continuous improvement, verified by third- party labor rights experts.', 'To support the mainstreaming of robust due diligence practices in the palm oil sector, we have joined forces with peers in the CGF Human Rights Coalition, the Fair Labor Association, and the International Organization for Migration to deploy and test systems at each stage of the supply chain.', 'Recognizing the systemic nature and its prevalence among migrant workers, we complement this support to palm oil suppliers with engagement of key actors of the Malaysian recruitment market, as well as joint advocacy towards the Malaysian government and the government of migrant workers’ country of origin.', 'Most of the world’s hazelnut production comes from Turkey.', 'Research, including studies conducted by the US Department of Labor and the Fair Labor Association have confirmed the risk of child labor in the Turkish hazelnut sector, which relies on migrant workers during the harvest season, who often travel to the hazelnut growing regions with their families.', 'To address this systemic issue, we joined CAOBISCO’s partnership with the International Labor Organization to combat child labor in seasonal harvesting.', 'This Public-Private Partnership Agreement contributes to overall policy advocacy and implementation, expansion of the knowledge base and improvement of institutional capacity for the elimination of child labor in the hazelnut sector.', 'Key outcomes from the program during the 2021 harvest season include awareness raising sessions with seasonal workers and their families, outreach to hazelnut orchard owners and labor intermediaries.', 'As a result, 1,456 children were removed or prevented from engaging in harvesting activities across the Black Sea region and benefited from educational activities.', 'Supporting Mandatory Due Diligence Recognizing the need for everyone involved to work together to tackle human rights issues in global supply chains and make good practices mainstream, we support legislative efforts to enable practical, proactive and ongoing human rights due diligence.', 'We welcome the European Union Commission’s proposed Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence directive (issued in February 2022), which will require companies to identify and address human rights and environmental risks in their value chain.', 'Human Rights (CONT.)', 'It’s very significant that Mondelēz was prepared to stick their head above the parapet and say: ‘actually, we need human rights due diligence to become mandatory, so that we can level the playing field and that all businesses start upholding human rights standards in their supply chain’.',

Healthy Lifestyles program, MIF has invested $50 million and partnered on a variety of programs to help children and their families adopt lifelong healthy habits.', 'Over the years, the impact has been considerable – a 34% increase in children knowing what good nutrition is, a 13% increase in children being physically active for at least 30 minutes a day, and a 25% increase in children eating more fruits, vegetables and other fresh foods.', 'Fighting Obesity and Improving Health The Healthy Lifestyles programs have normally been school based, reaching children aged 6-12, as well as their families and teachers.', 'Programs were rooted in a three-pronged approach that has been widely regarded as crucial for fighting obesity and improving children’s health: improving nutrition knowledge; physical activity; and access to nutritious foods, primarily fruits and vegetables.', 'Tracking Progress Each partner tracks and documents progress against a set of global healthy lifestyle metrics developed in partnership with experts from Yale School of Public Health.', 'More importantly, each program implements these common measures to evaluate all programs against the same global metrics.',

agriculture, food systems, nutrition, science, biodiversity, and environmental sustainability.', 'HIA South Africa followed a highly participatory and iterative approach that engaged school, community, and government stakeholders in the co- design of the program.', 'A key aspect of the program from its inception was its “climate-smart” aquaponics technology for increasing access to fresh, nutritious foods.', 'Similarly, HIA Brazil was an exemplar of how important it is to co-design school-based healthy lifestyles programs with local communities from the get-go.', 'The success was in establishing the produce gardens and getting not only the students, but also teachers, school principals, school food services, families, and communities engaged with them.', 'It had the added component of not only focusing on nutrition and obesity prevention, but also on other key public health problems affecting low- income children in Brazil.', 'The Mondelēz International Foundation and Fundación Huerta Niño partnership began in 2018 with the goal of improving nutritional knowledge, increasing physical activity amongst school-aged children, and promoting access to fresh produce of high nutritional quality for low- income children across Argentina.', 'The central concept of the program was the establishment of tailored garden spaces at each school site.', 'Experiential learning in the garden space was considered the basis of strengthening nutritional knowledge and the incorporation of healthy eating habits.', 'The project was highly innovative, as the produce gardens were co-designed with each respective community.', 'As a result, no two produce gardens were alike.', 'This degree of customization allowed for carefully adapting the produce gardens to the specific needs

cocoa sourcing country, Ghana.', 'Taking Action on Palm Oil Through our POAP, we require suppliers to respect the labor rights of all workers and embed the CGF Priority Industry Principles against Forced Labor within both their own operations and their supply chains.', 'The POAP requires suppliers to provide annual assurance of continuous improvement, verified by third- party labor rights experts.', 'To support the mainstreaming of robust due diligence practices in the palm oil sector, we have joined forces with peers in the CGF Human Rights Coalition, the Fair Labor Association, and the International Organization for Migration to deploy and test systems at each stage of the supply chain.', 'Recognizing the systemic nature and its prevalence among migrant workers, we complement this support to palm oil suppliers with engagement of key actors of the Malaysian recruitment market, as well as joint advocacy towards the Malaysian government and the government of migrant workers’ country of origin.', 'Most of the world’s hazelnut production comes from Turkey.', 'Research, including studies conducted by the US Department of Labor and the Fair Labor Association have confirmed the risk of child labor in the Turkish hazelnut sector, which relies on migrant workers during the harvest season, who often travel to the hazelnut growing regions with their families.', 'To address this systemic issue, we joined CAOBISCO’s partnership with the International Labor Organization to combat child labor in seasonal harvesting.', 'This Public-Private Partnership Agreement contributes to overall policy advocacy and implementation, expansion of the knowledge base and improvement of institutional capacity for the elimination of child labor in the hazelnut sector.', 'Key outcomes from the program during the 2021 harvest season include awareness raising sessions with seasonal workers and their families, outreach to hazelnut orchard owners and labor intermediaries.', 'As a result, 1,456 children were removed or prevented from engaging in harvesting activities across the Black Sea region and benefited from educational activities.', 'Supporting Mandatory Due Diligence Recognizing the need for everyone involved to work together to tackle human rights issues in global supply chains and make good practices mainstream, we support legislative efforts to enable practical, proactive

verified programs through our suppliers.', 'By 2025, we aim to achieve 100% sourcing visibility in Côte d’Ivoire and Ghana by requiring that 100% of farmers producing Hershey’s cocoa volume in these countries are: • Polygon mapped by our suppliers to improve traceability and monitor deforestation; and • Covered by Child Labor Monitoring and Remediation Systems (CLMRS) to prevent, monitor and remediate child labor.', 'Farmer groups and farmers participating in our Cocoa For Good strategy in Côte d’Ivoire and Ghana together supply a significant amount of the cocoa we purchase worldwide.', 'Clear visibility into how and under what conditions the cocoa we source is grown and cultivated enables us to implement programs that focus on helping to improve farmer incomes, eliminate child labor and protect the environment.', 'Understanding the origin of cocoa is essential to ensure that it meets our human rights and environmental requirements.', 'Responsibly sourcing cocoa and prioritizing our human rights and environmental requirements requires collaboration between the public and private sectors including governments, our suppliers, farmers and manufacturers.', 'Our commitment to improve farmer livelihoods and incomes is unwavering, and we will continue to drive our requirements and evolve as we learn to benefit farmers, their families and their communities.', 'As of December 2021, we achieved 68% sourcing visibility of our cocoa volume originating from Côte d’Ivoire and Ghana, on track to reaching our 2025 commitment.', 'While Côte d’Ivoire and Ghana continue to be the countries where the majority of our programming is focused, in 2021 we continued implementing Cocoa For Good in Brazil, Cameroon, Ecuador, Indonesia, Mexico and Nigeria, increasing the number of farmers participating in programs as part of Cocoa For Good worldwide by 24%.', '68% sourcing visibility in Côte d’Ivoire and Ghana 22 The Hershey Company | 2021 ESG Report The Big Picture Our Company Cocoa Responsible Sourcing and Human Rights Environment Our People Youth Community About This Report Cocoa', 'Accountability, Transparency and Due Diligence in Cocoa Hershey takes a comprehensive approach to human rights due diligence in cocoa.', 'This process covers country-of-origin risk assessments and a supplier sustainability assessment — the Hershey Company Sustainability Assessment — that evaluates suppliers’ policy commitments and management systems to address topics like child labor, forced labor, grievance mechanisms and living income.', 'The results of the assessment are incorporated into our overall engagement with suppliers, including performance conversations with a mindset of continuous improvement.', 'We currently have action plans in place with suppliers for 2021–2023 that cover the majority of our cocoa volume needs.', 'We will continue to review the assessment action plans through our ongoing supplier engagement conversations.', 'We also continued to increase our accountability and transparency by publishing the farmer groups whose cocoa beans have entered our supply chain.', 'The survey enables us to: • Better understand and assess our direct suppliers’ commitments and actions around responsibly sourcing cocoa.', '• Identify potential risks within Hershey’s value chain.', '• Identify areas for improvement and work with our suppliers on their responsible sourcing journey.', '23 The Hershey Company | 2021 ESG Report The Big Picture Our Company Cocoa Responsible Sourcing and Human Rights Environment Our People Youth Community About This Report Cocoa', 'Hershey does not tolerate child labor and/or forced labor within our value chain and has formed strategic partnerships with communities, NGOs, governments and suppliers to eliminate it from occurring within cocoa communities.', 'In cocoa-growing communities, child labor is a complex issue resulting from a mix of poverty, cultural norms and misunderstandings about what constitutes appropriate child work.', 'In many communities, child-appropriate work on the family farm or in the household is an important part of young people’s learning and cultural development.', 'However, a lack of stable income and educational opportunities in rural areas can lead families to depend on children putting in long hours at home and on the farms, which are often the families’ sole source of income.', 'Paired with lack of awareness about appropriate work, this puts children at risk of performing farm work that is hazardous to their health and development.', 'Not only does child labor pose a potential danger to children, it also plays a role in further entrenching intergenerational poverty in rural communities.', 'Hershey has developed a multifaceted approach that includes improving community and farmer awareness.', 'We also invest in preventive, supplier-led approaches that monitor farmers to check that child labor is not occurring and providing resources and oversight to help remediate instances of child labor if they are found.', 'Identifying and Addressing Child Labor Our regular review of key risks in the cocoa supply chain (as outlined in our cocoa due diligence process on page 23) continues to highlight the importance of monitoring, preventing and remediating instances of child labor.', 'CLMRS, championed by the ICI and proven to be an effective measure in helping to protect against child labor, is the leading method of child labor detection and remediation among children aged 5–17 years old.', 'It is implemented by supply chain partners and community-based groups that identify child labor and monitor and help remediate when cases are found.', 'Supply chain partners are responsible for collecting and reporting on this data.', 'Hershey began implementing industry aligned best practice CLMRS executed by supply chain and community partners in 2018.', 'Supply chain and community partners identify potential child labor situations and investigate, monitor and remediate when cases are found.', 'For Hershey, “remediated” means that through our supply chain partners a child has received mitigation efforts appropriate to their situation, such as being enrolled in school.', 'As a result, the child no longer participates in activities defined as child labor and is no longer at risk of being enlisted to undertake these activities.', 'Due to case-by-case differences between child labor situations, remediation can be done at the child, household or community level.', 'Remediation responsiveness, therefore, can range from almost instant (e.g., household awareness training that is conducted when data is collected and/or cases found) to 6–18 months (e.g., renovation of classrooms or school canteens to get kids back to school).', 'Children identified as victims of child labor receive two or three follow-up visits over several months to establish whether they are out of child labor.', 'Continued monitoring then reveals whether those children stay out of child labor consistently or are identified once more engaging in potentially hazardous activities.', 'Working to Eliminate Child Labor What Is Child Labor?', 'Hershey uses the International Labour Organization (ILO) definition: Child labor is work that is mentally, physically, socially or morally dangerous and harmful to children and/or interferes with their schooling.', 'Not all work performed by children, such as helping their parents around the home and assisting in a family business, is classified as child labor.', 'Such activities are sometimes referred to as “light work.” The worst forms of child labor put children at the greatest risk and are the highest priority for elimination.', 'Most instances of inappropriate child labor involve tasks such as carrying heavy loads like firewood or water, contact with agrochemicals or clearing of land with sharp tools.', 'Child labor is distinct from forced labor, which is defined by the ILO as: Situations in which persons are coerced to work through the use of violence or intimidation, or by more subtle means such as accumulated debt, retention of identity papers or threats of denunciation to immigration authorities.', 'Hershey is a member of ICI’s Forced Labor Sub-Group, working with our peers and technical experts to advance knowledge, skills, and action on preventing, monitoring, identifying and addressing forced labor in cocoa supply chains.', '24 The Hershey Company | 2021 ESG Report The Big Picture Our Company Cocoa Responsible Sourcing and Human Rights Environment Our People Youth Community About This Report Cocoa', 'How CLMRS Is Helping Keep Kids Safe 1 2 3 4 5 Community facilitators visit every farm assigned to their farmer group Any child involved in hazardous activity is identified and information about his/her situation is recorded in a centralized database The report is verified Children and their families receive remediation support from supply chain facilitators and NGO partners or are referred to public services, an approach that is aligned with practices recommended by the ILO The data is used to design actions in support of children identified We also support the establishment of community-level child protection committees.', 'Composed of trusted community members, these groups are in the best position to raise awareness, identify cases of child labor and implement the most appropriate practices to remediate those cases.', 'Depending on the type of child labor detected, remediation support is conducted at the child, household or community level.', 'Successful child labor remediation strategies vary and need to respond to the needs of individual children and their families.', 'They may also be dependent upon the presence of government social welfare agencies to which cases can be referred for additional follow-up by local authorities.', 'By increasing farmers’ awareness of what constitutes child labor (such as children carrying heavy loads and being exposed to farm pesticides) and improving farmers’ and families’ ease and efficiency of completing tasks around the farm, children are less likely to participate in dangerous farm tasks.', 'What’s Next We will continue to invest funds to improve the quality of CLMRS and to expand it with the aim of ensuring that no child is overlooked, and everyone receives the support they need.', 'Our CLMRS covered 62% of Hershey cocoa volumes, on the way to achieving our goal of 100% by 2025.', 'As of 2021, Hershey’s CLMRS found no evidence of forced child labor in our programs in Côte d’Ivoire and Ghana.', 'Almost 2,000 children were either remediated or have aged out of the CLMRS.', 'To see our key performance metrics from the year, see page 31.', '62% of Hershey

able to attend school and by encouraging school attendance through our school feeding initiative.', 'We focus significant resources and effort on making it easier for children to access and continue their education, such as by improving education infrastructure, training school-parent management committees, providing school kits filled with important school supplies, distributing vitamin-fortified, peanut-based, ready-to-use therapeutic food to schoolchildren and helping children and youth obtain birth certificates for school enrollment.', 'In October 2021, we signed a five-year agreement with the Jacobs Foundation, the Government of Côte d’Ivoire Ministry of Education and Literacy, and 14 other chocolate producers and cocoa suppliers to implement the Child Learning and Education Facility (CLEF).', 'This new public-private initiative will contribute to improved foundational literacy and numeracy skills for five million children at primary school level and includes an investment in 2,500 new classrooms.', 'Addressing Child Labor Through School-Based Nutrition Not only does a full stomach improve a student’s ability to concentrate and learn, it can also be the deciding factor between whether or not a child attends school.', 'In collaboration with Ghana’s Ministry of Gender, Children and Social Protection, the Ghana National School Feeding Programme and our suppliers, Hershey has been distributing ViVi daily to school children in cocoa-growing communities in Ghana since 2015.', 'ViVi, developed by Hershey and our partner Project Peanut Butter, provides children with 30% of their daily nutritional intake requirements.', 'In 2021, we reached approximately 25,000 children daily in Ghana.', 'In addition, ViVi is produced in Ghana in a factory that employs 30 local men and women and provides a secure market for more than 20 Ghanaian peanut farmers.', 'In February 2021, production and distribution began in Côte d’Ivoire, thanks to a partnership with the country’s National Nutrition Council and a new Hershey-funded ViVi factory at San Pedro, in southwestern Côte d’Ivoire.', 'The trial distribution reached 2,552 students.', 'By September 2021, distribution expanded to reach 20,000 school children daily in the regions of San Pedro and Haut-Sassandra.', 'We expect further growth of the project in Côte d’Ivoire in 2022.', 'Knowing that children will be fed at school is another reason to ensure they go to class rather than to work, making it an important preventive tool in the fight against child labor.1 Research

negotiating power for farmers to set crop prices, a singular reliance on cocoa for income, falling cocoa yields as cocoa trees age, illiteracy, a lack of proper business and financial training and persistently disempowered women.', 'Additionally, we know that the cycle of poverty continues to exacerbate the existence of child labor and deforestation in these communities.', 'Our aim is to support cocoa farmers’ transition out of poverty, and we support development of multiple opportunities to increase income and build resilience.', 'Supporting the Development of Farmer Groups Farmer groups are essential platforms for farmers to unify their voices to increase their earning potential and economic resilience.', 'In 2021, through Cocoa For Good, Hershey expanded its support to 102 farmer groups, reaching more than 94,300 farmers through our suppliers across seven origins.', 'Our support has assisted these farmer groups and farmers in receiving independent verification of their cocoa in compliance with credible sustainability standards.', 'This action not only helped us reach our goal of sourcing 100% independently verified cocoa but also ensures the farmer groups and farmers are paid a higher premium for their harvests.', 'Farmers receive direct cash payouts from the certification premium, which enables them to reinvest in their farms and their families.', 'At the group level, the certification premium is used to further strengthen the resiliency of the group as a whole through investment in shared equipment and capacity building, like training on climate-smart cocoa techniques and income- diversification opportunities.', 'Improving Income Through Farm Development Plans We support farmers in achieving economic gains by actively exploring how to improve their farming practices through creation of tailored farm development plans.', 'Through Cocoa For Good and associated farmer groups, farmers have access to higher-yielding cocoa varieties and are trained on the proper pruning of shade and cocoa trees, fertilization and irrigation, and weed and disease control.', 'Farmer group members also have improved access to credit and loans to make further investments in their farms.', 'In 2021, this support included more than 31,000 farm development plans.', 'Supporting Income Diversification To help diversify economic opportunities, we support cocoa community members in developing alternative means of generating income.', 'In 2021, more than 2,600 community members were trained in alternative income- generating opportunities, such as soap making and cassava processing.', 'Lifting up Rural Livelihoods 27 The Hershey Company | 2021 ESG Report The Big Picture Our Company Cocoa Responsible Sourcing and Human Rights Environment Our People Youth Community About This Report Cocoa', 'Supporting Women in Achieving Economic Independence Village Savings and Loan Associations (VSLAs) are a simple, accessible way to help individuals — especially women — and communities learn about saving, borrowing and investing responsibly.', 'The groups’ members are likely to be either completely unbanked or unable to qualify for a loan through traditional financial providers.', 'In VSLAs, loans are based on trust among group members.', 'The groups also create a small solidarity fund that is dispensed either for collective problems (such as repairing a village water pump) or individual emergencies.', 'Hershey now directly supports nearly 200 VSLAs with 5,879 members, 79% of whom are women.', 'Thanks to collective savings, the VSLAs provided an invaluable source of funds to boost financial resilience and security during the pandemic.', 'Empowering Youth To break the intergenerational cycle of poverty, today’s youth in cocoa communities (defined as 15- to 35-year-olds) need to be equipped with life skills, technical and vocational skills and the practical knowledge and tools needed to become self-sufficient community leaders of the future.', 'We support youth economic empowerment through access to vocational training, land tenure documents and the development of income-earning opportunities such as community pruning teams.', 'Pruning teams are groups of up to 10 young adults who help provide essential pruning services to cocoa farmers in their communities.', 'Regular pruning of cocoa trees helps to prevent tree mold and diseases and reduces the need for farmers to apply agrochemicals and pesticides.', 'In addition to providing an invaluable service to farmers, in 2021, these community pruning teams provided 372 young adults (39 of them women) in cocoa-growing communities with valuable skills and knowledge about cocoa farming, while also helping to support their families with extra income.', 'Continuing Our Work to Understand and Promote Farmer Incomes In 2021, we published our Living Wage & Income Position Statement and began taking additional steps to understand the gaps between farmers’ current income and a living income.', 'Working with the research firm Ipsos, we implemented a new biannual impact assessment methodology to capture data on farmer and household income.', 'This research will allow us to measure the efficacy of our programs in addressing farmer livelihoods, including improving income.', 'In conducting our research, we use benchmarks endorsed by the Living Income Community of Practice (LICOP), which defines living income as: “The net annual income required for a household in a particular place to afford a decent standard of living for all members of that household.” Collection of baseline data was completed in late 2021 for Côte d’Ivoire and will finish in Ghana in early 2022.', 'Initial results suggest that while only a small percentage of cocoa farming households earn a household income above the Living Income Benchmark, the majority are above the national poverty line in Côte d’Ivoire.', 'Further analysis will be focused on better understanding how the Cocoa For Good program can support farmer livelihoods to increase the percentage of households above the Living Income threshold.', 'For our key performance metrics from the year, see page 31.', '28 The Hershey Company | 2021 ESG Report The Big Picture Our Company Cocoa Responsible Sourcing and Human Rights Environment Our People Youth Community About This Report Cocoa', 'In cocoa-growing regions in West Africa, deforestation and biodiversity loss are a manifestation of a complex set of root causes including poverty, the absence of land titles, a lack of clarity on land tenure arrangements, limited knowledge of good agricultural practices and resource-challenged law enforcement agencies.', 'To stop deforestation in our supply chain, Hershey is investing in helping farmers secure land titles where they farm, spreading climate- positive farming methods and investing in protecting the uniquely rich ecosystems where cocoa is produced in Côte d’Ivoire and Ghana.', 'Since 2018, Hershey has publicly committed to no new deforestation in our global cocoa supply chain and to implementing shade-grown cocoa with agroforestry tree-planting programs.', 'In 2021, Hershey supported the nationwide “1 Day, 50 Million Trees” reforestation campaign led by the Ministry of Water Resources and Forests in Côte d’Ivoire.', 'Farm Locations and Deforestation Throughout the past few years we funded comprehensive mapping of cocoa farms in Côte d’Ivoire and Ghana where our suppliers source the cocoa volume used in Hershey products.', 'The mapping provides a baseline deforestation rate through measuring annual tree cover loss and closely monitoring farm locations for encroachment into protected forest areas.', 'Securing Land Titles to Unlock Land Value Without proper land titles, it is difficult for farmers to access financing or make necessary changes on their farms to prevent deforestation, promote reforestation and apply agroforestry and climate-smart cocoa farming.', 'Through our partnership with the USAID Integrated Land and Resource Governance (ILRG) Project, we support communities in Ghana to clarify and document land rights as well as improve land-use planning practices through agroforestry.', 'In 2021, our engagement with ILRG and one of our suppliers, ECOM, assisted 1,244 farmers in acquiring land title documentation.', 'In 2020, we co-launched with the German Agency for International Cooperation (GIZ), the Government of Côte d’Ivoire and other partners the Côte d’Ivoire Land Partnership program (CLAP) to promote affordable land titling as a catalyst for halting deforestation.', 'Due to our intervention and design of relevant land tenure documents that are government sanctioned and community accepted, this partnership was able to shorten the time of delivery and costs of securing land titles, greatly improving farmers’ access.', 'In addition, in Zégo, a town in Côte d’Ivoire’s Lôh-Djiboua region, CLAP provided members of the village land management committee with technical training on the use of GPS devices to record land rights, with a special focus on land- use contracts with tenants.', 'Benefiting from fit-for-purpose technology, community members can now record land rights locally and formalize owner-tenant agreements, something previously cost-prohibitive for these communities.', 'Continuing Our Landscape Programs We continued our Kakum Agroforestry Landscape Program partnership in Ghana, which covers an area equivalent to 20 times the size of Manhattan and includes the Kakum National Park, an intact tropical rainforest covering 145 square miles (375 square kilometers) that is home to antelopes, elephants, monkeys and a number of other endangered wildlife species.', 'This partnership promotes and supports community-led landscape management, spreads climate-smart cocoa- growing practices and provides training for extra income-generating activities.', 'Fighting Deforestation 29 The Hershey Company | 2021 ESG Report The Big Picture Our Company Cocoa Responsible Sourcing and Human Rights Environment Our People Youth Community About This Report Cocoa', 'Promoting Cocoa Agroforestry in Ghana The Kakum Cocoa Agroforestry Landscape Project engages the chocolate and cocoa sector companies along with the Ghana Cocoa Board, Ghana Forestry Commission and the Nature Conservation Research Centre.', 'The project fosters sustainability at a landscape scale — both on farms and across the surrounding expanse of cocoa and forest lands — in the environment surrounding world-renowned Kakum National Park, in Ghana’s Central Region.', 'The initiative supports the development of an innovative community-based landscape governance system to improve natural resource management, reduce deforestation and enhance forest protection.', 'At the same time, it aims to expand cocoa agroforestry practices and income diversification through emerging botanical supply chains.', 'So far, the project has developed management plans covering nearly 40,000 hectares of cocoa, food crop and forest- fallow lands in more than 80 communities that border the Kakum National Park.', 'In addition, the project is implementing cocoa agroforestry activities and climate-smart interventions that benefit thousands of cocoa farmers and their communities.', 'This includes planting more than 30,000 multi- purpose shade tree seedlings since 2018.', 'Many farmers in these communities have also benefited from income diversification through harvesting and selling kombo nuts.', 'Over the long term, the project will transform the Kakum cocoa-forest landscape toward a more sustainable agroforestry system, in which forests are protected, cocoa farmers and their families experience improved well-being and empowerment, and socio- economic and ecological resilience to climate change across the landscape is strengthened.', 'Promoting Climate-Smart Cocoa As we help more farmers to gain control of their land, we are also promoting climate-smart growing techniques.', 'In 2021, 41% of Cocoa For Good farmers in Côte d’Ivoire and Ghana were trained on climate-smart cocoa using a curriculum Hershey helped develop.', 'We anticipate expanding access to this training by making the content available via a free app.', 'Cocoa For Good farmers worked on 219,321 hectares of cocoa area across seven origins in line with sustainable farming practice, including promoting shade grown agroforestry, specific tree species, tree handling and planting and the management of trees after planting.', 'Find out more about our progress against public targets in Hershey’s dedicated CFI reports.', 'What’s Next We will continue our engagement in our current landscape initiative and are exploring new landscape

Hershey recognizes the importance of engaging with those who are impacted by our work — from farmers and their communities to our employees, consumers and others.', 'We have identified vulnerable stakeholders and tailor our methods and frequency of engagement to their individual needs to maximize our impact.', 'We partner with suppliers and multiple NGOs on issues such as deforestation and child labor.', 'In addition, we participate in several industry forums to promote dialogue and help drive the uptake of best practices.', 'Our Hershey team members, suppliers and NGO partners also conduct regular visits with cocoa farmers and their communities throughout the year.', 'Hershey maintains ongoing investment in sustainability programs, including CLMRS and other initiatives under our Cocoa For Good program.', 'We engage workers and farmers directly through on-site and mobile surveys.', 'To obtain direct feedback from our employees on their working experience, we hold regular town halls and conduct quarterly pulse surveys.', 'Direct Worker Engagement “Worker Voice” Hershey recognizes the importance of tools that directly engage workers and farmers on their experience.', 'In 2021, we piloted three worker engagement surveys in India, Malaysia and Côte d’Ivoire that empowered more than 712 contract, temporary workers and farmers to share their experience of being part of Hershey’s supply chain.', 'The surveys covered topics such as the recruitment process, contract transparency, working hours, wages, discrimination and harassment, freedom of movement, grievance mechanisms and overall well-being.', 'In India, we found that a small group of workers had paid nominal fees for their uniforms — these were immediately repaid.', 'New controls were put in place to ensure that this practice is not used again by any of the recruitment agencies we work with.', 'Additionally, we implemented a new electronic badging system to ensure that contract workers always maintain possession of their identity documents while still being able to meet the facility’s food safety quality requirements.', 'In India, we also implemented new training for agency workers on the Hershey’s Concern Line — and raised awareness of it through more on-site posters — and trained agencies on Hershey’s grievance procedures.', '712 contract and temporary workers and farmers shared their experience of being part of Hershey’s supply chain Ensuring Responsible Recruitment and Preventing Forced Labor Our Approach We’re building the capacity of labor agencies to strengthen management systems that promote responsible recruitment.', 'This includes labor agency completion of a Self-Assessment Questionnaire (SAQ) and Hershey desktop verification of their policies and procedures to understand how our expectations are being upheld.', 'We developed guidance training that we shared with smaller agencies to help them identify root causes of nonconformities and implement effective corrective actions.', 'We continue to offer all labor agencies in the program access to RLI’s E-Learning Academy.', 'Our Achievements • Completed due diligence on 68 labor agencies in Brazil, Canada, India, Malaysia, Mexico and the U.S. • Conducted human rights assessments and Sedex Members Ethical Trade Audit (SMETA) 2-Pillar audits on our labor agencies in Malaysia to identify improvement opportunities.', '• Remediated 86% of the findings identified in desktop due diligence, with the remainder in progress.', 'We Support: • The Employer Pays Principle • The Consumer Goods

business may cause or may contribute to adverse human rights impacts.', 'We also use our influence with suppliers and business partners to encourage the provision of remedy when we find issues linked to our supply chain.', 'We implemented mechanisms that enable our employees and other individuals in our supply chain to report grievances and seek resolution.', 'Our mechanisms do not prevent complainants from using other channels or procedures, such as local law enforcement agencies, to resolve their issue where relevant.', 'We also partner with other organizations to help prevent, mitigate and remedy adverse human rights impacts.', 'Some of our primary grievance mechanisms include: • Hershey’s Concern Line (available in more than 47 languages), which is primarily geared toward our employees but is also accessible to our suppliers and other stakeholders.', '• The requirement that our direct suppliers have grievance mechanisms, which we validate via social compliance audits and our cocoa and palm oil supplier sustainability assessments.', '• Our public Palm Oil Grievance Process.', '• Grievance mechanisms made available through certification bodies or standards- setting organizations.', 'Some specific examples of how we provided remedy in 2021 include: • Repayment of the cost of uniforms to contract workers in our India facility.', '• Provision of birth certificates, school kits and bridging classes through the CLMRS system.', 'More detailed information on our human rights due diligence approach, the results of our risk assessment process and our work with Verité can be found on our website and in our Modern Slavery Statement.', 'Training To fully embed a human rights culture within our company and across our value chain, we have committed to training 100% of our procurement professionals on human rights.', 'The training covers Hershey’s salient human rights issues — including forced labor and child labor — the UNGPs, human rights considerations in purchasing practices and how to be an internal champion for human rights.', 'In 2021, we maintained our commitment to training 100% of procurement professionals on human rights.', 'We also expanded the requirement to our international supply chain and licensing teams as well as to The Hershey Experience, our global retail operations.', 'As of December 2021, 93% of required Hershey employees have taken the human rights training and have achieved the required score of 80% or higher to pass.', 'Since its launch, nearly 1,400 Hershey employees have successfully completed the training.', '36 The

Hershey followed the guidance of the UNGPs to determine where individuals are most likely to experience wage and income-related vulnerabilities, particularly where Hershey has significant leverage and influence.', 'This resulted in our new Living Wage & Income Position Statement.', 'In 2021, we furthered our commitment to promoting living wages globally by: • Reviewing all our global full-time

Our global network of owned operations, suppliers and business partners are critical to how we ethically and sustainably provide great- tasting, high-quality products to our consumers.', 'Hershey facilities undergo a SMETA 4-Pillar audit1 every three years, or more frequently as needed based on issue remediation or customer requests.', 'Through our Responsible Sourcing Supplier Program (Supplier Program), we verify and monitor our Tier 1 suppliers’ compliance with our SCOC.', 'The Supplier Program is aligned with our human rights saliency assessment, uses independent third-party verification tools, including SMETA 4-Pillar audits, to monitor compliance and proactively identifies opportunities for future due diligence.', 'We support suppliers’ continual improvement through corrective action plans and capacity building.', 'The Supplier Program helps strengthen the long-term sustainability of our supply chain.', 'By the end of 2021, we achieved our goal of enrolling 100% of the 450 high-risk suppliers and sites that were prioritized for due diligence.', 'Prioritization was based on our initial risk assessment of 1,300 direct raw material and packaging suppliers, as well as co- manufacturers, copackers, licensees and The Hershey Experience vendors.', 'We are on track to achieve our goal of 85% of in scope supplier sites demonstrating compliance with our program requirements through achieving green audit results.', 'By the end of 2021, 25% of suppliers had achieved a green audit result.', 'Our 2021 Progress Enhancing Supplier Screening We refreshed our risk assessment across more than 900 suppliers not initially enrolled and included new areas within our company, such as our World Travel Retail Group.', 'We integrated responsible sourcing and human rights risk screening into our ingredient supplier and co-manufacturing/packaging qualification process.', 'Prior to entering into a commercial relationship, suppliers respond to questions about their management systems related to human rights, labor topics and ingredient certifications as required in our supplier and ingredient information forms and pre-audit checklist.', 'Supplier self-assessment questionnaires and social compliance audits are also reviewed.', 'This screening has been successful in identifying risks, resulting in 6% of suppliers not being approved for use due to human rights or environmental risks.', 'Supplier Engagement and Training We engaged with suppliers to assess links between purchasing practices and social compliance through the Better Buying Institute’s Partnership Index survey.', 'A total of 142 enrolled suppliers were invited to respond to the 12-question survey and provide feedback on Hershey’s buying practices.', 'We are analyzing feedback to understand best practices and continuous improvement opportunities related to how our buying practices can impact the financial, environmental and social sustainability of our suppliers.', 'We

ingredient.', 'For more details, see our Cocoa chapter, beginning on page 20.', 'Fostering Sustainable Agricultural Communities Through Our Priority Ingredients In 2020, we analyzed the global environmental and social risks known in our ingredients and raw materials supply chains alongside spend data to identify priority supply chains for responsible sourcing due diligence, investment and programming.', 'We identified five priorities: cocoa, dairy, sugar, palm oil, and pulp and paper.', 'This prioritization helps us target where we can make the biggest impact while reducing risks in our supply chain.', 'After achieving many of our 2020 responsible sourcing ingredient commitments, in 2021, we established new and ambitious goals and strategies across our priority ingredients and materials.', 'Our responsible sourcing commitments account for social and environmental challenges faced in the communities and ecosystems where our priority ingredients and materials come from.', 'While working with suppliers and farmers to address these issues, we implement a variety of tools and approaches including: • Traceability1: improving visibility within our ingredient and raw material supply chains back to origin to understand opportunities for impact.', '• Supplier engagement, monitoring and verification: communicating our expectations to suppliers and strengthening their sustainability management while using third-party certification and verification schemes to monitor performance and drive continuous improvement across sustainability impact areas.', '• Origin-level and transformation investments: investing in Hershey, supplier and other partner-led origin-level programs focused on environmental, social and economic issues.', '• Industry engagement: participating in industry-wide partnerships to enable systemic change, as companies cannot solve these complex sustainability challenges alone.', 'In 2022, we will refresh our priority ingredients risk assessment to account for 1) changes in our supply chain, including the acquisitions of Lily’s, Dot’s and Pretzels; 2) developments in our human rights and environmental strategies, such as the intersection with nature and water; and 3) changes in sustainability risks.', 'For a summary of our goals and KPIs related to responsible sourcing, see page 43.', '1 Traceability is not a chain of custody concept and

to the mill level and understand if it is linked to areas or mills with sustainability concerns such as deforestation, water pollution or the exploitation of workers.', 'For the year 2020, 60% of the sugar we purchased was traceable to the mill and we expect a similar percentage of our volumes to be traceable for 2021.', 'To monitor and verify sustainability performance at the mill level and farm level of our sugar supply chain, we continued to use credible third-party standards and verification mechanisms, including the Bonsucro and Fair Trade USA certifications for our sugar cane.', 'In 2021, these actions included: • Continuing to source 100% Bonsucro-certified mass balance sugar for our plants in Canada and Brazil.', '• Working with our suppliers to increase the volume of Bonsucro-certified mass balance sugar for our plants in the U.S. and to initiate the purchase of some Bonsucro-certified mass balance volumes for our operations in India.', '• Purchasing Bonsucro credits to match 100% of the volumes of conventional sugar purchased from non-U.S. origins where certified mass balance sugar was not available, as well as 20% of our total U.S.-produced sugar volumes.', 'We sourced a total of 62% of our sugar volumes from farms certified or verified to a recognized sustainability standard or covered by Bonsucro credits.', 'We aim to procure 100% of our sugar from sources certified or verified to a recognized sustainability standard covering the farm level by 2025.', 'For more information, visit our Sugar Sourcing webpage.', 'In 2022, we will initiate an annual survey of our direct suppliers’ sustainability and responsible sourcing practices and management systems.', 'Our aim is to open a dialogue between Hershey and our suppliers for sharing concerns and best practices and identifying where training and investment is needed.', 'This will be an important tool for better understanding our suppliers’ business practices, areas for improvement and issues to monitor.', 'Hershey continues to partner with our supplier, American Sugar Refining (ASR), to implement the “Learn to Grow” programs in Belize and Mexico that deploy a farmer field school model to help farmers learn about and implement more sustainable growing practices.', 'These programs aim to holistically address environmental and social issues facing the farmers enrolled, including by supporting the development of a standard labor contract between the participating cane cutters and cane farmer associations that provide cane to mills that supply to Hershey via ASR.', 'In 2021, our program in Belize initiated a new phase to help farmers adapt to climate change through the use of technology that enables them to predict changing weather and pest patterns.', 'Training on best management practices was also provided to help them respond more effectively to these challenges.', 'Dairy In 2021, we began implementing our responsible sourcing strategy for dairy.', 'We joined the Dairy Sustainability Alliance®, an initiative organized by the Innovation Center for U.S.', 'Dairy, to accelerate progress toward common sustainability goals and contribute to the long-term viability of the U.S. dairy industry.', 'In doing so, we endorsed the 11 key sustainability criteria and strategic intents of the global Dairy Sustainability Framework.', 'We also joined the Sustainable Agriculture Initiative Platform’s Sustainable Dairy Partnership (SDP).', 'We use this to verify our dairy supply chain’s compliance with our sustainability policies and engage with our suppliers on their journey toward more sustainable dairy production.', 'The SDP includes sustainability requirements that must be met by dairy processors and supplying farms as well as an assurance model with third-party verification and progress reporting.', 'We have committed to sourcing 100% of our dairy volumes from suppliers enrolled in and assessed through the SDP by 2024.', 'At the end of 2021, 80% of our volumes were sourced from such suppliers.', 'We also help suppliers accelerate their sustainability efforts by investing with them in field-level interventions focused on our priority issues.', 'In 2021, we collaborated with Land O’Lakes, our highest-volume dairy supplier and a strategic partner, and the Alliance for the Chesapeake Bay to launch a three-year pilot program, Sustainable Dairy PA.', 'This program aims to reduce GHG emissions and protect water quality across dairy farms in our Pennsylvania supply chain.', 'Hershey will provide funding to support the implementation of manure storage facilities, soil health practices, riparian forest buffers and other efforts to enhance sustainability on our supplying farms.', 'Our work in 2021 included 16 acres of riparian buffer planted — that’s 4,160 trees — and over a mile of stream coverage and fencing constructed, among other projects.', 'This will prevent over 41,000 pounds of sediment, 2,250 pounds of

signature sourcing program Cocoa Life — is an excellent example.', 'As one of the world’s leading chocolate makers, cocoa is essential to our business.', 'Looking after this core ingredient by developing more sustainable farming practices and positively contributing to the livelihoods of cocoa farming communities is arguably our single biggest opportunity to have a positive impact on people and the planet.', '10 years ago, we pioneered our own program, Cocoa Life, because certification labels didn’t go far enough in addressing the underlying, interrelated issues in cocoa.', 'We wanted to tackle the challenges on the ground in the most effective way.', 'Created with third-party experts, Cocoa Life is integrated into our business strategy, funded through our chocolate business, driven by impact data and continuous learning, and independently verified by outside, third-party verification.', 'As part of our journey to lead a thriving cocoa sector, in 2012, we committed to invest $400 million over 10 years to empower 200,000 cocoa farmers and improve the lives of approximately one million people living in cocoa communities.', 'And in 2019, we set a new goal to source 100% of our cocoa volumes for chocolate brands through Cocoa Life by 2025.', '10 years on, we have delivered on our original 2022 goals, and are well on the way to meeting our 2025 goal – 75% of our 2021 cocoa volumes for chocolate brands is sourced through Cocoa Life, including 100% for our much-loved global chocolate brands such as Cadbury Dairy Milk, Côte d’Or, Milka and Toblerone.', 'We have been making ongoing progress against our goals to improve yields, improve farmer incomes, reduce deforestation, empower women to create additional sources of income, and encourage more children to attend school.', 'Importantly, our impact data – the only impact data publicly published across our industry – confirms our program is having the positive impact we want to see, and we are learning, improving and scaling up our signature sourcing programs, informed by this data.', 'Cocoa Life has made the difference on the ground in three key areas: • Creating more sustainable cocoa farming businesses – Increased Cocoa Life farmer net incomes in West Africa by +15% in Ghana and +33% in Côte d’Ivoire • Strengthening cocoa communities – 96% (2,482) of communities with Community Action Plans (CAPs) in place, of which 70% are supported by local governments • Conserving and restoring forests – We see near to no deforestation in close proximity to our Cocoa Life farms in West Africa

This Report Cocoa', 'Hershey does not tolerate child labor and/or forced labor within our value chain and has formed strategic partnerships with communities, NGOs, governments and suppliers to eliminate it from occurring within cocoa communities.', 'In cocoa-growing communities, child labor is a complex issue resulting from a mix of poverty, cultural norms and misunderstandings about what constitutes appropriate child work.', 'In many communities, child-appropriate work on the family farm or in the household is an important part of young people’s learning and cultural development.', 'However, a lack of stable income and educational opportunities in rural areas can lead families to depend on children putting in long hours at home and on the farms, which are often the families’ sole source of income.', 'Paired with lack of awareness about appropriate work, this puts children at risk of performing farm work that is hazardous to their health and development.', 'Not only does child labor pose a potential danger to children, it also plays a role in further entrenching intergenerational poverty in rural communities.', 'Hershey has developed a multifaceted approach that includes improving community and farmer awareness.', 'We also invest in preventive, supplier-led approaches that monitor farmers to check that child labor is not occurring and providing resources and oversight to help remediate instances of child labor if they are found.', 'Identifying and Addressing Child Labor Our regular review of key risks in the cocoa supply chain (as outlined in our cocoa due diligence process on page 23) continues to highlight the importance of monitoring, preventing and remediating instances of child labor.', 'CLMRS, championed by the ICI and proven to be an effective measure in helping to protect against child labor, is the leading method of child labor detection and remediation among children aged 5–17 years old.', 'It is implemented by supply chain partners and community-based groups that identify child labor and monitor and help remediate when cases are found.', 'Supply chain partners are responsible for collecting and reporting on this data.', 'Hershey began implementing industry aligned best practice CLMRS executed by supply chain and community partners in 2018.', 'Supply chain and community partners identify potential child labor situations and investigate, monitor and remediate when cases are found.', 'For Hershey, “remediated” means that through our supply chain partners a child has received mitigation efforts appropriate to their situation, such as being enrolled in school.', 'As a result, the child no longer participates in activities defined as child labor and is no longer at risk of being enlisted to undertake these activities.', 'Due to case-by-case differences between child labor situations, remediation can be done at the child, household or community level.', 'Remediation responsiveness, therefore, can range from almost instant (e.g., household awareness training that is conducted when data is collected and/or cases found) to 6–18 months (e.g., renovation of classrooms or school canteens to get kids back to school).', 'Children identified as victims of child labor receive two or three follow-up visits over several months to establish whether they are out of child labor.', 'Continued monitoring then reveals whether those children stay out of child labor consistently or are identified once more engaging in potentially hazardous activities.', 'Working to Eliminate Child Labor What Is Child Labor?', 'Hershey uses the International Labour Organization (ILO) definition: Child labor is work that is mentally, physically, socially or morally dangerous and harmful to children and/or interferes with their schooling.', 'Not all work performed by children, such as helping their parents around the home and assisting in a family business, is classified as child labor.', 'Such activities are sometimes referred to as “light work.” The worst forms of child labor put children at the greatest risk and are the highest priority for elimination.', 'Most instances of inappropriate child labor involve tasks such as carrying heavy loads like firewood or water, contact with agrochemicals or clearing of land with sharp tools.', 'Child labor is distinct from forced labor, which is defined by the ILO as: Situations in which persons are coerced to work through the use of violence or intimidation, or by more subtle means such as accumulated debt, retention of identity papers or threats of denunciation to immigration authorities.', 'Hershey is a member of ICI’s Forced Labor Sub-Group, working with our peers and technical experts to advance knowledge, skills, and action on preventing, monitoring, identifying and addressing forced labor in cocoa supply chains.', '24 The Hershey Company | 2021 ESG Report The Big Picture Our Company Cocoa Responsible Sourcing and Human Rights Environment Our

activity is identified and information about his/her situation is recorded in a centralized database The report is verified Children and their families receive remediation support from supply chain facilitators and NGO partners or are referred to public services, an approach that is aligned with practices recommended by the ILO The data is used to design actions in support of children identified We also support the establishment of community-level child protection committees.', 'Composed of trusted community members, these groups are in the best position to raise awareness, identify cases of child labor and implement the most appropriate practices to remediate those cases.', 'Depending on the type of child labor detected, remediation support is conducted at the child, household or community level.', 'Successful child labor remediation strategies vary and need to respond to the needs of individual children and their families.', 'They may also be dependent upon the presence of government social welfare agencies to which cases can be referred for additional follow-up by local authorities.', 'By increasing farmers’ awareness of what constitutes child labor (such as children carrying heavy loads and being exposed to farm pesticides) and improving farmers’ and families’ ease and efficiency of completing tasks around the farm, children are less likely to participate in dangerous farm tasks.', 'What’s Next We will continue to invest funds to improve the quality of CLMRS and to expand it with the aim of ensuring that no child is overlooked, and everyone receives the support they need.', 'Our CLMRS covered 62% of Hershey cocoa volumes, on the way to achieving our goal of 100% by 2025.', 'As of 2021, Hershey’s CLMRS found no evidence of forced child labor in our programs in Côte d’Ivoire and Ghana.', 'Almost 2,000 children were either remediated or have aged out of the CLMRS.', 'To see our key performance metrics from the year, see page 31.', '62% of Hershey

able to attend school and by encouraging school attendance through our school feeding initiative.', 'We focus significant resources and effort on making it easier for children to access and continue their education, such as by improving education infrastructure, training school-parent management committees, providing school kits filled with important school supplies, distributing vitamin-fortified, peanut-based, ready-to-use therapeutic food to schoolchildren and helping children and youth obtain birth certificates for school enrollment.', 'In October 2021, we signed a five-year agreement with the Jacobs Foundation, the Government of Côte d’Ivoire Ministry of Education and Literacy, and 14 other chocolate producers and cocoa suppliers to implement the Child Learning and Education Facility (CLEF).', 'This new public-private initiative will contribute to improved foundational literacy and numeracy skills for five million children at primary school level and includes an investment in 2,500 new classrooms.', 'Addressing Child Labor Through School-Based Nutrition Not only does a full stomach improve a student’s ability to concentrate and learn, it can also be the deciding factor between whether or not a child attends school.', 'In collaboration with Ghana’s Ministry of Gender, Children and Social Protection, the Ghana National School Feeding Programme and our suppliers, Hershey has been distributing ViVi daily to school children in cocoa-growing communities in Ghana since 2015.', 'ViVi, developed by Hershey and our partner Project Peanut Butter, provides children with 30% of their daily nutritional intake requirements.', 'In 2021, we reached approximately 25,000 children daily in Ghana.', 'In addition, ViVi is produced in Ghana in a factory that employs 30 local men and women and provides a secure market for more than 20 Ghanaian peanut farmers.', 'In February 2021, production and distribution began in Côte d’Ivoire, thanks to a partnership with the country’s National Nutrition Council and a new Hershey-funded ViVi factory at San Pedro, in southwestern Côte d’Ivoire.', 'The trial distribution reached 2,552 students.', 'By September 2021, distribution expanded to reach 20,000 school children daily in the regions of San Pedro and Haut-Sassandra.', 'We expect further growth of the project in Côte d’Ivoire in 2022.', 'Knowing that children will be fed at school is another reason to ensure they go to class rather than to work, making it an important preventive tool in the fight against child labor.1 Research

negotiating power for farmers to set crop prices, a singular reliance on cocoa for income, falling cocoa yields as cocoa trees age, illiteracy, a lack of proper business and financial training and persistently disempowered women.', 'Additionally, we know that the cycle of poverty continues to exacerbate the existence of child labor and deforestation in these communities.', 'Our aim is to support cocoa farmers’ transition out of poverty, and we support development of multiple opportunities to increase income and build resilience.', 'Supporting the Development of Farmer Groups Farmer groups are essential platforms for farmers to unify their voices to increase their earning potential and economic resilience.', 'In 2021, through Cocoa For Good, Hershey expanded its support to 102 farmer groups, reaching more than 94,300 farmers through our suppliers across seven origins.', 'Our support has assisted these farmer groups and farmers in receiving independent verification of their cocoa in compliance with credible sustainability standards.', 'This action not only helped us reach our goal of sourcing 100% independently verified cocoa but also ensures the farmer groups and farmers are paid a higher premium for their harvests.', 'Farmers receive direct cash payouts from the certification premium, which enables them to reinvest in their farms and their families.', 'At the group level, the certification premium is used to further strengthen the resiliency of the group as a whole through investment in shared equipment and capacity building, like training on climate-smart cocoa techniques and income- diversification opportunities.', 'Improving Income Through Farm Development Plans We support farmers in achieving economic gains by actively exploring how to improve their farming practices through creation of tailored farm development plans.', 'Through Cocoa For Good and associated farmer groups, farmers have access to higher-yielding cocoa varieties and are trained on the proper pruning of shade and cocoa trees, fertilization and irrigation, and weed and disease control.', 'Farmer group members also have improved access to credit and loans to make further investments in their farms.', 'In 2021, this support included more than 31,000 farm development plans.', 'Supporting Income Diversification To help diversify economic opportunities, we support cocoa community members in developing alternative means of generating income.', 'In 2021, more than 2,600 community members were trained in alternative income- generating opportunities, such as soap making and cassava processing.', 'Lifting up Rural Livelihoods 27 The Hershey Company | 2021 ESG Report The Big Picture Our Company Cocoa Responsible Sourcing and Human Rights Environment Our People Youth

women — and communities learn about saving, borrowing and investing responsibly.', 'The groups’ members are likely to be either completely unbanked or unable to qualify for a loan through traditional financial providers.', 'In VSLAs, loans are based on trust among group members.', 'The groups also create a small solidarity fund that is dispensed either for collective problems (such as repairing a village water pump) or individual emergencies.', 'Hershey now directly supports nearly 200 VSLAs with 5,879 members, 79% of whom are women.', 'Thanks to collective savings, the VSLAs provided an invaluable source of funds to boost financial resilience and security during the pandemic.', 'Empowering Youth To break the intergenerational cycle of poverty, today’s youth in cocoa communities (defined as 15- to 35-year-olds) need to be equipped with life skills, technical and vocational skills and the practical knowledge and tools needed to become self-sufficient community leaders of the future.', 'We support youth economic empowerment through access to vocational training, land tenure documents and the development of income-earning opportunities such as community pruning teams.', 'Pruning teams are groups of up to 10 young adults who help provide essential pruning services to cocoa farmers in their communities.', 'Regular pruning of cocoa trees helps to prevent tree mold and diseases and reduces the need for farmers to apply agrochemicals and pesticides.', 'In addition to providing an invaluable service to farmers, in 2021, these community pruning teams provided 372 young adults (39 of them women) in cocoa-growing communities with valuable skills and knowledge about cocoa farming, while also helping to support their families with extra income.', 'Continuing Our Work to Understand and Promote Farmer Incomes In 2021, we published our Living Wage & Income Position Statement and began taking additional steps to understand the gaps between farmers’ current income and a living income.', 'Working with the research firm Ipsos, we implemented a new biannual impact assessment methodology to capture data on farmer and household income.', 'This research will allow us to measure the efficacy of our programs in addressing farmer livelihoods, including improving income.', 'In conducting our research, we use benchmarks endorsed by the Living Income Community of Practice (LICOP), which defines living income as: “The net annual income required for a household in a particular place to afford a decent standard of living for all members of that household.” Collection of baseline data was completed in late 2021 for Côte d’Ivoire and will finish in Ghana in early 2022.', 'Initial results suggest that while only a small percentage of cocoa farming households earn a household income above the Living Income Benchmark, the majority are above the national poverty line in Côte d’Ivoire.', 'Further analysis will be focused on better understanding how the Cocoa For Good program can support farmer livelihoods to increase the percentage of households above the Living Income threshold.', 'For our key performance metrics from the year, see page 31.', '28 The Hershey

Africa, deforestation and biodiversity loss are a manifestation of a complex set of root causes including poverty, the absence of land titles, a lack of clarity on land tenure arrangements, limited knowledge of good agricultural practices and resource-challenged law enforcement agencies.', 'To stop deforestation in our supply chain, Hershey is investing in helping farmers secure land titles where they farm, spreading climate- positive farming methods and investing in protecting the uniquely rich ecosystems where cocoa is produced in Côte d’Ivoire and Ghana.', 'Since 2018, Hershey has publicly committed to no new deforestation in our global cocoa supply chain and to implementing shade-grown cocoa with agroforestry tree-planting programs.', 'In 2021, Hershey supported the nationwide “1 Day, 50 Million Trees” reforestation campaign led by the Ministry of Water Resources and Forests in Côte d’Ivoire.', 'Farm Locations and Deforestation Throughout the past few years we funded comprehensive mapping of cocoa farms in Côte d’Ivoire and Ghana where our suppliers source the cocoa volume used in Hershey products.', 'The mapping provides a baseline deforestation rate through measuring annual tree cover loss and closely monitoring farm locations for encroachment into protected forest areas.', 'Securing Land Titles to Unlock Land Value Without proper land titles, it is difficult for farmers to access financing or make necessary changes on their farms to prevent deforestation, promote reforestation and apply agroforestry and climate-smart cocoa farming.', 'Through our partnership with the USAID Integrated Land and Resource Governance (ILRG) Project, we support communities in Ghana to clarify and document land rights as well as improve land-use planning practices through agroforestry.', 'In 2021, our engagement with ILRG and one of our suppliers, ECOM, assisted 1,244 farmers in acquiring land title documentation.', 'In 2020, we co-launched with the German Agency for International Cooperation (GIZ), the Government of Côte d’Ivoire and other partners the Côte d’Ivoire Land Partnership program (CLAP) to promote affordable land titling as a catalyst for halting deforestation.', 'Due to our intervention and design of relevant land tenure documents that are government sanctioned and community accepted, this partnership was able to shorten the time of delivery and costs of securing land titles, greatly improving farmers’ access.', 'In addition, in Zégo, a town in Côte d’Ivoire’s Lôh-Djiboua region, CLAP provided members of the village land management committee with technical training on the use of GPS devices to record land rights, with a special focus on land- use contracts with tenants.', 'Benefiting from fit-for-purpose technology, community members can now record land rights locally and formalize owner-tenant agreements, something previously cost-prohibitive for these communities.', 'Continuing Our Landscape Programs We continued our Kakum Agroforestry Landscape Program partnership in Ghana, which covers an area equivalent to 20 times the size of Manhattan and includes the Kakum National Park, an intact tropical rainforest covering 145 square miles (375 square kilometers) that is home to antelopes, elephants, monkeys and a number of other endangered wildlife species.', 'This partnership promotes and supports community-led landscape management, spreads climate-smart cocoa- growing practices and provides training for extra income-generating activities.', 'Fighting Deforestation 29 The Hershey Company | 2021 ESG Report The Big Picture Our Company Cocoa Responsible Sourcing and Human Rights Environment Our People Youth Community About This Report Cocoa', 'Promoting Cocoa Agroforestry in Ghana The Kakum Cocoa Agroforestry Landscape Project engages the chocolate and cocoa sector companies along with the Ghana Cocoa Board, Ghana Forestry Commission and the Nature Conservation Research Centre.', 'The project fosters sustainability at a landscape scale — both on farms and across the surrounding expanse of cocoa and forest lands — in the environment surrounding world-renowned Kakum National Park, in Ghana’s Central Region.', 'The initiative supports the development of an innovative community-based landscape governance system to improve natural resource management, reduce deforestation and enhance forest protection.', 'At the same time, it aims to expand cocoa agroforestry practices and income diversification through emerging botanical supply chains.', 'So far, the project has developed management plans covering nearly 40,000 hectares of cocoa, food crop and forest- fallow lands in more than 80 communities that border the Kakum National Park.', 'In addition, the project is implementing cocoa agroforestry activities and climate-smart interventions that benefit thousands of cocoa farmers and their communities.', 'This includes planting more than 30,000 multi- purpose shade tree seedlings since 2018.', 'Many farmers in these communities have also benefited from income diversification through harvesting and selling kombo nuts.', 'Over the long term, the project will transform the Kakum cocoa-forest landscape toward a more sustainable agroforestry system, in which forests are protected, cocoa farmers and their families experience improved well-being and empowerment, and socio- economic and ecological resilience to climate change across the landscape is strengthened.', 'Promoting Climate-Smart Cocoa As we help more farmers to gain control of their land, we are also promoting climate-smart growing techniques.', 'In 2021, 41% of Cocoa For Good farmers in Côte d’Ivoire and Ghana were trained on climate-smart cocoa using a curriculum Hershey helped develop.', 'We anticipate expanding access to this training by making the content available via a free app.', 'Cocoa For Good farmers worked on 219,321 hectares of cocoa area across seven origins in line with sustainable farming practice, including promoting shade grown agroforestry, specific tree species, tree handling and planting and the management of trees after planting.', 'Find out more about our progress against public targets in Hershey’s dedicated CFI reports.', 'What’s Next We will continue our engagement in our current landscape initiative and are exploring new landscape

environmental and social risks known in our ingredients and raw materials supply chains alongside spend data to identify priority supply chains for responsible sourcing due diligence, investment and programming.', 'We identified five priorities: cocoa, dairy, sugar, palm oil, and pulp and paper.', 'This prioritization helps us target where we can make the biggest impact while reducing risks in our supply chain.', 'After achieving many of our 2020 responsible sourcing ingredient commitments, in 2021, we established new and ambitious goals and strategies across our priority ingredients and materials.', 'Our responsible sourcing commitments account for social and environmental challenges faced in the communities and ecosystems where our priority ingredients and materials come from.', 'While working with suppliers and farmers to address these issues, we implement a variety of tools and approaches including: • Traceability1: improving visibility within our ingredient and raw material supply chains back to origin to understand opportunities for impact.', '• Supplier engagement, monitoring and verification: communicating our expectations to suppliers and strengthening their sustainability management while using third-party certification and verification schemes to monitor performance and drive continuous improvement across sustainability impact areas.', '• Origin-level and transformation investments: investing in Hershey, supplier and other partner-led origin-level programs focused on environmental, social and economic issues.', '• Industry engagement: participating in industry-wide partnerships to enable systemic change, as companies cannot solve these complex sustainability challenges alone.', 'In 2022, we will refresh our priority ingredients risk assessment to account for 1) changes in our supply chain, including the acquisitions of Lily’s, Dot’s and Pretzels; 2) developments in our human rights and environmental strategies, such as the intersection with nature and water; and 3) changes in sustainability risks.', 'For a summary of our goals and KPIs related to responsible sourcing, see page 43.', '1 Traceability is not a chain of custody concept and

improvement and issues to monitor.', 'Hershey continues to partner with our supplier, American Sugar Refining (ASR), to implement the “Learn to Grow” programs in Belize and Mexico that deploy a farmer field school model to help farmers learn about and implement more sustainable growing practices.', 'These programs aim to holistically address environmental and social issues facing the farmers enrolled, including by supporting the development of a standard labor contract between the participating cane cutters and cane farmer associations that provide cane to mills that supply to Hershey via ASR.', 'In 2021, our program in Belize initiated a new phase to help farmers adapt to climate change through the use of technology that enables them to predict changing weather and pest patterns.',

Energy Efficiency Increasing the energy efficiency of our facilities is an important part of our work to tackle emissions and supports our mission as an ENERGY STAR partner.', 'In 2021, we launched a companywide energy program and joined the ENERGY STAR Challenge for Industry, which tasks companies with reducing energy intensity by 10% within five years.', 'To drive this commitment, each Hershey manufacturing location around the world has a designated energy champion who is responsible for implementing carbon savings projects, meeting conservation goals, identifying opportunities for energy reduction and efficiency, and engaging employees in these efforts.', 'The Hershey manufacturing facility in São Roque, Brazil, achieved the ENERGY STAR Challenge for Industry goal in just one year.', 'The facility reduced their energy consumption by completing projects and executing strategies to improve their on-site energy efficiency.', 'In addition, we joined the U.S. Department of Energy’s Better Buildings, Better Plants Program in 2021 to reduce energy intensity throughout our U.S. manufacturing operations by 20% within 10 years.', 'Through this program, we are accessing and leveraging additional energy management tools to further uncover energy saving opportunities.', 'Expanding Impact We’re not just looking for more ways to increase Hershey’s energy efficiency — our employees are replicating our efforts in their own homes.', 'In 2021, our Malaysia Green team held a three-month competition to reduce their household electricity bills.', 'The competition sparked action by recognizing and rewarding the best in energy conservation.', 'Monthly electricity-saving tips were shared with employees to encourage them to do their part in responsible electricity consumption for a

identified for more than 50% of PVC, with conversions underway.', 'The balance of Hershey’s PVC is on track to have qualified alternatives identified by the end of 2022.', 'We are driving our recyclable plan by finding materials that reduce our reliance on mixed- plastic materials that are not recyclable and are actively qualifying single-material alternatives that are more easily recyclable.', 'Within this space, we expect to begin conversion on some items in the U.S. as early as 2022.', 'In addition to recyclable plastics, we are exploring paper and compostable alternatives across several regions, including the U.S., Mexico, Brazil and Asia.', 'Beyond these efforts, we continue to drive circularity by increasing our use of recycled materials across our portfolio.', 'One example is the transition to 100% recycled material for corrugate cases by our Reese’s and Monterrey facilities.', 'This effort alone has saved almost 625,000 hours of energy, over 14,000 trees and almost two million gallons of water.', 'It also reduced GHG emissions by over 12 million pounds.', 'Lastly, we continue our long-standing commitment to reducing packaging waste to landfill by eliminating unnecessary packaging.', 'In 2021 alone, we eliminated 9.5 million pounds of material through packaging elimination, redesign and downgauging.', 'Our focus extends beyond just the consumer package to include secondary, transport and display packaging where we are investing in design solutions that drive distribution efficiencies to eliminate extra trucks on the road to minimize associated GHG emissions.', 'Exploring sustainable packaging requires a holistic approach that balances safety, quality, consumer needs, and manufacturing and distribution requirements.', 'Our priority is to make sure Hershey packaging continues to deliver high-quality and safe, consumable products to market.', 'For a summary of our goals and KPIs related to packaging, see page 60.',

we also plan to identify ways to improve Hershey’s green water use, which is the majority of our water footprint.', 'In 2021, we launched a preliminary assessment following the SBTN methodology.', 'This enabled us to better understand our water footprint and begin to gather insights on contextual water challenges across our operations and the value chain.', 'Our initial water risk and opportunities assessment included core commodities that account for the majority of ingredients, relevant materials and manufacturing plants.', 'We identified two material issues: reliance on water for agricultural products in the value chain (high risk) and water used for manufacturing (medium risk).', 'Following the assessment, we used the water footprint concept from the Water Footprint Network to compile information on water use.', 'This analysis revealed that nearly 100% of Hershey’s global water footprint takes place upstream in agriculture and packaging.', 'Furthermore, from the more than 30 countries where Hershey sources ingredients, 13 account for 96% of the company’s water footprint.', 'Based on our water stress areas sourcing assessment, approximately 12% of our food ingredients in 2021 were sourced from regions with High or Extremely High Baseline Water Stress.1 Using leading global water screening tools — including Aqueduct from the World Resources Institute — we began to identify priority areas to create more sustainable water systems and help future-proof growth against climate change.', 'While the SBTN pilot methodology only requires the use of two indicators in the Aqueduct tool, we chose to review all 13 indicators of physical water quantity and quality risks and safe drinking water supplies.', 'We also took preliminary steps to research some of the social impacts of water issues, including exploring how our water footprint could be linked to impacts associated with access to clean water and sanitation and where vulnerabilities might exist.', 'For a summary of our goals and KPIs on managing our water, see page 61.', 'Operational Water Footprint By Factory2 Water Intensity (L/Kg of product produced) Low Low High High Water

information with employees on topics such as travel and health and safety requirements.', 'Employees that were able to work from home continued to do so.', 'We also kept our facilities safe for

surges in infections.', 'The majority of cases we recorded have been traced back to contacts occurring outside of work.', 'We believe this is a testament to the efficacy of the systems our teams put in place and the deep care and concern Hershey employees showed for their peers.', 'Despite the ongoing challenges presented by the pandemic, we were able to develop a new Environmental, Health and Safety (EHS) Management System modeled on the leading ISO 14001 and 45001 standards.', 'We believe that standardizing practices not only makes it easier to ensure legal compliance regardless of location but also unites our people under one way of thinking about EHS.', 'Our approach is based on global best practices and seeks to meet or exceed regulations wherever we operate.', 'The new standardization practices will include developing updated global safety standards for both people and the environment and providing regular training for relevant employees on applicable topics.', 'The new Management System will be fully implemented by 2022.', 'Its implementation will be supported by a robust internal audit system that will validate the application of the standard as well as sites’ compliance with local regulations.', 'The Audit teams will consist of EHS Center of Excellence members and EHS managers from other sites.', 'Our EHS Lean Pillar team will be overseeing the implementation of the new safety standards and procedures.', 'While standardizing safety processes, we also developed a training matrix that lists all safety topics, the frequency of training required, the relevant personnel to be trained or to manage training and what resources the training requires, such as online classes or in-person demonstrations.', 'Meeting New EHS Goals We are already on track to meet our newly launched goal of 50% hazard reduction for job functions with ergonomic risks.', 'To get there, we have been implementing a culture-based ergonomics program across

scaled up our work to improve scheduling for manufacturing teams and retail employees while migrating to a more virtual workplace for corporate employees.', 'We also adapted our benefits to find more ways to recognize the added workload of caring for families during working hours.', 'For example, our Bundle Program is an “Educare” virtual platform designed to give employees a break from childcare

updated in 2021 to expand data scope to employees on long-term leave (over 30 calendar days).', '2020 data restated accordingly.', 'PMI’s Statement of Purpose While Philip Morris International Inc. (“PMI” or the “Company”) is widely known as a cigarette company, in 2016 it announced its new purpose: to deliver a smoke-free future by focusing its resources on developing, scientifically substantiating, and responsibly commercializing smoke-free products that are less harmful than smoking, with the aim of completely replacing cigarettes as soon as possible.', 'These innovative alternative products do not burn tobacco or create smoke, and therefore emit significantly lower levels of carcinogens and other toxic substances than cigarettes.', 'Building on the Board’s Letter to Shareholders and the first Statement of Purpose in PMI’s 2017 and 2020 Proxy Statements respectively, we reaffirm PMI’s purpose and acknowledge that, as the Company continues to transform its business and organization, its core effort to provide smoke-free alternatives that appeal to today’s adult smokers— and to work hard to convince them to switch—will not be enough.', 'The Company needs to continue earning the trust and active cooperation of a host of stakeholders, from supply chain partners to regulators and public health authorities.', 'A smoke-free future is attainable, and the benefits it can bring to the people who would otherwise continue to smoke, and hence to global public health, are enormous.', 'However, the Company cannot succeed alone.', 'Together with governments and civil society, we can maximize this opportunity through a consensus that smoke-free alternatives, when subject to proper government oversight and regulation, are part of a sound tobacco policy.', 'Smoking causes serious disease, and the best way to avoid the harms of smoking is never to start or, for those who smoke, to quit.', 'For decades, tobacco control has focused on strict fiscal, marketing, and other measures to deter initiation and to encourage cessation.', 'These must be continued.', 'Nevertheless, while smoking prevalence rates continue to slowly decline, the World Health Organization projects that the estimated number of 1.1 billion people who smoke tobacco products today will remain largely unchanged by 2025, reflecting population growth.1 Nicotine, while addictive and not risk-free, is not the primary cause of smoking-related disease.', 'The primary cause is the harmful chemicals emitted while burning tobacco and contained in the smoke.', 'Eliminating combustion from nicotine-containing products is the way to significantly reduce their toxicity.', 'Thanks to rapid advances in science and technology, and a strong PMI commitment, these products are now a reality.', 'In 2016, with the full support of the Board of Directors, the Company announced its new purpose of delivering a smoke-free future.', 'Since then, the Company has fully aligned its employees with this purpose and swiftly shifted its organizational focus and resources to smoke- free alternatives.', 'The Company is essentially disrupting its traditional business from the inside out and is leading the industry in this unprecedented transformation.', 'PMI’s smoke-free product portfolio currently includes heat-not-burn products, nicotine-containing vapor products, and oral nicotine products, all without combustion.', 'Their development and manufacturing follow high standards of quality and consistency.', 'The Company is committed to scientifically substantiating the harm reduction potential of its smoke-free alternatives compared to cigarette smoking, including through rigorous preclinical and clinical assessments and sophisticated systems toxicology.', 'Our scientific findings are publicly available and peer- reviewed, and we have submitted many of our findings to regulatory authorities, including the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.', 'The totality of the scientific evidence makes the Company confident that switching completely to smoke-free products is likely to present less risk of harm than continuing to smoke.', 'Post- market surveillance is necessary to continue building this confidence and, over time, quantify the reduction in morbidity and mortality through epidemiology.', 'To be clear, these smoke-free alternatives are not risk-free and should not be used by youth or adults who would not otherwise continue to smoke or use other nicotine products.', 'The Company must market its smoke-free alternatives responsibly to minimize any unintended use while maximizing the switching of adult smokers who would otherwise continue smoking.', '1 WHO Global Report on Trends in Prevalence of Tobacco Smoking 2015.', 'Philip Morris International – Integrated Report 2021 6 7 Overview Strategy Operational impact Product impact Fundamentals Reporting and performance', 'While cigarette sales today remain the largest part of PMI’s business in most countries, this is changing rapidly.', 'The Company is actively accelerating the decline of cigarette smoking beyond what traditional tobacco control measures can achieve alone.', 'To make its progress both measurable and verifiable, the Company developed a set of bespoke key performance indicators called Business Transformation Metrics.', 'This set of metrics and related goals, which PMI reports on periodically, allow stakeholders to assess both the pace and the scale of its transformation and showcase how it is allocating resources away from its traditional cigarette business, aiming to base success on a future where it no longer makes or sells cigarettes.', 'Although the Company’s transformation journey started with a vision centered on the critical mission of phasing out cigarettes, this is not its sole or ultimate end goal.', 'Researching and developing noncombustible alternatives that are scientifically substantiated to be less harmful than cigarettes was the first step.', 'Broadening access for adult smokers while simultaneously and deliberately working to phase out cigarette smoking completed the equation of its smoke-free purpose.', 'In the process, the Company has expanded its social, human, intellectual, and manufactured capital in ways that allow it to go a step further, moving from a value proposition centered on doing less harm toward one where it can seek to have a net positive impact on society.', 'PMI is now actively working to expand its purpose and evolve into a broader lifestyle, consumer wellness and healthcare company, extending its value proposition and innovative capability to commercialize products that go beyond tobacco and nicotine.', 'This is built on two key growth areas: (1) wellness products, where the Company is developing and looking to commercialize scientifically substantiated consumer health products and solutions with the aim to improve people’s lives (2) healthcare products, where it has already committed resources to its development pipeline of over-the-counter and prescription products.', 'This is part of a larger transformation that puts science, technology, and sustainability at the heart of PMI’s future by building on the Company’s expertise and investment in aerosol chemistry and physics, device technology, clinical research, and best-in- class preclinical safety and inhalation models.', 'Employees PMI’s ability to accomplish its purpose depends on the skills, dedication, and relentless efforts of its employees.', 'The Company’s focus on a smoke-free future and long-term opportunities in wellness and healthcare has enhanced its ability to attract the new talent needed to support its transformation.', 'The Company compensates its employees fairly and provides important benefits.', 'It supports them with enriching job experiences, training, and education to help them develop new skills and maximize their employability in a rapidly changing world.', 'The Company treats employees with respect, dignity, care, and fairness.', 'It fosters diversity, inclusion, equal opportunity, and equal salary policies to ensure PMI’s workforce reflects modern society.', 'Regulators Regulators can decisively accelerate the industry’s transformation toward, and the speed at which adult smokers switch to, smoke-free products by implementing risk-proportionate regulations and taxation for all nicotine-containing products and by providing smokers with accurate information.', 'PMI is committed to engaging transparently with regulators, sharing its scientific research and post-market data.', 'The Company is ready to support an industry-wide gradual phaseout of cigarettes as soon as a majority of smokers in a country have switched to scientifically substantiated smoke-free products.', 'PMI believes that with the right regulatory encouragement and support from civil society, cigarette sales can end within 10 to 15 years in many countries.', 'Public health community The public health community is, unfortunately, polarized on the issue of smoke-free products.', 'Without question, their work to discourage youth and nonsmokers from starting to use any tobacco or nicotine product and to encourage cessation should continue.', 'At the same time, when better alternatives to cigarettes exist, the discussion should not be whether they should be made available to the more than one billion people who smoke today, but how fast and within what regulatory framework to maximize their adoption while minimizing unintended use.', 'PMI’s key stakeholder constituencies, which are fundamental to both the achieving of its purpose and to the pace of its progress, will be affected in different ways by PMI’s transformation.', 'The Company will seek to engage and collaborate with relevant stakeholders to speed the transformation while mitigating negative consequences.', 'Consumers Adult smokers and adult nicotine users are at the core of PMI’s business transformation.', 'The public health benefit of smoke-free products depends not only on their potential to reduce the risk of smoking- related disease compared to continued smoking but also on if they are actually used as alternatives to cigarettes by as many adult smokers as possible.', 'For smokers to switch to them, these alternatives must be accessible.', 'Increasing accessibility means improving consumer awareness, acceptability, as well as the availability and affordability of our smoke-free products.', 'Acceptability means delivering experiences that satisfy the needs of adult smokers while significantly reducing the exposure to the harmful and potentially harmful constituents of cigarette smoke.', 'It is vital that we engage with adult smokers to raise awareness of smoke-free products and their benefits compared with cigarettes.', 'While PMI will continue to responsibly sell cigarettes as long as there is a significant legitimate demand, it will leverage its leading position to accelerate switching to better alternatives, continuing to focus its commercial efforts toward raising awareness of, and informing adult smokers in appropriate ways about, scientifically substantiated smoke-free products and the benefits of switching versus continued smoking.', 'The Company carefully monitors the results of its marketing to minimize any unintended use of its smoke-free products by nonsmokers, especially youth.', 'In addition, PMI’s new businesses will leverage its know-how and capabilities in areas such as inhalation and aerosolization to create better products to target unmet medical and consumer needs and deliver a better experience and enhanced products for consumers and patients.', 'The Company is urging this important stakeholder group to seize the immense opportunity that smoke-free products present for advancing public health within the current generation of smokers.', 'PMI asks the public health community to scrutinize its smoke-free products, to provide feedback for improvement, and to be open to considering that PMI’s purpose aligns with the societal goal to change the health trajectories of the people who smoke.', 'Supply chain People working in the Company’s supply chain around the world, including tobacco farmers, rely on PMI for a substantial portion of their income.', 'PMI deals fairly and ethically with its suppliers and is dedicated to acting as a good partner to other companies, large and small, that help us meet PMI’s mission.', 'PMI recognizes that smoke-free products differ from cigarettes and entail change for some of its supply chain partners, and PMI is ready to help them in this transition.', 'Civil society Continued engagement and partnerships with civil society remain essential to the Company’s success.', 'PMI respects the many communities and the environment around the world where it operates.', 'PMI works hard to protect society and the environment through sustainable practices across its businesses, and to both address and prevent future social and environmental challenges, including reducing post-consumer waste (focusing on eco-design and circularity), tackling climate change, preserving nature, improving the quality of life of people in our supply chain, and fostering an empowered and inclusive workplace.', 'The scope, metrics, and progress on these areas are outlined in PMI’s annual Integrated Report, published on PMI’s website.', 'Philip Morris International – Integrated Report 2021 8 9 Overview Strategy Operational impact Product impact Fundamentals Reporting and performance', 'Message from PMI’s Executive Chairman Shareholders The Company is confident in the core business growth prospects of smoke-free products and the significant additional long-term opportunity from innovating in wellness and healthcare.', 'It is leading the new, highly promising category of smoke-free products and leveraging its unique capabilities to capture further areas of growth.', 'PMI is dedicated to ensuring its shareholders continue to receive strong and sustainable financial returns over time.', 'It is aware of the growing tendency among some investors toward exclusion and negative screening but does not believe it is an effective driver of change that can have a positive impact, especially with regard to driving behavioral change in convincing people who smoke to quit or improve their lives.', 'On the contrary, by investing in PMI and holding the Company accountable to its purpose and targets, investors can combine positive societal impact with long-term financial returns.', 'The Company welcomes suggestions, pressure, and support through engagement with both current and potential investors.', 'The

responsibly and coherently sell cigarettes taking a consistent, disciplined, and steady approach to one day completely leaving them behind.', 'While contradictory on the surface, this is a necessary trade-off that is vital to expanding our leadership in smoke-free products and driving a successful industry transition.', 'We are convinced that impactful and systemic change can be best achieved by transforming from the inside out, engaging constructively with different parts of society, and ultimately replacing cigarettes with smoke-free products.', 'The relationship between the sources of tension will disappear over time, as our legitimate ambition to maintain market share in the declining combustible product category does not mean we aim to continue selling cigarettes in the long

publication of our first business transformation- linked financing framework in 2021, which integrates the company’s smoke-free transformation into its financing strategy.', 'Linking our most material sustainability priorities to part of our financing strategy strengthens our commitment and underscores to all our stakeholders the seriousness of our ambitions.', 'I believe this not only reinforces our promise to reinvent our company but also invites investors and lenders to engage with and support our relentless work to accelerate the end of smoking, continue to grow our smoke- free business, and use our strong capabilities to develop products in wellness and healthcare that can have a net positive impact on society.', 'The subsequent announcement of our company entering into an agreement for its first business transformation-linked financing instrument—a new revolving credit facility for an aggregate amount of USD 2.5 billion—was testament to the success of our integrated approach.',

heated tobacco and e-vapor products), and oral tobacco and nicotine products such as snus and nicotine pouches.', 'By eliminating combustion, these products present, or have the potential to present, less risk of harm to adults who switch to them versus continued smoking.', '• Therapeutic cigarette replacement alternatives, which include nicotine gum and patches, aim to help smokers quit

do not involve combustion, including pouches, e-cigarettes, and heated tobacco, extends back more than two decades.', 'These efforts were driven by a combination of increased awareness of the harms of smoking, evolving technologies, discoveries of different ways to deliver nicotine, and a better understanding of behaviors connected to smoking.', 'The reduced risk potential of these products, coupled with their availability and increased acceptability, is leading smokers to switch away from combustible tobacco products and never come back to smoking.', 'The potential of smoke-free products to contribute to reducing population harm and, eventually, benefit public health, has led to the introduction of progressive public health strategies based on the concept of tobacco harm reduction.',

'Regulation and taxation The harms associated with smoking have led policymakers, legislators, and regulators to impose rigorous restrictions on cigarettes, including high excise taxes, minimum age requirements, and designated areas for use.', 'Additional restrictions and mandates apply to packaging design and health warnings, ingredients and flavors, marketing and advertising, and promotions and other forms of sponsorship.', 'Much of the regulation that shapes the tobacco industry’s operating environment is driven by the WHO’s Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC) and its MPOWER measures.', 'The FCTC has established a global agenda to reduce the prevalence of tobacco use and nonsmokers’ exposure to tobacco smoke.', 'Our perspective at PMI Government regulation of all nicotine- containing products is essential.', 'PMI supports a comprehensive approach that discourages initiation and promotes cessation, supplemented by commonsense regulation that encourages adults who smoke and would not otherwise quit to switch completely to smoke-free alternatives that have been scientifically substantiated to be a better choice than continued smoking.', 'We advocate for a comprehensive and risk- proportionate regulatory framework that recognizes that not all tobacco- and nicotine- containing products are the same.', 'Regulation and taxation should subject the most harmful products to the most restrictive measures while encouraging those adults who would otherwise continue to smoke to switch to the less harmful alternatives now available.', 'Such an approach would significantly accelerate the phasing out of combustible products and promote public health.', 'Illicit trade prevention The increasingly interconnected global economy provides more opportunities for criminal networks engaged in illicit activities such as the sale of counterfeit products, wildlife smuggling, narcotics, human trafficking, and excise fraud.', 'The illicit tobacco trade provides a cheap and unregulated supply of tobacco products.', 'It undermines efforts to reduce smoking prevalence, damages legitimate businesses, stimulates organized crime, increases corruption, and reduces government tax revenue.', 'It is estimated that illicit trade accounts for as much as 10 to 12 percent of global cigarette consumption and that governments worldwide are losing USD 40 to 50 billion in tax revenues each year as a result.1 Many countries have initiated or are considering actions to prevent the illicit trade of tobacco products.', 'In 2012, the FCTC adopted the Protocol to Eliminate Illicit Trade in Tobacco Products, which includes supply chain control measures such as licensing, enforcement in free trade zones, and the implementation of tracking and tracing technologies.', 'The protocol came into force in September 2018, and parties to it have started implementing its measures via national legislation.', 'Our perspective at PMI For PMI, eliminating the illicit tobacco trade has been a long-standing priority.', 'We focus our efforts on securing our supply chain and protecting our products.', 'Read more about our approach and progress in 2021 here.', '1 U.S. Department of

smoking initiation and encouraging cessation.', 'With the introduction of smoke-free products and the recognition of their potential to accelerate the decline of smoking prevalence and contribute to public health, the need for an updated approach to tobacco regulation has become urgent.', 'While there is currently no global consensus on how best to regulate or tax smoke-free products, a growing number of authorities recognize that the risk profile of these products differs from cigarettes and so should be regulated differently in order to promote their adoption as a better alternative for

response to stakeholder feedback, we have significantly expanded the number of metrics to increase transparency and clarity about our progress.', 'We review them periodically to ensure we continue reporting on meaningful indicators.', 'In 2021, we evolved our reporting efforts to broaden access to smoke-free products worldwide, by introducing an indicator on the number of low- and middle- income markets where smoke- free products are available for sale, replacing our previous reporting on non-OECD markets.', 'Although year-on-year progress is important to monitor and disclose, sometimes the magnitude of the pace and scale of our progress is lost.', 'Because of that, we have introduced a baseline approach, whereby we can highlight to our stakeholders the sizable cumulative progress that we have made to date.', 'Pre- transformation (in 2015), our combustible product volume totaled 881 billion units, or 99.9 percent of our shipment volume ratio, and, since then it has

become a predominantly smoke- free company, generating more than 50 percent of our total net revenues from non-combustible products.', 'Within the same time horizon, we aspire to grow our annual smoke-free shipment volume to over 250 billion units, while simultaneously decreasing our combustible product shipment volume to below 550 billion units.', 'This means we aspire for smoke-free products to represent more than 30 percent of our total shipment volume by 2025, and for our combustible product shipment volume to decrease by around 40 percent by 2025 versus a 2015 baseline.', 'We also aim for our smoke-free products to be available for sale in 100 markets by 2025, with more than 50 percent of these being low- and middle-income markets, and for at least 40 million adults to switch to them and stop smoking.', 'Finally, we introduced in 2021 a new aspiration to generate at least USD 1 billion in annual net revenues from wellness and healthcare products by 2025.', 'Looking ahead In 2022, we plan to evaluate our published targets to ensure they remain ambitious, reasonable, and achievable, in the context of a dynamic and evolving smoke-free industry.', 'In particular, we

innovate and develop solutions that can contribute to solving some of society’s most pressing challenges.', 'This also represents an opportunity for growth and our strongest competitive advantage.', 'Priority topics In the below visual, those topics that require our urgent attention and prioritization are highlighted in the most brightly colored boxes.', 'These priority topics include all topics related to the Product Impact pillar: materials and product eco-design; post-consumer waste; product health impact; sales, marketing, and consumer communications; innovation in wellness and healthcare; responsible R&D; product reliability; and nicotine science.', 'Our priority topics pertaining to our Operational Impact pillar include climate; water; biodiversity; diversity and inclusion; socioeconomic well-being of tobacco-farming communities; human capital development; business integrity; respect for human rights; and sustainable supply chain management.', 'The biggest and most pressing negative externality our strategy aims to address is the health impacts of cigarette smoking.', 'This is the most important contribution we can make to public health and is the cornerstone of PMI’s purpose and business strategy.', 'Addressing this critical issue requires a three-part approach: 1.', 'Develop better alternatives to smoking Research, develop, and commercialize scientifically substantiated nicotine-containing products that are less harmful than cigarettes 2.', 'Accelerate smoking decline Provide broad access to adult smokers, who otherwise would not quit smoking, to ensure these products accelerate the decline of smoking prevalence 3.', 'Make cigarettes obsolete Purposefully work to ensure these products ultimately replace cigarettes, driving their obsolescence Philip Morris International – Integrated Report 2021 40 41 Overview Strategy Operational impact Product impact Fundamentals Reporting and performance', 'Despite its critical importance, achieving a smoke-free future is not our final horizon.', 'We are simultaneously exploring adjacent opportunities for growth in wellness and healthcare, leveraging the capabilities we have accrued and developed while transforming our business.', 'It is through these avenues of growth that we will achieve our ultimate goal: becoming a business that has a net positive impact on society and the environment.', 'Our comprehensive strategy also recognizes the need to address other ESG issues related to our products and business operations.', 'As we accelerate our transition from cigarettes to smoke-free products, we must also minimize any adverse effects of our products on the planet.', 'Our efforts in this area include striving to design our products in a way that optimizes the use of materials and improves circularity, as well as appropriately managing their end-of-life to minimize negative environmental impacts.', 'In parallel, we must responsibly manage the impacts of our company’s operations throughout the value chain.', 'From a social standpoint, this includes ensuring fair treatment and empowerment of our employees and improving the lives of people across our supply chain.', 'On the environmental front, this means tackling climate change and preserving natural ecosystems.', 'As a result, our approach to sustainability addresses our ESG priorities through eight impact-driven strategies.', 'Four of these strategies focus on the impacts derived from our products and the remaining four strategies focus on the impacts derived from our business operations.', 'Last, but not least, our strategy highlights the importance of governance- related topics, which cannot be overstated.', 'Our company’s policies, rules, and procedures define our ability to implement sound strategies that successfully address environmental and social issues.', 'Connectivity and trade-offs between ESG topics Sustainability challenges do not exist in a vacuum.', 'They are often linked, and their interdependencies—including the direction of causality and magnitude—must be considered as we craft appropriate strategies and develop programs to address our company’s impacts.', 'We seek solutions that are mutually reinforcing.', 'For instance, our approach to carbon compensation—supported by our portfolio of climate investments (read more here)—favors nature-based solutions in our supply chain that remove carbon by restoring and enhancing plants and the ecosystem while also providing benefits in the areas of biodiversity, water, and social impact.', 'In other instances, addressing a particular topic may limit how we tackle another.', 'For example, the core of our smoke-free strategy is to raise awareness of smoke-free products among adult smokers and broaden access to them.', 'In doing so, however, it is critical that we limit our initiatives to minimize the risk that our messages will reach unintended audiences—namely, nonsmokers and youth.', 'Necessary trade-offs such as this often occur in the course of our business transformation.', 'For instance, the manufacturing processes of smoke-free consumables are more resource- intensive than for cigarettes—a circumstance that runs counter to our energy and water conservation efforts in our direct operations.', 'We are tackling this challenge and improving operational efficiency to mitigate and reverse this impact (read more here).', 'As another example, the growth of our smoke-free business will result in a simultaneous decline of our cigarette business.', 'While this consequence is fully intended, it also necessarily translates into a gradual decrease in demand for tobacco leaf, which will have an undeniable impact on our contracted farmers.', 'We seek to minimize the negative effects by improving the socioeconomic well- being and resilience of tobacco-farming communities (read more here).', 'Given the multifaceted and complex nature of sustainable development, trade-offs are inherent to decision-making.', 'In some circumstances, we are compelled to make sacrifices in one sustainability area to obtain benefits in another, at least for a period.', 'In designing our strategies and programs, it is vital that we accurately analyze, comprehend, and account for situations of forced compromise, guided by our sustainability materiality assessment.', 'Incorporating three lenses (stakeholder perspectives, outward impacts, and inward impacts), our sustainability materiality assessment serves as a compass with which to calibrate and prioritize competing ESG issues.', 'When appropriately addressed, some trade-offs can be a source of innovation, as such compromises press us to come up with novel ways to address the tensions that are present.', 'By embedding an integrated approach to sustainability within our business, we are able to monitor and tackle multiple issues simultaneously, identifying effective solutions that leverage interdependencies to make progress.', 'Philip Morris International – Integrated Report 2021 42 43 Overview Strategy Operational impact Product impact Fundamentals Reporting and performance', 'Our 2025 Roadmap Our roadmap outlines our key goals and informs the route of our company’s long-term plan.', 'PMI’s revised 2025 Roadmap comprises 11 headline goals, running to the end of 2025, connected to

link each of our eight priority areas of action to the SDG(s) to which it aligns.', 'We identified the SDGs on which we believe we can have a real and lasting impact (read more about our SDG mapping in our 2021 Sustainability Materiality Report).', 'Our SDG Index maps the actions and ambitions described throughout this report with the relevant SDGs and their respective targets.', 'PMI Sustainability Index Progress on our roadmap is measured with a set of key performance indicators that collectively form our Sustainability Index.', 'During 2021, we developed PMI’s Sustainability Index to measure and communicate progress against our aspirations in a rigorous and quantitative manner, using a set of clearly defined and verifiable metrics.', 'To better align with shareholder and other stakeholder interests, the introduction of this index has allowed the Compensation and Leadership Development Committee of PMI’s Board of Directors to enhance the company’s compensation practices, explicitly linking them to sustainability and further ensuring a strong link between executive compensation and ESG performance (read more here).', 'PMI’s Sustainability Index comprises 19 KPIs that are directly linked to our 11 roadmap goals.', 'As with our roadmap, we have split the 19 KPIs according to two drivers: “Product Sustainability” (11 KPIs) and “Operational Sustainability” (8 KPIs).', 'To form the Sustainability Index, we sought KPIs that were: • Well defined, allowing for accurate, reliable, and consistent measurement of progress over time • Meaningful, enabling stakeholders to assess our company’s progress towards its priority sustainability topics This required us to revise certain KPIs included in our former sustainability disclosures.', 'Further, applying these criteria led us to introduce new, more relevant indicators for inclusion in the index.', 'We have defined annual targets and performance ranges from 2022 to 2025 for each KPI in our Sustainability Index.', 'On an annual basis, using these predefined target ranges, we will assess and award a score to each KPI.', 'Thereafter, using a weight assigned to each KPI, the total Sustainability Index score will be calculated on a scale from 0 to 150 percent, with a target between 90 and 110 percent every year.', 'The weighting applied to each KPI is informed by the results of our sustainability materiality assessment.', 'Specifically, we attributed the highest weight to the social impacts of our products, where we believe our company can have the greatest impact.', 'Looking ahead During 2022, we intend to develop a new 2025 aspiration related to the total number of users of PMI smoke-free products.', 'Given the dynamic and evolving smoke-free industry, coupled with the potential impact of the Russian invasion of Ukraine (discussed on page 3 of this report) and its potential effects on our business over the mid to long term, which remain uncertain, we are working to refine this ambition and intend to communicate it within the next year.', 'To better reflect our priorities, as defined by our materiality analysis, we also intend to introduce two new KPIs to the index, incorporating the increasing relevance of water and biodiversity.', 'Setting ambitions and targets Progress requires clearly articulated targets and accountability for meeting them.', 'Measuring and reporting on progress is a backward- looking exercise.', 'To evaluate the effectiveness of our approach to sustainability and give clarity to both internal and external stakeholders, setting clear targets is paramount.', 'It allows us to define our direction, align on definitions and measurements of success, and hold ourselves accountable for progress.', 'When we introduced our 2025 Roadmap in our first Integrated Report (2019), we did not yet have clarity on precisely how we would achieve these ambitions.', 'Our recent materiality assessment and revamped ESG framework, together with the lessons learned from years of program implementation, prompted us in 2021 to cast a critical eye on our current aspirations and targets.', 'As a result, we reassessed and redefined our roadmap.', 'The intention was twofold: First, we wanted to ensure our roadmap was comprehensive, coherent, and consistent with our new strategy (based on our sustainability materiality results and ESG framework); and second, we wanted to evolve our approach to target-setting and ensure our goals are connected to impact, not merely to strategic inputs.', 'In some cases, this has led us to restate our goals to ensure that they are meaningful and viable, while remaining ambitious.', 'The result is a revamped 2025 Roadmap.', 'While most goals are not new, they are formulated more clearly.', 'Our roadmap now consists of 11 critical objectives connected to our eight strategies.', 'This revamped guide offers straightforward direction to our stakeholders by clearly outlining the social and environmental impacts we aim to achieve with both our products and our business operations.', 'To link each goal to specific outcomes and impacts, we developed a set of KPIs that precisely articulate how to measure progress and define success.', 'These 19 KPIs constitute our Sustainability Index.', 'Covering the full spectrum of our sustainability priorities, the index will allow PMI and our stakeholders to track the company’s progress toward its goals year-over-year.', 'In parallel, to increase the robustness of our nonfinancial performance data and disclosures, we developed a consolidated set of nonfinancial standards: PMI’s ESG KPI Protocol.', 'The Protocol includes the definition, methodology, and scope of each of our main ESG KPIs to ensure measurable, verifiable,

prevention, quitting campaigns, and cessation services, with a particular focus on vulnerable populations • Measures to address adult smokers’ confusion about the role of combustion and nicotine in the development of smoking-related disease • Regulatory and fiscal differentiation between combustible products and non-combusted forms of tobacco and nicotine, coupled with robust safeguards against unintended use • Post-market monitoring and surveillance to assess public health outcomes and the impact of policy interventions • Phase-out policies to help permanently end smoked tobacco sales • Post-phase-out support for adult smokers who still continue smoking • Robust anti-illicit trade policies Appropriate regulation and taxation to drive cigarette obsolescence Regulation of all nicotine-containing products (including both combustible and smoke-free) is essential.', 'We advocate for a comprehensive and risk-proportionate regulatory framework that acknowledges that not all

combustion, we can significantly reduce or eliminate the formation of harmful and potentially harmful constituents (HPHCs).', '• Reduction in emissions of harmful and potentially harmful constituents: We compared the chemical composition of the aerosol produced by IQOS with the smoke from a reference cigarette designed for scientific research purposes and found that the levels of HPHCs in the aerosol are reduced on average by 90 to 95 percent compared with those found in the reference cigarette’s smoke.', 'In addition, extensive chemical characterization of the IQOS aerosol showed that there are approximately 10 times fewer constituents in IQOS aerosol than in the reference cigarette smoke.', '• No negative impact on overall indoor air quality: We also conducted chemistry and quality studies, which demonstrated that the use of IQOS does not negatively impact indoor air quality.', '• Reduced toxicity: We conducted toxicological studies for IQOS, both in vitro and in vivo, to determine whether the reduced formation of HPHCs in the aerosol leads to reduced toxicity.', 'Results from the in vitro studies show that the IQOS aerosol is significantly less cytotoxic and genotoxic than the smoke from cigarettes.', 'The in vivo studies found that, compared with cigarette smoke, the reduced exposure to toxicants results in significantly reduced lung inflammation and respiratory toxicity.', '• Reduced risk of cardiovascular disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and lung cancer in laboratory models: We conducted several systems toxicology studies to assess the disease-relevant biological mechanisms affected by exposure to toxicants, using human-derived in vitro cell cultures and organotypic tissue cultures.', 'These showed that, compared with the reference cigarette smoke, the IQOS aerosol has a significantly reduced impact on key mechanisms involved in the development of respiratory and cardiovascular diseases.', 'We also completed an in vivo study to assess the potential of the IQOS aerosol to reduce the risk of lung inflammation, emphysema, and lung cancer compared with cigarette smoke.', 'The results of this study show that, in contrast to cigarette smoke, the aerosol of IQOS does not increase the incidence and number of lung tumors.', 'It also confirmed a significantly reduced effect of IQOS aerosol on lung inflammation and emphysema.', 'PLATFORM DEVELOPMENT A smoke-free product’s risk reduction potential relies on the quality of the initial product design and on strict manufacturing controls to ensure that the product

safety concerns and health-related adverse events potentially associated with the use of our smoke- free products.', 'Further, we conduct post-market studies to understand how IQOS is used and by

participants, we have been able to measure IQOS use patterns among adult users over time.', 'Overall, the data from these studies confirm that IQOS is reaching the intended audience of adult smokers (with a significant proportion of individuals who purchase the product switching fully to it and stopping smoking) and is of very limited interest to adults who have never used nicotine products or who had already stopped using tobacco.', 'Finally, our post-market studies confirm that consumers understand that IQOS presents less risk than cigarettes but is not risk-free and presents more risk than tobacco and nicotine cessation.', 'PERCEPTION AND BEHAVIOR Perception and behavior studies help us evaluate risk perceptions and patterns of use of smoke-free products among various adult consumer groups.', 'For smoke-free products to have an overall positive impact on public health, it is important that adult smokers use them, that those intending to quit tobacco and nicotine altogether are not dissuaded by these products, and that nonsmokers do not use them.', '• Nicotine uptake: When a smoker is switching to IQOS, the nicotine uptake and urge-to-smoke scores are comparable to continued smoking.', 'This suggests that switchers can find IQOS acceptable and satisfying as an alternative to smoking.', '• Reduced exposure to harmful chemicals: Our clinical studies on IQOS completed to date have involved thousands of participants and up to 12 months of exposure.', 'They have found that smokers who switched completely to IQOS during the studies were exposed to significantly lower levels of harmful chemicals compared with those who continued to smoke.', 'Further, they showed that the levels of 15 biomarkers of exposure in participants switching completely to IQOS were comparable to the levels of those who quit tobacco and nicotine for the duration of the study.', '• Positive impact on smokers’ health: In a six-month clinical study of healthy volunteers, we measured eight health indicators that are known to change favorably following smoking cessation.', 'We observed that after participants had switched from smoking to IQOS for six months, each of these indicators improved in the direction expected upon smoking cessation, five of them with statistical significance.', 'We completed a six-month extension study to understand what the same markers look like 12 months after switching.', 'CLINICAL ASSESSMENT Clinical assessments help determine the extent to which adult smokers would find the product an acceptable alternative to cigarettes.', 'They assess whether a reduction in the formation of HPHCs measured in the laboratory leads to a reduction in HPHC exposure when an adult smoker switches to the product and investigate whether switching from cigarettes to a smoke-free product has a beneficial effect on a smoker’s health profile by reducing the risk of smoking- related diseases compared with continued smoking.', '• Long-term effects of product use: Long-term epidemiological data are needed to accurately quantify the overall disease risk reduction effect associated with switching from cigarette smoking to the use of smoke-free products, as well as to evaluate the excess disease risk associated with the use of these products compared with not using tobacco and nicotine.', 'Generating reliable epidemiological evidence requires that smoke-free products be available on the market for many years.', 'Further, the products must be used for a sufficiently long period by a sufficient portion of adult smokers who have switched to them.', 'This renders epidemiological studies impracticable in a premarket setting or in the early phase of market introduction.', '• Real-world evidence: We initiated time-trend studies in 2020 to complement our other research.', 'These studies use existing data to estimate the prevalence and incidence of disease.', 'They explore factors associated with health outcomes at the population level.', 'Independent evidence already links the launch of IQOS to an accelerated decline in cigarette sales in Japan, the first country in which IQOS was launched nationwide, in 2015.', 'We assessed time series of Japanese hospital data and health insurance claims for two smoking-related diseases (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and ischemic heart disease) to detect a potential impact of the introduction of IQOS at the population level.', 'We obtained hospitalization rates for selected smoking-related endpoints: COPD, COPD exacerbations, and ischemic heart disease.', 'This data came from two databases: Medical Data Vision and Japan Medical Data Center.', 'We compared rates of hospitalization for these endpoints before and after the introduction of heated tobacco products (HTPs) in Japan.', 'We found that observed hospitalization rates dropped below predicted rates shortly after launch.', 'Those decreases so far are modest but measurable.', 'There are many limitations to this type of research, and these results by themselves do not indicate a causal relationship.', 'We are therefore assessing the possibility of running the same type of assessment in other countries where HTP uptake is sufficient and real-world datasets are available.', 'In addition, independent studies that measure disease risk using epidemiology are starting to emerge (see the example from South Korea using data from the National Health Insurance Service on the next page).', 'LONG-TERM ASSESSMENT We continue to assess our smoke-free products after they are on the market.', 'Long-term assessment will confirm whether these products reduce the risk of smoking-related disease.', 'a\\u2002Visit PMIscience.com to read our scientific results to date with our smoke-free

also need to understand that quitting tobacco and nicotine altogether is the best option and that smoke-free products are not risk- free and contain nicotine, which is addictive.', 'We apply strict principles regarding with whom, how, and where we communicate about the existence and risks and benefits of our smoke-free products.', 'These principles are crystallized in our Marketing Codes.', 'We seek to provide accurate and non-misleading information so that those adults who would otherwise continue to smoke are motivated to switch.', 'Our premarket and post-market studies guide our consumer-facing activities and communication, including the internal assessment of product claims and consumer messages.', 'A cross-functional team of scientists, market researchers, lawyers, communication experts, and marketers review product claims and consumer messages about our product features and benefits, ensuring that all statements are accurate, clear, and non-misleading.', 'The lack of information about—and awareness of—smoke-free products presents a big hurdle to achieving tobacco harm reduction.', 'It is also potentially the easiest to overcome: Public health policymakers, regulatory bodies, the scientific community, and civil society have a big impact on smokers’ decisions.', 'It is therefore imperative that these entities do their part in informing adult smokers who otherwise would not quit about the risks and benefits of switching to smoke-free products.', 'As of the end of 2021, we estimate that only 25 percent of adult smokers in the markets in which PMI commercializes IQOS were aware of the product’s features and benefits compared with cigarette smoking.1 Growing external scientific consensus We welcome and encourage independent research on our products, methods, and results.', 'Over the past several years, a growing number of organizations and institutions have initiated studies of our smoke-free products or the methods and results surrounding them.', 'Several government agencies have already reviewed the available evidence or conducted research of their own (see overview on PMI.com).', 'In addition to studies on aerosol chemistry and toxicology, the first independent clinical and post-market studies have begun to emerge.', 'One example of encouraging real-world evidence supporting the harm reduction potential of smoke-free products comes from South Korea.', 'By using data from their National Health Insurance Service researchers were able to showcase that, compared with continued smoking, switching to smoke-free products was associated with 23 percent lower risk of developing cardiovascular disease among both recent switchers and long- term switching.1 Long-term quitters, or those who had quit all products for more than five years, were associated with 37 percent lower risk.', 'The list of independent studies (close to 280 in total) published around PMI’s smoke-free products or our methods and

markets covered in 2020, however, the proportion has increased from 36 percent in 2020 to 40 percent in 2021.', 'Broadening access to smoke-free products The public health benefit of smoke-free products depends not only on their potential to reduce the individual risk of smoking-related disease but also on their actual use by adult smokers as alternatives to cigarettes and other combusted tobacco products.', 'For smokers to switch to them, these alternatives must be known and accessible.', 'To the extent permitted, we deploy relentless efforts to improve and increase consumer awareness, acceptability, availability, and affordability of our smoke-free products.', 'Acting on these four access drivers will best position us to achieve two critical ambitions by 2025: for our smoke-free products to be available for sale in 100 markets and for at least 40 million adults to have switched to them and stopped smoking.', 'We want our smoke-free products to serve every adult smoker who does not quit smoking, and we plan for at least half of those markets to be in low- and middle-income markets, bolstered by new innovative solutions for consumers with lower purchasing power.', 'As of the end of 2021, 21.7 million adults were using our smoke-free products, of whom we estimate that 15.3 million had switched to these products and stopped smoking, and PMI smoke-free products were available for sale in 71 markets.', 'Informing the world about the smoke-free category Unlike combusted tobacco products, smoke-free alternatives are a new product category and are still relatively unfamiliar to most people.', 'In 2019, we launched “Unsmoke”—a global corporate campaign deployed across various online and offline communications channels to address widespread misconceptions about the smoke- free category and the concepts that underpin it (e.g., combustion, the role of nicotine, and the potential of these products for public health).', 'The campaign’s core message is simple: Currently, the campaign encompasses two distinct strands: • Unsmoke Your World (UYW): Calls for positive change by reinforcing that quitting tobacco and nicotine altogether is the best choice and informing the adult general public that better, smoke- free alternatives exist for those adult smokers who would otherwise continue smoking.', 'It also encourages the public to get involved and calls for regulation that would allow adult smokers access to—and information about—better alternatives.', '• Unsmoke Your Mind (UYM): Speaks to the regulatory and scientific community and other stakeholders with an interest in tobacco harm reduction policy.', 'UYM challenges misconceptions around the smoke-free category and calls for an open and transparent conversation to support risk-proportionate regulation that differentiates smoke-free products from cigarettes.', 'It also urges policymakers to put science and evidence at the center of decision-making.', 'C A S E S T U DY

category and the potential benefits of switching to smoke-free products (compared to continued smoking) leaves many smokers unmotivated to switch.', 'There also continues to be a profound lack of understanding that, when it comes to cigarette smoking, it is combustion, rather than nicotine, that is the primary cause of harm and disease (read more here about nicotine science).', 'To raise awareness, resolve biases, and clear up misconceptions, we engage with adult smokers to ensure they understand the facts underlying scientifically substantiated smoke-free products and why they can be

routes to consumers—including our stores and e-commerce channels—allows us to explain the products, their features, and their risks and benefits compared with continued smoking.', 'Leveraging the power of our brands to drive positive behavior change We engage with adult smokers in a variety of ways, including, where permitted, by leveraging our cigarette packaging.', 'JustScan (formerly ScanPack) is a mobile digital platform that allows adult smokers to access online content by scanning a QR code or using a weblink (typically featured on the cigarette pack insert).', 'For communication on combustible products, the platform uses third party-tested facial age-estimation technology to limit targeted communication to adult smokers.', 'In markets where smoke-free products are available, we leverage JustScan to drive awareness and support conversion to these products by providing adult smokers with access to content related to our smoke-free products.', 'For example, in November and December 2021, our affiliate in Japan deployed JustScan to increase awareness of IQOS ILUMA, reaching close to 150,000 adult smokers.', 'Globally in 2021, we used JustScan to successfully engage with close to two million adult smokers in 50 markets (2020: 850,000 adult smokers in 30 markets).', 'Reaching the right audience Our marketing efforts are governed by our Marketing Codes,

commercial activities must strike the right balance between encouraging adult smokers to switch to smoke-free products and minimizing the risk of unintended consequences such as youth access, initiation, and use by nonsmokers.', 'The results of our perception and behavior assessment studies conducted to date as part of the scientific assessment of our IQOS product show that the adult consumer groups surveyed have a very good understanding that IQOS presents less risk than cigarettes but is not risk-free and is riskier than tobacco and nicotine cessation.', 'Additionally, when assessed in the context of specific communication materials, more than 90 percent of participants in consumer studies understood that IQOS is not intended for nonsmokers, and more than 80 percent comprehended that quitting the use of all tobacco is the best way to reduce the risk of tobacco-related disease.', 'Further, we conducted 12 studies of our heat-not- burn (IQOS) and e-vapor (IQOS VEEV) products in six markets in 2020–21, including interviews with more than 23,000 adults who were not consumers of tobacco or nicotine products.', 'The results of those studies show very low intention to use our smoke-free products among adult former users of tobacco or nicotine products (0.6 percent) and adults who had never used tobacco or nicotine products (0.3 percent).', 'We do not conduct studies involving individuals under the legal age to purchase tobacco products.', 'However, results of our studies among the youngest legal age adults who were not consumers of tobacco or nicotine products— those aged 18 (or higher, depending on the legal age in the country) to 24—show a very low intent to use our smoke-free products (0.3 percent).', 'We also conduct post-market studies to understand how our smoke-free products are used and by whom once available for purchase in a market.', 'These are necessary to confirm the results of our premarket perception and behavior

smoke-free consumables require the use of devices.', 'Adult smokers who want to switch to our heat-not- burn or e-vapor products, for instance, must first buy a specific electronic device.', 'These high- quality devices rely on innovative technologies and require significant production costs to ensure they function consistently within the precise specifications of our scientific evidence package.', 'To address the potential cost barrier for adult smokers who would like to switch, we deploy various solutions, such as: • Initial lending of the device or payment over time • Enhanced battery and firmware performance and increased longevity of devices, which lowers the average annual cost for the user while also improving the ecological footprint of our devices • A broadened portfolio offering different price points.', 'For instance, in 2021, we continued to commercialize the licensed lil SOLID device, for use with Fiit consumables, at a price below the lowest- priced IQOS device in select markets.', 'Also, we may lower the price of existing device versions following the launch of new versions.', 'The retail price of these devices ranges from around USD 16 to USD 153, depending on model and country, with the global average price for the lowest-priced heat-not-burn device (including IQOS and lil) being USD 24.', '• Remarketing of used products collected from

touchpoints dedicated to PMI’s portfolio of smoke-free products, representing the most experiential physical retail formats, and delivering the highest level of experience with the broadest range of products and services to legal age consumers.', '3 IQOS partners (indirect retail brand experience touchpoints) consist of a dedicated IQOS space within another retailer’s premises where brand experiences and services are delivered to adult consumers by the retailer staff.', 'In this format both devices and consumables are generally commercialized.', 'Philip Morris International – Integrated Report 2021 80 81 Overview Strategy Operational impact Product impact Fundamentals Reporting and performance', 'Maximize the benefits of smoke-free products Consumables Our portfolio includes nicotine-containing consumables to be used with our electronic devices.', 'These include the HTUs used with our heat-not- burn products and the liquid nicotine used with our e-vapor products.', 'We also produce nicotine- containing consumables (e.g., nicotine pouches) that do not require the use of an electronic device.', 'The recommended price of these consumables (whether as a complement to a device or as stand- alone product) plays an important role in determining affordability and consequently expanding access.', 'The recommended price of our consumables depends on R&D, production, compliance and commercialization costs, as well as the excise taxation regime in the countries where they are sold.', 'Currently, the production costs of the heated tobacco units used with IQOS devices are, on average, somewhat higher than those of cigarettes.', 'HTUs undergo a proprietary manufacturing process that is vastly different from the manufacture of cigarettes, and they require an increased level of quality assurance in factories.', 'The manufacture of HTUs also incurs other costs that do not apply to cigarettes, such as the costs of scientifically substantiating the reduced-risk profile of these products, and ongoing post-market studies.', 'Importantly, they entail much higher commercialization costs compared with cigarettes due to the need to properly introduce consumers to these new products and explain their functionalities.', 'These costs include, for example, our customer care call centers and follow-up to ensure users do not fall back into smoking during their conversion journeys.', 'Beyond production and commercialization costs, a key factor driving tobacco and nicotine product retail prices is the excise tax.', 'Excise taxes on cigarettes are generally higher than those on smoke-free products.', 'Within the smoke-free category, electronic cigarettes tend to be taxed at a lower rate than heated tobacco products.', 'Differential taxation is an appropriate fiscal policy given the fundamentally different risk profiles of combustible tobacco products versus smoke-free alternatives.', 'Applied appropriately, this approach can incentivize adult smokers to switch away from cigarettes and other combustible tobacco products and encourage manufacturers to channel their investments and R&D away from cigarettes and toward smoke-free alternatives.', 'The combined effect of manufacturer costs and tax differences is such that the price to the consumer of IQOS HTUs is typically below that of premium cigarettes—or can even be at the low end of cigarette pricing.', 'As of the end of 2021, we estimate that our HTUs are on average priced the same as or lower than an adult smoker’s current cigarette brand for 58 percent of smokers in the geographies where we commercialize IQOS.', 'To address potential affordability barriers, we are also expanding consumers’ choice of HTUs by offering brands at multiple price points in many markets.', 'As of year-end 2021, we offered a price point below our main HTU brand in 21 markets.', 'Marketing and selling our products responsibly Consumer-centric product design, development, marketing, sales, communications, and engagement drive our commercial success and propel our smoke- free mission.', 'In this context, responsible sales and marketing practices are critical priorities for PMI.', 'We aim to design our marketing communications and materials to appeal to adult smokers and adult users of nicotine products, and we follow strict principles to minimize the risk of unintended consequences, such as youth access to our products.', 'This is an ongoing effort and we strive to improve continuously.', 'Rolling out our updated Marketing Codes Consistent with our category-based organization, our marketing and sales principles and practices are codified in two separate Marketing Codes: one for combusted tobacco products (an enhanced version of the previous Marketing Code that had been in place for years) and one for smoke- free (or “noncombusted”) alternatives.', 'We rolled out these Codes internally early in 2021, building on our previous Marketing Code centered on combusted tobacco products and the Good Conversion Practices we had established to govern the marketing and sale of our smoke- free products.', 'During the year, we worked to embed the norms of these Codes within our organization and trained employees and relevant third parties.', 'We closely guided our markets during the roll-out period and encouraged them to provide feedback and seek clarification as needed.', 'We have now published our two Codes on our website and welcome stakeholder feedback on our responsible commercialization practices.', 'Our Marketing Codes are accompanied by a set of internal guidelines that provide more detailed information on implementation.', 'These guidelines cover, among other things, how to develop appropriate consumer messaging, set up effective youth access prevention programs, communicate digitally with consumers, and conduct market research for smoke-free products.', 'Governance of the Marketing Codes The Codes are intended to guide the design, marketing, and sale of our products.', 'They include the core principles, practices, and governance processes we follow in developing, designing, marketing, and selling our products and in engaging with adult consumers of our products.', 'Sometimes our Codes impose more stringent provisions than required under local laws; in such cases, we follow our Codes.', 'If the opposite occurs and local laws set a stricter standard than our Codes, we, of course, follow the law.', 'The Codes are subject to a robust governance process established in 2021 under the responsibility of the newly formed Marketing Review Council, composed of members of our Company Management.', 'The council’s role includes guiding implementation of the Codes across the organization.', 'Deployment Review Group Each of our affiliates has a local cross-functional team (a Deployment Review Group or DRG) in place that provides a robust process for reviewing and approving new products, packaging, consumer-facing programs, campaigns, and initiatives before they are deployed.', 'We expect every market to fully implement the Codes and are implementing a self-assessment process to confirm they do.', 'Findings and actions resulting from these self-assessments will be shared with regional and functional senior management before being reported to our President, Smoke-Free Products Category & Chief Consumer Officer and our President, Combustibles Category & Global Combustibles Marketing.', 'Philip Morris International – Integrated Report 2021 82 83 Overview Strategy Operational impact Product impact Fundamentals Reporting and performance', 'Maximize the benefits of smoke-free products Employee and third-party training Our responsible commercialization efforts rely on the adherence and dedication of our employees and the third parties with whom we work.', 'All PMI employees involved in PMI’s commercialization activities must be trained on the Codes and follow them.', 'Third parties involved in PMI’s commercialization activities must also be trained on the relevant parts of the Codes and follow them.', 'We deployed new training in 2021 in parallel with the release of our Marketing Codes and their accompanying implementation guidelines to ensure employees and third parties understand our principles and practices and embed them in their work.', 'In addition to global compliance e-learning, our affiliates rolled out instructor-led classroom and online training sessions for employees and third parties involved in the commercialization of PMI products to ensure wide reach and proper awareness and comprehension of the Codes’ expectations.', 'In 2021, more than 70,000 people participated in at least one Marketing Codes-related training session (including on youth access prevention requirements).', 'Of this total, around 23,000 were PMI employees and around 47,000 were third-party workers, including agencies, promotional staff, call center agents, and shop assistants, among others.', 'To ensure continuous reinforcement and proper implementation of the Codes’ requirements, we plan to train all relevant employees and third parties on the Marketing Codes at least every two years.', 'Further, we expect to conduct annual training on youth access prevention requirements among all affiliates’ salespersons engaged in brand retail or in our contact centers.', 'Monitoring and remediation Three functions (Ethics & Compliance, Risk & Controls, and Corporate Audit) support and monitor compliance with the Marketing Codes and their implementation guidelines through training, communications, controls, investigations, and audits.', 'Our Ethics & Compliance function investigates potential incidents of noncompliance with laws and PMI’s Marketing Codes.', 'In 2021, there were 13 violations of our Marketing Codes by PMI employees (2020: 29).', 'As a consequence of these violations, we took disciplinary actions, of which 15 percent consisted of employment termination, 8 percent in suspension, 15 percent in written warning, and 62 percent in verbal warning or counselling.', 'Further, the risk of marketing and selling to youth is covered in our annual enterprise risk assessment and in our risk-based audit program.', 'Reviews by our Corporate Audit department in 2021 found that only a few affiliates experienced issues related to responsible marketing compliance, and these issues were mainly procedural.', 'During the year, Corporate Audit conducted 19 audits covering 24 markets.', 'Processes and controls were reviewed in each of these markets, and members of the Corporate Audit team visited a limited number of points of sale (COVID-19 restrictions did not permit field visits to some) to assess the steps taken to implement our Marketing Codes.', 'No significant issues related to youth access were identified in the locations visited, except for one case where the agreed implementation steps were not executed as planned, mainly due to COVID-19-related restrictions.', 'The affiliate implemented all four identified management action plans by October 2021 in line with the requirements of the Marketing Codes.', 'In markets selling smoke-free products, we also conduct a mystery shopping program.', 'As part of this program, we determine whether the requirements on youth access prevention set out in our Marketing Codes are being implemented across our e-commerce websites, brand retail sites, and contact centers.', 'Read more on the next page.', 'Insider insights: Mystery shopping program In addition to other controls we have in place, our bespoke mystery shopping program (MSP) helps us monitor and measure adherence to our requirements on youth access prevention as set out in our Marketing Codes across different touchpoints.', 'MSP leverages trained “mystery shoppers” commissioned by an independent third party.', 'The shoppers are at least 19 years old, and all of them are smokers.', 'They are tasked with acting interested in PMI smoke-free products and with going through various service interactions, such as making a purchase at an IQOS store, placing an online product order, or interacting with an IQOS coach.', 'While doing so, they assess and record not only their consumer experience and the quality of service delivered, but also whether appropriate control measures were exercised to determine and verify (a) their age and (b) whether they are smokers or users of nicotine products.', 'We receive detailed and regular reports on the mystery shoppers’ feedback, allowing us to identify cases in which adherence to our requirements is not being met.', 'We piloted this program in seven markets in 2017, focusing on PMI’s IQOS boutiques.', 'In the ensuing years, we significantly increased the scale of our efforts.', 'By the end of 2021, the MSP had been implemented across our IQOS stores, contact centers, and e-commerce sites (depending on the retail and support channels available) in 60 markets where our smoke-free products are commercialized.', 'Where COVID-19 conditions allowed it, mystery shoppers performed around 2,500 visits in 2021 to over 640 IQOS stores, visiting on different days and at different times of the day.', 'In over 96 percent of those cases, they reported that their age had been properly checked prior to starting the conversation about the product—unless their appearance made clear that the mystery shopper was above the minimum legal age (or at least 18 years old in markets without a minimum legal age).', 'Although the pandemic constrained our abilities to monitor on the ground, the program was still implemented online.', 'The MSP is an additional and valued due diligence tool that helps ensure we reach our desired audience—adult smokers and users of nicotine products—while minimizing the risk of unintended consequences such as access to and use of our smoke-free products by youth.', 'It provides a powerful way to ensure our age verification requirements are implemented properly on the ground across selected consumer-facing channels.', 'And it is not only about measurement: The wealth of data collected from the program is turned into targeted actions to continuously guard against youth accessing our products.', '>70,000 PMI employees and third-party workers participated in at least one Marketing

the benefits of smoke-free products Consumer communications and labeling Along with applicable laws, we apply strict rules governing how we present our products to adult consumers.', 'Labeling We warn consumers about the health effects of our products.', 'All advertising and consumer packaging for combusted tobacco products and smoke-free alternatives must contain clear and visible health warnings, even in markets where not required by law.', 'Our smoke-free consumables packaging indicates clearly that the product is for adults, is not risk-free, and contains nicotine, which is addictive.', 'No product placement With regard to both our combusted and smoke- free products, we do not pay for product or brand placement in entertainment programs, films, radio, video games, or any other program intended for or disseminated to the general public.', 'Moreover, our advertising, marketing, and sales materials must be placed where they are likely to reach adult smokers and not in places or channels frequented primarily by minors (i.e., they can only be placed in media channels whose audience is reasonably estimated to be at least 75 percent above legal age).', 'Social media We do not use social media for marketing, advertising, or any other promotional communications related to our combustible products, whether branded or not.', 'The same rule applies to our contracted parties, including event organizers, third-party agencies, and brand ambassadors.', 'Unlike with combustible tobacco products, we maintain consumer-facing branded social media accounts for our smoke-free products in certain markets.', 'We do so only in countries where reliable audience data show that the audience of the relevant social media platform is at least 75 percent adult.', 'In addition, we use all available native age gates.', 'In 2019, it was brought to our attention that some social media posts, while in line with applicable laws, did not comply with our internal “digital influencer” guidelines.', 'Consequently, our Senior Management Team decided to suspend the use of social media influencers for the purposes of online marketing.', 'Since then, our company has worked hard on strengthening and building more robust systems and processes, including by exploring the use of previously unavailable age-control technology, to ensure our online engagement is reaching the right kind of audience.', 'Further, and to limit the reach of our marketing communications, we do not encourage adult consumers to share commercial content related to our smoke-free products on their personal social media accounts.', 'In 2022, we will continue to evaluate the best way to continue responsibly increasing awareness, while preventing unintended consequences.', 'Preventing youth access and use of our products As a leading manufacturer of tobacco and nicotine products, we have a critical role to play in guarding against youth access to our products.', 'Accordingly, we have developed an enhanced suite of measures designed to ensure a holistic approach to guard against youth access to our products.', 'We deploy measures to ensure consumers are age-verified across all access channels when being provided with access to our products, including both PMI owned and operated boutiques and e-commerce platforms, and third-party retailers and online marketplaces.', 'While the level of control we have over these channels varies, it is critically important that we make every effort to guard against youth access to our products regardless of venue.', 'In addition, we strongly support regulation that ensures that only adults can buy tobacco and nicotine-containing products, as well as the strict enforcement of minimum age laws and penalties for those who sell or provide these products to minors.', 'The global youth access prevention requirements in our Marketing Codes apply to all our commercial activities, even when not required by local laws.', 'These stringent standards reduce the likelihood that our products and related consumer communications will be of particular appeal to youth.', 'These requirements shape the content of our creative materials, ensuring, for instance, that they do not contain images of models who are, or appear to be, under age 25 or images of youth-oriented celebrities.', 'We have also implemented a central governance process under which new flavored heated tobacco products, e-vapor products, and combusted products are evaluated.', 'Under this framework, flavored product propositions are assessed premarket to minimize the risk that their introduction in the marketplace generates unintended consequences.', 'While flavors are essential to encourage adult smokers to switch, and their use should be preserved, certain flavors could be particularly appealing to unintended audiences and should not be used.', 'In all circumstances, every tobacco and nicotine product should be regulated, including the way they are marketed, to ensure they do not particularly appeal to unintended audiences, including youth.', 'Engaging with our trade partners (B2B) We do not own or control the vast majority of retail outlets in which people buy our products: Around 99 percent of our sales occur outside our owned channels.', 'To ensure retailers operate according to our standards, we set robust requirements for our trade partners.', 'We work with them to ensure they understand why they should not sell tobacco or nicotine products to youth.', 'To ensure compliance, we monitor the implementation of youth access prevention (YAP) programs in our indirect retail channels and are committed to maintaining high coverage of our shipment volumes (minimum 90 percent).', 'In 2021, we evolved our minimum requirements for an effective YAP program in our indirect retail channels, which have been integrated into our Marketing Codes.', 'Our YAP tools include templates for contract clauses requiring that retailers ensure strict compliance with minimum age laws or, in the absence of such laws, that they refuse sales of nicotine-containing products to anyone below 18 years old.', 'The tools also include educational modules and knowledge checks for both combusted and smoke-free products, made available via the digital communication platform we use with our retail partners across more than 85 markets.', 'Other tools we provide include point-of-sale signage, communication templates, and talking points to guide in-person conversations with trade partners.', 'By the end of the year, markets representing 91 percent of our total shipment volume were implementing these YAP programs in our indirect retail channels.', 'Age verification in our owned channels (B2C) In owned channels (such as our IQOS stores and e-commerce sites), our Marketing Codes, youth access prevention (YAP) guidelines, and training materials and tools require that consumers’ age is verified before they can access our products— ensuring they are of legal age (or at least 18 years old in markets without a minimum legal age).', 'What is a youth access prevention program?', 'A youth access prevention (YAP) program is a combination of guidelines and tools to help our affiliates work more effectively with their trade partners to guard against sales of our combusted and smoke-free products to underage

mystery shoppers to assess the consumer experience delivery, the quality of service offered, and compliance to our requirements (read more here).', 'IQOS stores At our physical brand retail outlets, any consumer who wishes to purchase our products is age-verified by a trained salesperson.', 'The verification must be conducted in person and, if there is any doubt that the person is an adult, by checking an official identity document.', 'E-commerce We implement age verification prior to selling our products online.', 'This requires, for example, that we can leverage databases from reliable and credible sources (such as government organizations, telephone network operators, or banks) or scan an uploaded copy of a person’s identity document.', 'Where the necessary technology is not yet available, or where a person cannot be age verified using either of these methods, alternative age-verification processes are applied—including face-to-face age verification on delivery by couriers or at collection pick-up points.', 'Enhanced electronic age-verification technology Beyond our existing youth access prevention programs, we continue to develop technology to minimize unintended use and prevent youth from initiating or using our smoke-free devices.', 'An example of this is our proprietary age- verification technology embedded in our VEEV products.', 'To test its efficacy, we began a pilot in 2020, testing this technology in New Zealand, which continued during the first half of 2021.', 'This specific form of age-verification technology required the consumer to prove their age with reliable online data, in order to be able to unlock, and thereby activate the device prior to first use.', 'If the device was not linked to an age-verified consumer profile, the device would then remain blocked and unusable.', 'On the contrary, once unlocked, the device would be activated and the adult consumer would have the ability to lock and unlock it—at their convenience—to prevent unintended use.', 'Key learnings from New Zealand highlighted that it is critical to ensure a simple and easy to use mechanism for consumers to be age verified, as well as to activate their devices.', 'Moreover, we learned that on the consumer conversion journey, an overly complex age-verification process would represent a barrier in their decision to abandon cigarette smoking and switch to a smoke-free alternative.', 'We deployed a second pilot with VEEV in two cities on the island of Corsica, in France in 2021.', 'These pilots confirmed our learnings from New Zealand and the need to further optimize these novel technologies, processes, consumer journey, and user experience.', 'During 2022, we plan to launch additional pilots which will include testing of different user experiences, a suite of online age-verification mechanisms, and various methods to perform device activation.', 'Fundamental to the viability of these efforts will be to ensure that the underlying infrastructure is scalable.', 'Secure and user-friendly age-verification technology is a novel advance in the smoke-free product category and requires strong partnerships with information technology service providers, as well as with the owners of various software applications.', 'Our teams continue to engage with the leading hardware and software players in these industries, to ensure that the most robust and best-in-class technology is available for PMI’s smoke-free products.', 'Based on the New Zealand and Corsica pilot learnings, its benefits and challenges, during 2022 we will continue to develop and test a range of age-verification technologies, with a focus on online age-verification.', 'We will utilize these current and future learnings to guide our ambitions and assess our targets, remaining steadfast in our commitment to prevent access to these products by unintended audiences.', 'Looking ahead More than a decade ago, PMI set itself the goal to re-focus its business and develop products that can reduce the risk of smoking-related diseases compared with cigarette smoking while in parallel phasing out cigarettes.', 'Science and technology are at the core and key enablers for this ambition.', 'So far, we could demonstrate that our heated tobacco and e-cigarette products significantly reduce the formation and exposure to harmful chemicals as well as the risk of smoking- related diseases in animal models.', 'But this is only the starting point.', 'Moving forward, and building on the past decade of experience, capability build up and scientific work, we have started to execute a significant program of biomarker, clinical outcome and real-world evidence studies to demonstrate the individual clinical and public health benefit of our smoke-free products.',

respiratory drug development company with a late-stage inhalable acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) candidate for the prevention and treatment of acute myocardial infarction.', 'ASPRIHALE® is a patented, dry powder inhalation ASA, delivered through a unique self-administered aerosol.', 'It is designed for patients at risk of heart attacks.', 'In clinical trials, ASPRIHALE® catalyzed peak plasma concentration and pharmacodynamic (PD) effect in two minutes due to its inhalation approach, compared with the 28 minutes coated chewable aspirin took.', 'This speed is unprecedented and can have significant implications for reducing the risk of morbidity and mortality.', 'Cardiologists agreed that the rapid drug exposure and PD effects would be beneficial, especially during the time before the patient arrives at the hospital.', 'In the U.S. alone, someone has a heart attack every 40 seconds.', 'With its inhalable version of ASA, OtiTopic has developed an asset that promises to have a much faster onset of effect compared with oral ASA.', 'PMI looks forward to completing the planned ASPRIHALE® registration program and bringing this important treatment to market to address a significant unmet medical need in a clinical condition where every second counts.', 'In September, we announced the closing of the acquisition of Fertin Pharma, a leading developer and manufacturer of innovative pharmaceutical and well-being products based on oral and intraoral delivery systems.', 'With Fertin Pharma’s substantial know-how and oral delivery platforms, we plan to develop scientifically substantiated consumer health products, including over-the-counter solutions and supplements for better living in areas such as sleep, energy, calm, and focus.', 'By serving as a critical pillar of the new wellness and healthcare business, as part of PMI’s transformation, Fertin will be uniquely positioned to continue to innovate and grow— delivering on our vision of enabling people to live healthier lives.', 'Our shared commitment to science and consumer-centric innovation forms a strong basis for a very successful future together.', 'Fertin will also continue to grow and serve external customers as a leading contract development and manufacturing company (CDMO) in the oral formulation space.', 'Furthermore, we acquired Vectura, a leading specialist inhalation CDMO that provides innovative inhaled drug development solutions to help clients bring inhalable medicines to patients.', 'The market for inhaled therapeutics is growing rapidly outside the traditional spaces where inhalable medicines have been used over the years, focusing on specialty disease areas with high unmet medical need and hence with significant potential to expand into new application areas beyond the current market offering.', 'Within the context of our new wellness and healthcare business, Vectura is well-positioned to address this market growth while becoming the backbone of the inhaled therapeutics arm.', 'PMI has made a clear commitment to advance Vectura’s existing strategy, expand it geographically, and extend the company into the development of proprietary inhaled therapeutic products, alongside its existing CDMO business.', 'This will benefit Vectura’s differentiated technologies and development expertise for the delivery of complex inhaled therapeutics and will enable us to bring our initial pipeline of inhaled therapeutic products to market.', 'Important to note is that we will be focusing on innovating in the method of delivery of existing approved

tons of plastic.', 'The largest share was bioplastics used in the filters of cigarettes and heated tobacco units.', 'Our management approach Progress in 2021 Our intention is to preserve resources, reduce waste, and prevent inappropriate disposal, including littering.', 'We do this by designing our products with the principles of circularity and waste reduction in mind, accounting for the products’ environmental impact at the early stages of development, and offering consumers solutions to play their part and dispose of end-of-life products appropriately.', 'To reduce post-consumer waste across our portfolio, we seek to design and implement impactful strategies tailored to our various products and packaging and tied to specific targets: • Cigarettes: We aim to reduce cigarette butt littering by encouraging behavior change through impactful awareness-raising campaigns and by empowering consumers to dispose of cigarette butts appropriately.', 'We also intend to tackle the issue at the source, continuously working to replace the plastic in filters with better, more sustainable alternatives.', '• Smoke-free consumables: As we grow our smoke-free business, we seek to ensure that the consumables used with our electronic devices are disposed of responsibly at their end-of-life and that users have access to take- back and recycling schemes that have an environmental benefit, are economically viable, and are valued by consumers.', 'Further, we strive to design new generations of consumables with waste reduction and recyclability in mind.', '• Smoke-free electronic devices: To reduce the depletion of finite resources, we aim to integrate sustainability into our product design, drive circularity by improving recyclability, and increase opportunities to refresh and repair used devices.', '• Packaging: We strive to minimize packaging materials and improve their circularity by increasing their recyclability and promoting the use of materials made from renewable resources.', 'Our strategies and related initiatives are guided by a set of policies and principles, including our Environmental Commitment, Anti-Littering Policy, and Sustainable Design Framework, complemented by specific internal guidelines.', 'In 2021, to accelerate the delivery of a smoke-free future, PMI established a new category management structure for its smoke-free and combustible cigarettes businesses.', 'Our President, Smoke-Free Products Category & Chief Consumer Officer and our President, Combustibles Category & Global Combustibles Marketing are responsible for driving our agenda on post-consumer waste management for their respective categories.', 'Additional efforts are steered cross-functionally.', 'With regard to our smoke-free products, we set up a dedicated cross- functional governance board in 2021 which oversees strategies and progress related to our device life extension and consumables end-of-life programs.', 'One of our main end goals is to tackle the plastic pollution caused by the littering of our products.', 'During 2021, as announced in our 2019 Integrated Report, we focused on better understanding our global plastic litter footprint.', 'To measure this, we combined data for our company’s overall plastics footprint with data collected from consumer behavior in different countries and for different products.', 'More concretely, for relevant plastic-containing products that we market (including consumables and packaging), we assessed littering rates through consumer surveys in our main markets.', 'We then calculated the resulting amount of plastic being littered by product based on full year sales data multiplied by plastic content and by littering rate.', 'In addition, following a 2020 pilot in Portugal, we fine-tuned our model to broaden its application and measure the prevalence of plastic litter resulting from our cigarettes and heated tobacco units found on the ground.', 'PMI’s 2021 plastic footprint For this initiative, we teamed with Litterati, the leading anti-littering organization, who collected litter data in more than 50 cities in 40 countries and photographed litter items in various urban environments.', 'Data analyst CARTO then extrapolated the georeferenced data collected locally to provide us with global figures.', 'A deeper analysis of the litter prevalence data revealed insights useful in improving our anti-littering campaigns.', 'For example, our study uncovered that cigarette butt litter is more prevalent in commercial, business, and commuting zones and lower in residential areas.', 'Food, drink, and leisure establishments, bus and train stops, and areas illuminated at night all showed higher litter prevalence.', 'Customizing awareness campaigns to users in these areas, therefore, can be more effective.', 'Working in collaboration with these partners allowed us to generate detailed litter prevalence maps for cities and countries worldwide that will inform future campaigns.', 'Note: Plastic footprint is calculated excluding KT&G commercialized by PMI, e-vapor products, and nicotine pouches.', 'In 2021, we adjusted our methodology to

Roadmap and Sustainability Index: for markets collectively covering more than 80 percent of our combustible product shipment volumes to deploy meaningful programs tackling cigarette butt littering by the end of 2025.', 'Design for circularity From an environmental perspective, the ideal and most sustainable scenario would be for our products to generate zero litter post-consumption.', 'We continue to work toward this goal, seeking design options that avoid, or at least significantly reduce, the polluting impact of litter.', 'Our intention is to develop filters with a significantly lower environmental footprint.', 'We are aware that materials changes alone will not solve the littering problem, but they may help mitigate the environmental impacts of residual littering by those consumers who do not engage in behavioral change driven by anti-littering programs.', 'For many years, we have been actively investing in R&D to explore and assess the viability of alternative cigarette filter materials that have a lower environmental impact than cellulose acetate (CA), an already renewable and partially biodegradable material.', 'We evaluate alternative filter materials via extensive analytical testing, machinability trials, biodegradation evaluations, and prototype testing among consumers to understand their acceptability.', 'The combination of these two exercises—calculating our global plastic litter footprint and the prevalence of plastic litter resulting from our consumables—proved to be a valuable learning experience, which honed our understanding of both the complexity of the issue and the need for concrete metrics to measure progress and guide our actions moving forward, in a way that can prove useful and impactful.', 'While our original intent was to leverage this methodology annually to monitor progress towards decreasing the amount of plastic littered, the exercise revealed limitations to this approach.', 'Limitations include the lack of reliable and standardized consumer behavior studies as well as the exacerbated reliance on assumptions and extrapolations which made the methodology unreliable, very expensive, and not very impactful.', 'We also realize there is a need to establish tailored and context-based targets, accompanied by detailed strategies and initiatives that can best encourage behavior change, prevent littering, and support cleanup activities, while defining concrete and clear ways to both define success and be able to measure progress towards achieving it.', 'Moreover, working toward removing plastic litter highlighted the opportunity business can have in offering opportunities for innovation to resolve systemic issues, like the one that relates to plastic litter.', 'There is a pressing need for our R&D to support ongoing efforts that holistically resolve the issue of plastic pollution, starting from its source.', 'This means finding ways in which we can reduce the amount of plastic

across the tobacco industry.1 Although most are disposed of properly post-consumption, too many are casually littered into the environment.', 'Our approach To tackle cigarette butt littering, we apply a three-pronged approach: 1.', 'Design for circularity: Invest in R&D toward filters made of more sustainable, plastic-free alternatives that allow faster biodegrading, resolving the issue of plastic litter altogether.', '2.', 'Encourage behavioral change: Inspire change in consumer habits through impactful anti-littering awareness programs and initiatives to empower consumers to dispose of cigarette butts properly.', 'These initiatives include communications campaigns and cleanup activities to raise awareness, partnerships, portable disposal solutions, and improvement of public equipment solutions.', '3.', 'Reduce litter on the ground through efficient and cost-effective collection schemes.', 'In the EU, cigarette manufacturers will be required to contribute to the costs of collecting and cleaning up cigarette butt litter.', 'The Single-Use Plastics (SUP) Directive requires that producers participate in industry-wide Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) schemes.', 'EPR is an established governance scheme for circular waste management; it is now being used for the first time in the EU to address the problem of littering.', 'We support the concept of an industry wide EPR, provided such schemes are managed in a cost- efficient, proportionate, and transparent way that addresses the objectives of reducing litter and changing consumer behavior.', 'Any new filter material or design must satisfy stringent criteria: • Comparable filtration efficiency and performance consistent with CA filters • Acceptable taste characteristics and experience for consumers • Similar or reduced material carbon footprint compared with CA filters • Substantial improvement in marine, aquatic, and soil biodegradation compared with CA filters or a significant reduction in the plastic content of the filter • Conduciveness to industrialization at scale Over the past years, some tested materials have met one or more of the above criteria but we are yet to find an alternative to CA that satisfies all five.', 'We will continue to explore options as new materials and processes become available, and science and innovation evolves.', 'In 2022, we plan to continue our exploration and use consumer research to better understand and validate consumer acceptance of alternative non-plastic filters in some of our key markets.', 'What are cigarette filters made of?', 'The main constituent of cigarette filters is cellulose acetate (CA), a bioplastic made from wood-based cellulose.', 'Contrary to common belief, CA does biodegrade over several months or years (depending on the surrounding conditions) and does not accumulate in the environment over time.', 'In contrast, conventional plastics made from petrochemicals take hundreds of years to degrade, often breaking down to form microplastics.', 'Philip Morris International – Integrated Report 2021 102 103 Overview Strategy Operational impact Product impact Fundamentals Reporting and performance', 'Reduce post-consumer waste Encourage behavior change While many consumers dispose of their waste properly, too much waste ends up in the environment.', 'We seek to help change behaviors to prevent cigarette butt littering and encourage proper waste disposal.', 'To that end, we run global and local awareness and anti-littering campaigns.', 'Tackling the issues of cigarette butt littering locally Smoking habits, environmental awareness, and disposal practices vary by country, so combating cigarette butt littering requires tailored approaches.', 'Accordingly, our affiliates follow a global methodology while also focusing on impactful, context-based strategies appropriate for their respective markets.', 'These local anti-littering campaigns are run by our affiliates, with central support and guidance.', 'In 2021, we had active campaigns in 46 countries.', 'Raising awareness globally As in previous years, we had the opportunity in 2021 to join the annual World Cleanup Day (where COVID-19 conditions allowed it).', 'Our affiliates’ participation in this global action—the world’s largest litter cleanup event—is part of our public sensitization efforts and signals our broader commitment to tackle the issue of cigarette butt littering.', 'While the pandemic limited many of the events we had planned, around 3,150 volunteers across 53 countries (including PMI employees and their friends and family members) actively contributed to picking up around 17 tons of litter.', 'We added a global challenge element to the activity through a partnership with Litterati, whereby participants could download a mobile app allowing them to log, tally, and share how much litter they collected.', 'We also further developed Our World Is Not an Ashtray, a web-based corporate platform to educate, inspire, and engage the public on the issue of littering.', 'Through this campaign, we share facts and figures, testimonials, and calls to action.', 'A few of our affiliates also use this platform as a basis for local awareness-raising initiatives.', 'In 2021, we also continued the deployment of our Marlboro limited-edition “Leave No Trace” pack, which communicates anti-littering messages to adult smokers in 11 markets (2020: nine).', 'During the year, more than 30 million packs were sold at more than 482,000 points of sale, and we estimate they reached more than 2.3 million adult smokers.', 'C

awareness-raising efforts and with a view to developing viable recycling solutions for cigarette butts.', 'For example, our affiliate in Mexico developed a comprehensive communication campaign that engages adult smokers and other citizens in helping to solve the problem of waste management.', 'The initiative has created a nationwide network of volunteer ambassadors who bring communities together to collect cigarette butts, with more than 400 collection points nationwide.', 'The team has also partnered with Ecofilter, an organization that has developed an innovative biotechnological treatment

areas, squares, and parks identified as priorities by local authorities—and on reaching significant numbers of consumers to drive societal change.', 'Insights gathered from our litter prevalence assessment in 2021 will help further guide our work, allowing us to strategically focus on those areas with the highest incidence of littering.', 'Cleanup campaigns are predominantly designed to raise public awareness of the littering problem in the communities in which they occur rather than resolving the problem of littering or replacing more cost-efficient public cleaning services.', 'For instance, in Canada, through a collaboration with the Great Outdoors Fund in 2021, we supported 20 local organizations with cleanup initiatives involving more than 600,000 volunteers who collectively donated over 10 million hours of their time to gather 1,700 tons of litter.', 'Managing waste from our smoke-free consumables We seek to minimize the environmental impact of the consumables used in our smoke-free category.', 'These include the heated tobacco units (HTUs) used with our heat-not-burn products (including the HEETS brand used with IQOS 3 DUO and previous generations, the TEREA sticks used with the new IQOS ILUMA, and the Fiit sticks used with lil devices), as well as the VEEV pods used with our e-vapor device.', 'With each product launch, we will evaluate the need for a consumables take-back program based on environmental impact, consumer need, and market feasibility.', 'Long term, we aim to reduce our post-consumer waste by design and explore low-carbon, recyclable, and biodegradable alternatives to the materials currently used in our smoke-free consumables.', 'In the interim, we are focused on establishing services to help our adult consumers reduce the end-of-life impact of our products.', 'The consumption and post-consumption behaviors related to our smoke-free products differ drastically from cigarette consumption.', 'Unlike cigarettes, HTUs do not need to be stubbed out after use, and they contain no smelly smoke residues, which makes them easier to keep until proper disposal and therefore less likely to be littered.', 'In 2020, we ran a survey in Lithuania to complement past studies in Greece, Italy, and Japan to measure the proportion of HTUs versus cigarette butts found on the ground.', 'In partnership with third-party experts at Cortexia, we then compared that figure with the market share of HTUs versus all tobacco products.', 'Across the three major cities in Lithuania, the percentage of used HTUs among tobacco products littered was between 2.4 and 4.5 times lower than their sales market share.', 'This finding suggests that a heated tobacco unit is on average three times less likely to be littered than a cigarette butt.', 'Philip Morris International – Integrated Report 2021 104 105 Overview Strategy Operational impact Product impact Fundamentals Reporting and performance', 'Reduce post-consumer waste “The

electronic waste), we will complement our centralized approach with local solutions.', 'We expect to leverage the learnings from our CIRCLE hubs to guide and centrally govern such local solutions, ensuring they are aligned with our standards and support progress toward our global recycling targets.', 'Embedding eco-design principles into our products Each product generation we launch incorporates improvements in quality, ease of use, durability, or performance.', 'Durability by design In 2021, we started the commercialization of the latest generation of our heat-not-burn devices, under the IQOS ILUMA brand.', 'These bladeless devices offer a cleaner way to heat tobacco from the core, without burning it, to provide a more consistent experience, no tobacco residue, and no need to clean the device.', 'This supports our objective to design products with a prolonged life cycle and to mitigate potential returns due to consumer complaints.', 'Further, it allowed us to minimize product accessories thus reducing the amount of resources and materials used, as cleaning sticks and other tools are no longer needed.', 'Reducing our product carbon footprint In general, our smoke-free products have a higher carbon footprint than combustible cigarettes.', 'This is primarily due to the inclusion of an electronic device, which involves new components and requires electricity to charge.', 'Additionally, the process used to manufacture consumables such as HTUs is more energy intensive than for cigarettes due to the production of cast leaf tobacco.', 'We are working to reduce the carbon footprint of new versions of our smoke-free products compared with previous ones through improved manufacturing processes, extending the usable life of our electronic devices, and decreasing the total carbon footprint through smart materials selection and sustainable design practices.', 'Note: IQOS ILUMA is designed to be used only with TEREA SMARTCORE STICKS.', 'IQOS ILUMA and TEREA SMARTCORE STICKS must not be used with previous generations of IQOS, as this may damage the device.', 'As TEREA SMARTCORE STICKS contain a sharp metal part that can cause serious injury if swallowed, they must be kept out of reach of children and pets, and must not be ingested or disassembled.', 'Air-flow chamber that ensures that just the right amount of aerosol passes

'Reduce post-consumer waste Extending smoke-free product life cycle We strive for our products to last and increasingly aim to refresh and repair them so they stay in use as long as possible.', 'Achieving this starts with imposing high standards of quality and reliability (read more here) and extends to proper care, steps to refresh, repair, and refurbish devices, and recycling.', 'In other words, we are evolving from a collection-for-recycling model to a collection-for-recovery one.', 'This means we need to develop criteria to facilitate the product triage needed to expand our refresh and repair capabilities.', 'In this context, we have identified the following key dimensions to be addressed: (1) collection and triage of devices, distinguishing between those to be recycled and those to be refreshed or repaired; (2) refresh and repair capabilities that meet quality requirements; and (3) re-marketing of products.', 'The first two pillars are highly interdependent, as the criteria and procedures for device triage are linked to the extent of our refresh and repair capabilities.', 'As these capabilities will strengthen over time, the triage model will also evolve, allowing a greater proportion of devices to be refreshed or repaired.', 'We use life-cycle analysis (LCA) to assess the carbon footprint of our products, from tobacco sourcing to device end-of-life impacts.', 'This analysis applies to IQOS devices, heated tobacco units, and packaging.', 'In 2020, we finalized the results for our new heat-not-burn product, IQOS ILUMA, which we launched in two markets in 2021.', 'IQOS ILUMA represents a new generation of products and therefore sets a new baseline for carbon footprint.', 'It comes with new induction technology and quality improvements that address consumer pain points and aims to prolong the product life cycle, hence reducing its environmental impact over time despite a slightly higher carbon footprint than previous device generations that were based on blade technology.', 'We strongly believe that IQOS ILUMA will be a key driver to support our smoke-free future objectives.', 'We aim to drive continuous improvement in future product generations.', 'To this end, we have designed assessment guidelines to further embed sustainability (including carbon-related) considerations in the early stages of the development process.', 'We will start applying those guidelines as part of our roadmap toward eco-design certification.', 'Preserve through proper device care The first pillar of our work is device life extension through better care.', 'We strive to help users of smoke-free electronic products look after their devices so they serve them\\u202flonger and to encourage them to return the devices to us after use so we can give them new life via a refresh, repair, or recycling.', 'We seek to minimize consumer pain points with\\u202fsimple tips pertaining to regular device cleaning at home or professional\\u202fcleaning in our boutiques, software updates, and\\u202fproper charging.', 'These simple actions help\\u202freduce the number of devices ending up\\u202fas waste.', 'Building on this work, we are leveraging processes and tools in our sales channels (e.g., our stores, e-commerce websites, and IQOS coaches) to prolong the life of our devices and avoid e-waste through appropriate device care.', 'These efforts include avoiding unnecessary product replacements through proper device diagnosis and streamlined procedures for returns, warranties, and loyalty programs.', 'In 2021, we maintained or expanded several service-based solutions aimed at extending product lifetimes through device optimization and maintenance.', 'Eco-design certification Product eco-design certification can drive performance by raising the standards to pursue and provide comprehensive information to consumers, enabling them to make more sustainable product choices when switching from cigarettes to smoke-free products.', 'In 2021, we conducted an in-depth assessment of certification schemes and established a roadmap to meet our ambition of having all smoke-free electronic devices launched as of the end of 2025 eco-design certified.', 'We also established a dedicated committee composed of senior leaders from our Product team.', 'Smoke-free products—and heated tobacco products, in particular—are a relatively new product category.', 'As such, they typically are not covered by existing eco-design certification standards.', 'Accordingly, we are implementing a two-pronged approach.', 'Ultimately, we seek to develop and implement new category standards as necessary to achieve our certification goal.', 'In the shorter term, we are working to identify other ways to publicly disclose the sustainability performance of our products through structured disclosure programs.', 'A prerequisite to achieving our product eco-design certification ambition is to continue cascading our criteria for sustainable design and integrating eco-design certification requirements into our materials selection and development processes.', 'This graphic is an internal assessment based on data compiled

program helps to recycle materials back into the economy.', 'Our CIRCLE program provides centralized hubs that inspect, process, and separate materials from our electronic devices for recycling.', 'Our CIRCLE hubs in Hungary and Japan continued to drive excellence in e-waste management in 2021.', 'The recycling rate of our products in these two hubs combined stood at 86 percent for the year (78 percent recycling and 8 percent incineration with energy recovery).', 'We also continued expanding CIRCLE hub coverage, bringing the total to 14 markets covered by our CIRCLE program at the end of 2021.', 'This allowed us to achieve 63 percent market volume coverage globally (up from 48 percent in 2020) and progress toward our target of 100 percent by 2025.', 'Considering regulatory restrictions related to e-waste transportation, we cannot fully leverage our recycling standards at the centralized hubs.', 'Hence, we will further assess potential CIRCLE capabilities that may be implemented locally yet governed by central standards.', 'In 2022, we plan to define a set of consistent criteria to account for local solutions under our CIRCLE program.', 'Nonetheless, our key objective remains to drive centralization of our efforts, as we believe this approach can bring several benefits, including economies of scale, regional investment, illicit trade prevention, and quality enhancements (accelerating design and manufacturing improvements).', 'For instance, we released a global campaign and made a mobile application available for IQOS users in 18 markets that provides tips on how to use and clean the devices, as well as basic troubleshooting instructions.', 'We also installed firmware upgrade retail solutions in all markets in which our smoke- free products are sold to make device maintenance more convenient and support product life-cycle extension.', 'Overall, the combination of device quality improvements and consumer-facing efforts contributed to reducing our device return rate by around one-third in the past two years.', 'Promote device second life: refresh and repair We strive to establish commercially viable programs that offer a second life to devices and cycle them back into the economy.', 'We are in the early stages of moving from a collection-for-recycling model to a collection-for- recovery model, which will help us attain meaningful circularity.', 'We took steps in 2021 to prepare and scale up capabilities at our CIRCLE hubs to enable the processing of devices for a second life.', 'To guide us in this journey, we have set an ambitious target to refresh or repair at least one million smoke- free electronic devices by 2025 (cumulative since 2021).', 'Key prerequisites of a successful second- life strategy include the ability to collect and sort devices, distinguishing between those to be recycled and those to be recovered, and to repair devices according to quality and safety standards.', 'We remain committed to maintaining a recycling rate of above 80 percent for our smoke-free devices in our CIRCLE hubs while gradually expanding coverage.', 'As new hubs and products are introduced, we will continue to improve our recycling capabilities.', 'We aim to increase our effective recycling rate from 53 percent in 2021 to our target of 80 percent by 2025.1 Accessories As we progress with device recycling, we are exploring possibilities to close the loop by reusing materials to produce new accessories for our products.', 'For instance, we have designed a collection of IQOS 3 accessories made out of IQOS devices recycled in our CIRCLE hubs.', 'The collection consists of four SKUs and will be launched in three markets as a pilot.', 'We expect this initiative to further encourage consumers to play an active role in reducing post-consumer waste.', 'In 2021, to build a foundation for our device second-life program, we conducted pilots to test the IQOS refreshed value proposition in several markets across Europe and Asia.', 'In five of these markets (Austria, Germany, Japan, Switzerland, and U.K.), we collected and refreshed devices returned by consumers at the end of the device trial period (our lending program allows adult smokers to test the product for a maximum of 30 days).', 'Product refreshes do not involve replacing internal components but, rather, swapping in new external components when damaged, deep cleaning, and repackaging.', 'We worked with our partners at our CIRCLE hubs in Hungary and Japan to apply triage criteria.', 'We determined whether each component merited recovery or recycling, primarily focusing on the IQOS chargers and holders.', 'We also considered user documents, packaging boxes, and charging cables.', 'We refreshed around 62,000 devices during this pilot phase and resold them in eight markets (the five pilot countries plus Malaysia, New Zealand, and Portugal), either as a pilot or as part of the standard product assortment.', 'Overall, the results of the pilots, along with consumers’ direct feedback and research insights, confirmed the validity and potential of the second-life concept and encouraged us to continue our journey toward circularity.', 'The refreshed products were sold at lower price points than new ones and demonstrated high consumer satisfaction.', 'Also in 2021, we piloted an extended collection of used devices from consumers in two markets: the Czech Republic and Slovakia.', 'Our take-back program has been designed to accept returns of any used devices consumers no longer want.', 'We deployed dedicated collection boxes across our IQOS retail network, covering 56 shops in the Czech Republic and 19 in Slovakia.', 'We then sent the returned electronic devices to the CIRCLE hub in Hungary for recycling.', 'The initiative has been met with a very positive reaction from consumers.', 'One of our next priorities will be to expand the collection of used devices via other consumer programs and increase their processing for a second life.', 'We plan to further expand the program’s geographic coverage and will continue to increase our refresh and repair capabilities.', '“ Considering that we launched IQOS in the Czech and Slovak markets back in 2017, naturally some of our customers possess devices that have reached the end of their technological life cycle.', 'We would like to motivate them not to throw the electronic equipment in mixed waste, but rather to return it to us so that we can take care of it on their behalf.” Marta Barbara Keszczyk Head of Direct Retail, PM Czech Republic and Slovakia 1 The effective recycling rate is calculated based on the proportion of devices covered by the CIRCLE program multiplied by the actual recycling rate of devices at the CIRCLE hubs in Hungary and Japan (weighted average), to which we add the theoretical recycling rate of the Russian CIRCLE hub, established in late 2021, multiplied by the CIRCLE program coverage of the Russian market.', 'Philip Morris International – Integrated Report 2021 112 113 Overview Strategy Operational impact Product impact Fundamentals Reporting and performance', 'Reduce post-consumer waste Reducing and improving packaging Our approach to packaging contributes significantly to our efforts to preserve and protect the planet’s resources.', 'We use packaging for all our products, including cigarettes and smoke-free electronic devices, consumables, and accessories.', 'Our approach We aim to develop solutions that minimize packaging materials and improve their circularity without compromising protection and convenience.', 'We are driving our approach through ambitious commitments.', 'We aim to achieve: • 100 percent recyclable inner liners by the end of 20221 • 100 percent of packaging made with recyclable materials by 2025 • 95 percent of packaging materials made from renewable sources by 2025 • 15 percent reduction in packaging weight by 2025 (versus 2018 baseline) Reduce packaging Our first ambition is to decrease the volume of materials used in our packaging.', 'We focus first on board, the primary material used in our packaging.', 'In 2021, we estimate that over 70 percent of the volume of board and paper we sourced for our packaging came from suppliers with Chain of Custody (CoC) certified according to the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC), Programme for the Endorsement of Forest Certification (PEFC), or Sustainable Forest Initiative (SFI) standards.', 'Working with our major suppliers, we continued to roll out the replacement of the packaging board used in our HTU and cigarette packaging with a 10 percent lighter alternative.', 'By the end of 2021, we completed some of the projects within our board weight reduction program, enabling us to save an estimated 8,500 tons of board without compromising pack quality.', 'To deliver on these commitments, we employ a twofold strategy: 1.', 'Reduce packaging: We aim to eliminate unnecessary packaging, in particular plastic packaging, and to implement solutions allowing us to reduce the amount of materials used.', '2.', 'Improve circularity: To prevent the depletion of finite resources, we seek to increase the recyclability of our packaging and to reduce the use of materials made from non-renewable sources, in particular aluminum and non- recyclable plastics.', 'Fundamental to our efforts is integrating circularity considerations into the sourcing of renewable materials, minimizing packaging, and reducing end-of- life implications.', 'In the design stage, for instance, we prioritize the use of recyclable mono-materials and the reduction of the void inside the packaging to optimize transportation, both of which reduce the product’s carbon footprint.', 'To ensure circularity, the packaging should be easily recycled by consumers.', 'This requires that a recycling infrastructure be available for the materials selected in markets across the globe.', 'Our teams in the Consumer, Product, and Procurement departments work together to promote the various elements of circular packaging design.', '1 For all markets where such a change is possible according to local regulatory compliance.', 'Meanwhile, we achieved significant progress in the packaging used for our smoke-free devices and accessories.', 'In 2021, we launched a new IQOS ILUMA packaging without any plastic shrink film or plastic window, leading to a 9 ton reduction in plastics used.', 'Packaging materials efficiency was also improved, with new packaging formats being 40 percent lighter and 20 percent smaller, representing 43 tons of fiber-based packaging reduction while keeping equivalent product protection.', 'Those improvements have significantly reduced packaging carbon emissions for IQOS ILUMA.', 'We also worked to facilitate the proper disposal of packaging by consumers.', 'For instance, we have stopped using magnets in our device boxes and are taking steps to replace plastic laminated board to achieve complete recyclability of our devices and accessories packaging in the paper stream.', 'Overall, between 2018 and 2021, we reduced our total packaging

the COVID-19 outbreak in 2020, the increase in 2021 reflects our continued business transformation, as well as broader shifts in workforce trends and preferences.', 'In 2021, we hired close to 8,400 employees worldwide and filled almost one out of five open positions with internal candidates.', 'Our internal careers market provides current employees with transparency and easy access to opportunities.', 'It helps us to mobilize our diverse talents across the organization and support the career growth and satisfaction of our employees.', 'Achieving a high retention rate starts with effective onboarding processes for new employees.', 'In 2021, we continued to improve these processes and our employee induction program, which includes training related to the business, how we create value, our products, and our approach to sustainable development.', 'We leverage a holistic approach to employee listening to capture the needs and expectations of our workforce during different moments in their career, such as onboarding, a change of position, or a promotion.', 'This helps us develop focused interventions.', 'We plan to conduct a living wage assessment at least every two years and initiate actions as necessary to ensure we continue to meet our global living wage commitment to our employees.', 'Equal pay for equal work At PMI, we understand equal pay for equal work as the baseline standard for gender equality, and we have committed to regularly assess and certify that our pay practices match our good intentions.', 'In 2019, we became the first company to earn global certification from the nonprofit EQUAL-SALARY Foundation following an intensive quantitative and qualitative review of our pay and related practices.', 'This independent certification verifies that PMI pays men and women equally for equal work everywhere the company operates.', 'The original certification was valid until April 2022 and we are proud to confirm the re-certification, valid until March 2025.', 'As part of the process, we conducted a quantitative compensation assessment in 2021 that confirmed that men and women are paid equally for equal work.', 'Moreover, auditors from PricewaterhouseCoopers validated additional qualitative aspects regarding equality such as the commitment of top management to gender equality and equal pay, the objectivity of our P&C pay policies and practices, transparent communication, and employee perceptions on these matters.', 'Equal pay for equal work is a first step in recognizing the value of women’s work and their contributions to society.', 'With this foundation in place, we are now working to close our broader gender pay gap (the average pay for women versus the average pay for men), including by achieving a better gender balance at senior levels of the company (learn more here).', 'For instance, in 2021, we developed a playbook to guide managers throughout their journey, from hiring to managing growth and development, supporting their teams, resolving issues, and recognizing superior performance.', 'Equipping supervisors with such knowledge and tools is essential to providing meaningful employee experiences, fostering engagement, and boosting PMI’s attractiveness as an employer.', 'Anticipating the needs of tomorrow As PMI evolves and progresses towards its purpose, understanding and sourcing critical, strategic, future-fit skills is essential.', 'Strategic workforce planning enables us to proactively manage and deploy talent, address potential risks, and capitalize on opportunities to better manage talents in the longer term.', 'In 2021, we took steps to enhance our shorter- term operational workforce planning.', 'We piloted an internal online platform that allows employees to join projects based on their skills, interests, and availability.', 'We want to help employees grow by applying their skills or learning new ones in contexts different from their day-to-day jobs.', 'The platform was made available to around 1,200 employees in our Commercial function across 35 markets in 2021.', '1 In 2021, we updated our methodology to expand scope and cover employees on long-term leave (over 30 calendar days); we have restated historical data accordingly.', 'Performance and career development Performance and career development reviews support the personal growth of employees and contribute to skills management and the development of human capital within PMI.', 'Philip Morris International – Integrated Report 2021 124 125 Overview Strategy Operational impact Product impact Fundamentals Reporting and performance', 'Foster an empowered and inclusive workplace Following pilots in 2020, we expanded our new performance management program in 2021 to cover all managerial positions worldwide (representing more than 11,000 people), as well as around 2,000 additional employees in non-managerial positions.', 'This new program is aligned with our quickly evolving environment and ways of working—particularly as we increasingly work in project-based, cross- functional, multidisciplinary, and virtual teams.', 'The approach is built on three fundamental priorities: clear objectives for all employees derived from the company strategy, continuous feedback from multiple sources, and the incorporation of the “how” element in line with PMI’s leadership model.', 'This new approach provides a more holistic picture of the value and impact each employee brings.', 'Employees in non-managerial positions, who were not covered with the new performance management approach in 2021, continued to undergo a performance management approach that leverages the PMI leadership model and sets out a clear methodology for objective setting.', 'Overall, more than 92 percent of our employees were covered by formal performance reviews in 2021.1 In addition to the new performance management program, we improved our talent review process in 2021 to ensure employees’ careers and development are discussed in a structured, objective, and fair manner.', 'Continuous employee learning and development We seek to provide employees access to opportunities to develop their skills and careers.', 'Our global approach to learning takes into account what employees need and when they need it.', 'Our learning culture aims to foster a skilled and confident workforce by giving people the tools they need to perform to the best of their abilities within their current roles and to develop their potential to be successful in future roles.', 'Digital learning In 2021, with many office-based employees continuing to work remotely, whether full- or part-time, we focused on strengthening our digital learning capabilities and offerings.', 'We also launched two new global pathways for key talent groups: • Women empowerment: The first program, developed with our Inclusion & Diversity team, was for high-potential female employees.', 'This initiative recognized that women often operate within systems built on masculine norms—systems that are still adapting to be fully inclusive.', 'With a focus on personal growth and development, the initiative was designed to provide participants strategies and tactics with which to navigate common barriers, create a sense of community and belonging, and focus on what is truly important to them in their lives and careers.', 'More than 50 senior female leaders participated in the six-month program, which incorporated virtual classrooms, one-to-one sessions with an external coach, and group activities.', '• Leadership succession: The second program was designed to help us build a succession pipeline for our Company Management.', 'Participants in the nine-month program first established individual development plans.', 'Through trainings by external partners such as INSEAD and Duke Corporate Education, as well as individual and group coaching, the program helped participants bolster the critical business and leadership capabilities they will need to be ready to step into a senior management role when the right position is identified for them.', 'In addition to the core elements offered by our external partners, participants were able to select from a number of elective elements targeting their areas of expertise and interest.', 'Improving equity: providing access to opportunities that boost employability PMI is changing, and so is the world of work.', 'New technologies are disrupting the business environment, driving a need for new skills and capabilities.', 'Continuous upskilling and reskilling is essential to ensure employees thrive and, as a result, improve the company’s performance.', 'We seek to empower our employees to take ownership of their career development by focusing on equity, granting access, and democratizing training by offering a range of voluntary learning opportunities.', 'Our training is delivered through our global e-learning platform, FUSE.', 'By the end of 2021, around 75 percent of our workforce had access to and were actively engaged on the platform.', 'Digital training programs available on FUSE range from foundational knowledge of our products, science, and transformation to effective leadership, well-being management, and IT and digital capability development.', 'Our Global Learning Network, made up of close to 800 employee volunteers representing a broad range of countries, functions, and seniority levels, plays a vital role in informing the design and delivery of our learning products.', 'Working closely with these team members allows us to stay learner-focused in our approach and truly understand what our employees need and value.', 'Targeted programs We also create targeted programs to help employees acquire and develop the skills that will allow us to meet our strategic targets.', 'Every PMI employee owns their development, and we know that not everyone learns in the same way or at the same pace.', 'Consequently, our portfolio of learning products is flexible, incorporating online self-paced resources, virtual classrooms, and in-person sessions.', 'Some of the new learning solutions we provided to our people in 2021 include: • Consumer centricity: PMI’s first global learning game, Bee Wow, is a custom, data-driven training solution focused on building consumer-centric behaviors, knowledge, and skills.', 'Since its global launch in October 2021, more than 1,500 employees have completed the game, gaining knowledge and confidence in the training subjects and implementing this learning into their day-to-day work.', 'The program continues to achieve results and receive external recognition, including a silver medal for “Best Use of Games or Simulations” at the 2021 Brandon Hall Group Excellence Awards in Learning.', 'Both employee and managerial feedback demonstrate that the training tool is effective, efficient, and well-received.', '• Leadership development: At PMI, every employee is considered a leader, and it is vital that we provide the necessary support to enable everyone to grow, develop, and contribute to the success of the company.', 'We have invested in leadership development offerings over the past several years and have put in place solutions covering critical areas such as leading change, first-level management skills, and resilience.', 'For example, our digital language learning program is available to all employees worldwide.', 'As of the end of 2021, 3,561 employees were actively learning or perfecting a new language, and the company experienced a significant uplift in language proficiency.', 'Meanwhile, our Operations function continued to expand its voluntary lifelong learning program.', 'Designed to improve equity, be inclusive, and enable growth, the program empowers employees to choose the skills they want to learn to shape their careers in the direction of their choice.', 'There are no prerequisites for signing up for a course, and PMI offers bridge courses so employees at all levels can enter the program where they fit and progress toward higher levels and certifications.', 'The online certification programs vary in length and difficulty, ranging from a few hours up to 18 months, with some counting toward a master’s or other advanced degree at a designated partner university.', 'In 2021, we rolled out access to all employees in our Operations function (totaling around 21,000 people), as well as to specific additional functions and geographies.', 'By year-end, the program counted around 3,000 active learners across 50 countries, who logged an estimated 38,000 training hours during 2021 and obtained 1,680 academic certifications.', 'More broadly, in 2021, we started identifying and mapping potential training and education areas in which to invest to meet the emerging demands of our company and the job market.', 'We will fine-tune and expand this preliminary work in 2022, laying the groundwork for a more holistic approach to lifelong learning.', 'This will guide our progress toward our newly introduced aspiration to provide 70 percent of our employees with structured lifelong learning offers by 2025.', 'Listening to our employees Listening to our employees is an essential part of our strategy and key to achieve our purpose.', 'We conduct an extended company-wide employee survey annually, which we complement with regular pulse checks throughout the year.', 'The results of our annual survey in 2021—to which 44,089 employees responded—showed an overall improvement compared with 2020.', 'With an employee Net Promoter Score (eNPS) of 35, we achieved for the second consecutive year our target of maintaining a minimum eNPS of 30, and we are 10 points above the global benchmark provided by our external partner Karian and Box.', '1 Based on a total of 55,276 employees maintained in PMI’s central HR system.', 'Philip Morris International – Integrated Report 2021 126 127 Overview Strategy Operational impact Product impact Fundamentals Reporting and performance', 'Foster an empowered and inclusive workplace The results underscore that employees feel highly confident in the success of PMI’s transformation and inspired by the company’s purpose.', 'Compared with 2020, the survey data showed strong improvement in collaboration between markets and functions, and in line managers asking for feedback.', 'Areas on which we need to focus further are employee reward and recognition, as well as career opportunities.', 'Moreover, while on a positive trend, our employee well-being rating—collected as part of a separate survey—shed light on the need to promote and protect our employees’ mental health and well-being (read more here).', 'We examine our engagement scores through a range of filters, including function, location, tenure, age, gender, grade, and working arrangements during COVID-19.', 'This segmentation helps us to shape action plans more precisely.', 'When we analyze results by gender, for instance, we see the engagement results improved compared with the previous year for both women (31 to 32 points) and men (33 to 36 points), but the gap between the genders has increased.', 'As with previous surveys, we will use the 2021 results to deliver concrete improvements across the company, which we will disclose in our next report.', 'Protecting the health and safety of our employees Keeping people safe is a moral and business imperative.', 'We are committed to providing a safe and healthy workplace that promotes a culture of empowerment.', 'We have embedded clear methodologies, procedures, and robust controls in our factories, offices, and fleet aimed at ensuring that our employees and others on-site stay safe.', 'The health and safety of employees and contractors is covered by our management systems, which are based on recognized guidelines and standards, including ISO 45001, and assessed and audited internally and externally.', 'These systems enable us to monitor health and safety performance across all our manufacturing facilities, offices, and in our fleet.', 'We routinely update our standards and train our staff to ensure teams understand and align with the requirements.', 'Maintaining our safety-first position in the era of COVID-19 We have long prioritized safety to protect our employees, contracted employees, and contractors in our premises.', 'In response to the continued COVID-19 pandemic, we maintained, reinforced, or adjusted various protective measures across our sites and activities throughout 2021.', 'As the pandemic evolved throughout the year in different geographies, our recovery plan focused on mitigating and managing risk.', 'We took a conservative and precautionary stance, with clear criteria to help our business units in different parts of the world identify when to take steps toward a gradual return to the workplace, as well as when to reimplement restrictive measures, as warranted.', 'Manufacturing of the future To thrive over the long term, we have embarked on a journey toward “manufacturing of the future.” Our North Star: an agile, smart factory with an end-to-end operations ecosystem, advanced digital technology, upskilled teams, and best-in-class safety, quality, and sustainability performances.', 'We have set this vision and defined steps across all our manufacturing sites to guide our progress.', 'People capability development provides the foundation for this journey.', 'We want to support our factory workers in shifting from reactive tasks to proactive interventions by increasing their skill levels and supporting them with effective technology.', 'Along the way, we are deploying extensive learning opportunities (with both internal and external certifications) to help ensure our people are future-fit and highly employable.', 'Although we anticipate that this journey typically will take six or seven years to achieve, the pace is specific to each manufacturing site and guided by the pillars of our Open+ program, our lean methodology aimed at eliminating losses and building the necessary capabilities to deliver sustainable results.', 'Promoting employee volunteering PMI has a long-standing commitment to support the communities where our employees live and work and where we source tobacco.', 'This support is provided in the form of monetary contributions and in-kind donations (see the list of our 2021 social contributions here), as well as volunteer work by our employees.', 'Beyond supporting local communities, volunteering can motivate and enrich the lives of our employees, help them develop new skills, and enhance their perception of PMI as a great place to work.', 'At the end of 2020, we established global guidelines to further encourage those who would like to contribute their time, energy, and efforts to improving life in their communities.', 'Every PMI employee is eligible to take two days per year of paid leave for volunteering activities.', 'Moreover, the company commits to match—with up to five additional paid leave days—any additional volunteer work employees choose to do on their own time.', 'This is in addition to the existing customary practice of giving employees paid leave for participating in initiatives organized by the company during traditional work hours.', 'In 2021, amid the COVID-19 pandemic, we piloted the guidelines without broadly promoting them, and only a limited number of employees took part in the program.', 'In 2022, we plan to significantly increase awareness of the program among employees to empower them and assimilate volunteer work as a regular practice.', 'Our efforts to promote volunteer work are complemented by our employee-driven philanthropy “Projects with a Heart.” It is a global grassroots movement established and run by employees and endorsed by PMI.', 'The internal platform connects

supervision of PMI but employed by a temporary employment agency (we had around 7,000 contracted employees on average per month in 2021), and contractors when on PMI premises.', 'Contractors are workers who are employed by or work on behalf of a third-party company contracted by PMI but who remain under the direct supervision of their employer.', 'Typically, such workers are involved in specific projects (e.g., machine installation or construction), facility management (e.g., building maintenance), logistics (e.g., transportation or administration), or services (e.g., canteens or medical centers on PMI premises).', 'In 2021, across our factories, offices, warehouses, and fleet, our integrated total recordable incidents rate (iTRIR) was 0.09 (2020: 0.12), which breaks down into 0.09 (2020: 0.11) for employees and contracted employees and 0.10 (2020: 0.16) for contractors.', 'We are proud of the progress made to date and remain committed to maintaining an iTRIR below 0.30 in a sustainable manner.', 'During the year, our lost time incident rate (LTIR) for employees, contracted employees, and contractors was 0.05 (2020: 0.08).', 'More specifically, it was 0.06 (2020: 0.07) for employees and contracted employees and 0.05 (2020: 0.12) for contractors.', 'We do not set targets on lost time incidents as we wish to handle every incident with the same level of importance, quality of analysis, and mitigating action regardless of whether the incidents result in lost time.', 'We use behavioral observation systems (BOS) in our factories to instill a culture in which everyone involves themselves in openness, care, observation, and behavior reinforcement.', 'We advance this culture through communication with employees and safety alerts or notice boards.', 'Every person’s contribution counts—a fact we recognize through awards and other means of acknowledgment.', 'Through BOS, we are further embedding safety into the organization’s DNA in a planned, structured, and standardized way.', 'Embedding a safety culture We conduct annual assessments and employee surveys to evaluate our sites’ safety culture level and identify opportunities for improvement.', 'Every year, we invite all employees in our manufacturing sites to participate in a survey and provide feedback on a wide range of cultural and behavioral issues related to the workplace environment and health and safety.', 'The results serve as a direct effectiveness check of measures put in place as a result of our regular culture assessments.', 'These assessments are performed at our manufacturing sites each year by a group of factory representatives from all levels of their local organizations.', 'Our ambition in our factories is to create an interdependent sustainability culture in which responsibility for health and safety and the workplace environment is owned by highly skilled individuals and autonomous teams and in which sustainability is demonstrated and perceived as a core company value.', 'The combined survey and assessment results provide our factories a detailed overview of their progress toward that goal.', 'Fleet We seek to protect our employees by providing safe vehicles and driver safety awareness programs to achieve zero preventable fleet safety accidents.', 'Our target is to reduce high-severity collisions, with an ongoing goal of eliminating fatal accidents completely.', 'A dedicated team—led by our Director, Security and Market Safety in coordination with local fleet safety committees—manages security and market safety.', 'This team develops and deploys programs and training courses, fosters engagement at the country level, and uses monitoring systems and performance indicators to evaluate progress.', 'PMI’s fleet safety management system

in-depth root cause analysis, and we apply the same thorough approach to all incidents involving contractors in our manufacturing facilities.', 'In 2021, we reviewed our global requirements for fleet safety and issued a global policy governing the management of our fleet vehicles, along with operational guidelines.', 'The goal of our fleet safety management program is to achieve zero preventable accidents and to protect employees and other road users, the company’s assets and reputation, and the environment.', 'The challenges we face in delivering safe working conditions relate to road conditions, law enforcement, and driving culture.', 'Distracted driving (e.g., using a mobile phone or eating while driving) is the leading cause of vehicle collisions (research shows that people who drive while using their phones are far more likely to be involved in a crash, and this risk multiplies for people who text while driving).', 'To improve driving behavior, we leverage awareness raising

2021.', 'Although we continue to reduce collisions, it is to our deep regret that we endured road traffic fatalities in 2021, involving one PMI employee and two members of the public.', 'The accidents occurred in two countries in Asia and involved challenging circumstances related to basic motorbike defensive-driving techniques, such as traffic anticipation, maintenance of safe speeds for the road conditions, and proper use of personal protective equipment such as helmets.', 'Lessons learned from the investigations include the necessity for motorbike-specific defensive-driving training, along with the continued deployment of our robust fleet safety management program.', 'Advancing gender equality and improving equity to foster inclusion requires us to better understand and tackle

globally in 2022.', 'We are committed to inspiring men to become aware of unconscious bias, understand male privilege, and leverage their power and position to advocate for tangible change that can advance equity and equality.', 'As part of this process, we have begun communicating about the importance of allyship in the workplace through our internal social media channels, with the aim of sparking a global conversation.', 'We also focus our efforts on specific business functions.', 'For example, we initiated a program to identify the causes of low female representation at different levels of the sales organization and tailor initiatives to address them.', 'Our Chief Diversity Officer puts special attention on hearing the voices of frontline female employees worldwide to

build and accelerate the development of high potential Asian talents.', 'A total of 64 employees in management positions participated in the first year rollout.', 'The program follows a blended learning approach from the Duke Corporate Education faculty, external experts, and PMI leaders to sharpen the agility and management capabilities of the participants.', 'It offers course learnings and real business challenges that will equip them with strategic and organizational skills that will be instrumental for their readiness to take on leadership roles in Asia and globally across PMI.', 'Furthermore, we believe it is necessary to rebalance local and foreign representation within market executive teams.', 'While it remains important to offer employees the opportunity to relocate for their development and for talent transfers to accelerate progress in a market, we are clear that an inclusive and consumer-centric approach is paramount for our success in any given country.', 'Accordingly, we have set a new ambition to develop local talent for leadership positions, and we aim to achieve a minimum local representation of 60 percent in at least 80 percent of our markets.', 'In 2022, we intend to establish our baseline and design and implement a multiyear plan.', 'Building a culture that promotes and protects inclusion We can put in place programs to increase diversity, but if we fail to welcome, protect, and empower diverse people and their voices to thrive, that sought after diversity will not be sustainable.', 'Inclusion means ensuring all people feel they belong and are an integral part of our company.', 'If diversity is marginalized, and not properly integrated, employees are not only less likely to perform at their highest level, but also unlikely to be retained.', 'Only a truly inclusive culture can ensure we benefit fully from the value diversity can bring to our organization.', 'Measuring inclusion We understand that inclusion unlocks the potential of diversity.', 'However, unlike diversity, inclusion can be challenging to measure and to track over time.', 'In 2021, we sought to capture employee sentiment on inclusion, leveraging our global employee listening survey.', 'We introduced a set of six new questions derived from research by Gartner.', 'The responses identified the following critical dimensions of inclusion: fair treatment, integrating differences, decision-making, psychological safety, trust, belonging, and diversity.', 'We averaged the scores attributed to those six questions to build an “inclusion index.” At 76 percent, the index showed an overall high perception of inclusion within PMI.', 'Around half of the participants responded positively to all questions, and the experience of inclusion by women versus men did not highlight any significant discrepancy (inclusion index of 74 percent for women and 78 percent for men).', 'However, the exercise shed light on notable differences regarding individual questions.', 'For instance, questions linked to “integrating differences” and “decision-making” scored high, while lower scores were accorded to questions linked to “fair treatment” and “psychological safety.” Also, the gap between women and men widened on questions related to psychological safety and fair rewards.', 'The findings also revealed a lower experience of inclusion among those employees who identify as belonging to an underrepresented group.', 'This first attempt to measure inclusion helped us set a baseline of employees’ feelings and to design programs tailor-made for every function according to their results.', 'Following a year when inclusion and diversity efforts moved center stage amid the global pandemic, the absence of a single authoritative approach to effectively measuring inclusion in business has become even more apparent.', 'To address the issue, on International Women’s Day (March 8, 2021), we launched Inclusive Future, a year-long research and convening project to advance the discourse and practices surrounding inclusivity.', 'In partnership with the International Institute for Management Development (IMD) in Switzerland, we are working to devise effective and timely ways to promote inclusive cultures within organizations of all types.', 'Inclusive Future will take stock of best practices and established thought leadership and explore how recent events and the current climate can inform the evolution of more effective approaches for driving inclusive cultures.', 'We aim to better understand, develop, and advance the discourse surrounding inclusion today and into the future, aiming to explore more sophisticated ways to measure it going forward.', 'Read more here.', 'Encouraging employees to take an active role We strongly believe that promoting inclusion is a collective responsibility and that education and awareness-raising is an essential first step.', 'In 2021, we continued to promote our global employee resource groups (ERG) on women, race, ethnicity, and LGBTQ+ inclusion, and we launched a new ERG focused on disability.', 'Our employee-led groups focus on particular dimensions of diversity and are intended to provide a platform for building a sense of belonging and sparking conversations.', 'They organize events, provide mentoring opportunities, and host conversations in which employees are encouraged to share their diverse perspectives and experiences to better understand and support one another.', 'Every ERG is open to all at PMI, led by a committee of volunteers, sponsored by a member of Company Management, and supported by an external subject matter expert partnership.', 'In 2021, around 10,000 employees participated in one or more of our ERG programs and events.', 'PMI’s employee resource groups: • STRIPES convenes employees around gender identity and provides a formalized structure and global strategy for the local LGBTQ+ networks present in 29 markets.', 'In 2021, we partnered with Stonewall and began reviewing together some of our internal policies to ensure they are representative and inclusive of LGBTQ+ colleagues.', 'We also partnered with Accenture to start running an intercompany training focused on allyship.', '• EMBRACE aims to champion racial, ethnic, and cultural equality by raising awareness and understanding of the challenges faced by underrepresented groups.', 'In 2021, we partnered with the Racial Justice Institute to advance PMI’s efforts in this area through training, workshops, and engagement opportunities focused on racial justice, allyship, and advocacy.', 'As of year-end, we had four local race and ethnicity ERG chapters in addition to our global ERG.', '• WIN (Women’s Inspiration Network) seeks to provide a supportive place to inspire and empower women to advance their skills, expand their network and unlock their full potential.', 'In 2021, WIN organized three global events with external speakers and started weekly virtual coffee corners, providing a networking opportunity to women (and men) of PMI.', 'Currently, more than 40 markets have access to local WIN chapters.', '• ABLE, launched in 2021, aims to foster a more

employees could provide feedback and input into the company’s broad strategic plans and activities for the year ahead in alignment with the global inclusion and diversity (I&D) multiyear strategy.', 'In 2021, PMI also launched an inclusive language toolkit in collaboration with its global ERGs to provide guidance on terms and expressions to use and avoid when engaging in internal discussions.', 'Raising awareness and knowledge In 2021, we broadcast our first global I&D conference.', 'Our Chief Diversity Officer hosted two sessions, available to all employees, and introduced the global I&D multiyear strategy.', 'Our Chief Consumer Officer explained the IQOS inclusive brand principles, and we announced the introduction of global ERGs.', 'As part of our ongoing effort to gather diverse input for our inclusion and diversity strategy and programs, we created an internal employee group (I&D Soundboard), which meets regularly to give input and feedback to the I&D team.', 'We also implemented monthly global I&D Office Hours.', 'These sessions offer a casual and safe setting in which employees worldwide can openly raise questions or topics with our Chief Diversity Officer and the global I&D team and share their thoughts with participants from different teams and business areas.', 'We also continued our efforts to build a culture of inclusive behaviors through our I&D learning curriculum.', 'We support teams in addressing challenges through a set of e-learning experiences in which employees learn about the origins of bias and the various ways it shows up in organizations.', 'Participants receive practical tools and techniques to combat prejudice and preconceived notions.', 'Promoting mental health and well-being Maintaining a happy and healthy workplace is key to employee engagement, productivity, satisfaction, and retention.', 'We understand that when people feel good, they are likely to contribute more to their families, their work, and society.', 'Our aspiration is to promote an environment that supports employee well-being as an enabler of professional and personal fulfillment, sustainable high performance, and business results.', 'The extraordinary circumstances of the COVID-19 pandemic further precipitated focused attention on this area.', 'Building a holistic approach to well-being While PMI has provided benefits centered on health and well-being for some time, these were primarily focused on reactive support or led by local market teams without a unifying global framework.', 'In 2021, we created a global framework and established an integrated and data-driven roadmap of priority actions to support the holistic well- being of employees across the company.', 'Our work was supported by insights gathered through our employee listening surveys, benchmarks of best-in- class practices, and the help of external experts.', 'Under our holistic framework, well-being incorporates physical needs, psychological needs, and self-fulfillment.', 'Our approach is based on the following principles: 1.', 'People’s energy is a critical enabler of performance 2.', 'We take accountability as an organization to support employee well-being 3.', 'We expect employees to take individual accountability for their well-being as well 4.', 'We see well-being as a development opportunity and encourage people to look after their

support of employee well-being.', 'As part of our regular employee listening, we ask employees three times a year to answer the following question: “How would you rate your psychological or emotional well-being at present?” This is measured on a five-point scale from very bad to very good.', 'In October 2021, 61 percent of employees responded “good” or “very good.” While the score increased, we did not achieve the target we set in 2020 of 63 percent by 2021, likely because of the unexpected continuation of the pandemic.', 'The gap of nine percentage points between men (64 percent) and women (55 percent) is substantial (and represents an increase from the gap of five percentage points recorded in October 2020) and requires further investigation.', 'We will continue to track progress on this indicator and aim to achieve a 70 percent score by 2025.', 'To get deeper insights, we piloted a tailored well-being study across six of our markets (one per region) in 2021.', 'The study methodology incorporated a survey (to which more than 3,600 office-based employees responded) and analytics aggregating information on the use of computer-based tools by employees (data were drawn from those employees who agreed to share such information on a confidential basis).', 'This two-pronged approach allowed us to analyze the root causes of well-being, ranging from our ways of working and relationships with managers to presenteeism and employees’ sense of belonging.', 'Leveraging the insights gathered, we aim to develop a well-being performance indicator that will allow us to measure holistic wellness, monitor progress, and identify appropriate interventions.', 'A global focus on mental health Mental health is critical to employee well-being.', 'Worryingly, issues of mental health are a growing problem globally, affecting nearly 10 percent of the world’s population and causing devastating impacts for the individuals directly affected and those close to them.1 There is also a business impact: Depression alone is estimated to cause USD 1 trillion in lost productivity every year.2 Strengthening resilience To build a solid well-being program, we must also look at how society and the workplace will evolve.', 'An aging population—and workforce— coupled with new ways of working and increased digitalization mean that people will need to learn new capabilities and skills and unlearn others (read more about our lifelong learning program here).', 'Against this backdrop, we want to foster a mindset that helps our employees embrace change and strengthens their resilience to maintain well-being over the long term.', 'In 2021, we piloted resilience deep-dive workshops in South Africa, accompanied by an online diagnostic tool.', 'We intend to expand those workshops in select geographies in 2022.', 'Supporting our employees We aim to provide well-being offerings that fit employee needs and expectations and that are anchored in the local context of where our people live and work.', 'Family and caregiver support Our goal is to promote an inclusive and equitable vision of care through our global parental leave principles, which provide primary caregivers a minimum of 18 weeks of fully paid parental leave and a secondary caregiver a minimum of eight weeks fully paid parental leave.', 'The rollout of those new global principles began in January 2021.', 'By the end of the year, more than 52 countries were aligned with the new global principles.', 'We aim to cover all our markets by the end of 2022.', 'We believe it is crucial to raise awareness and encourage conversations around mental health to equip employees to support themselves and others and also to remove the stigma around the issue.', 'In May 2021, we organized a Mental Health Conference, which attracted a broad global audience and received positive feedback from our employees.', 'Following this event, we organized a Mental Health Week in October, inviting PMI employees to share their stories and hosting talks with internal and external experts on topics ranging from how to spot and prevent burnout to the power of listening and recognition.', 'Encouragingly, we saw positive dynamics in how employees feel about PMI’s concern for their mental health and their awareness of where to go for help.', 'Surveys of participants conducted in May and October showed a significant improvement in responses to the questions “How reassured do you feel about PMI’s concern for your mental health?” and “How familiar are you with support available for you at PMI for mental health & well-being?” We have also convened a Well-being Advisory Group, a diverse body that includes senior leaders and well-being advocates from various functions and regions.', 'This group informed the development of the well-being framework and the roadmap of initiatives for 2022 and beyond.', 'It will continue to serve as a sounding board to help us recalibrate our strategy and initiatives as we progress.', 'From our research and listening to the markets, we know there is a lot of interest among employees in improving their knowledge of mental health, how to look after their own mental health, and how to support others who might be struggling.', 'To address this demand, we piloted Unmind, a workplace platform that provides a breadth of tools and training backed by the latest psychological research.', 'It is intended to help employees understand more about and proactively look after and improve their mental well-being and that of others around them.', 'The platform was made available in 10 countries in late 2021.', 'We will review the results of this pilot and, if it is successful, will roll it out further.', 'In parallel, we launched an online platform in 2021 that offers resources to support employees with the professional and personal challenges they may experience as a caregiver.', 'In addition, childcare facilities or contributions are provided in 28 of our markets.', 'Further, most of our sites offer dedicated spaces to be used as lactation rooms.', 'Supporting our employees and their families Our global Employee Assistance Program, launched in 2020, offers first-line support to our employees and their close relatives in the areas of psychological, financial, and legal counseling.', 'Support is provided in local languages across 79 countries under high standards of confidentiality.', 'By the end of 2021, the program covered 96 percent of our total workforce, with the remainder being covered by local schemes expected to transition to the global program in 2022 or 2023.', 'Flexible working arrangements Even prior to COVID-19 and the shift to remote work, PMI was promoting more balanced ways of working.',

that employees are permitted to work remotely up to 60 percent of the time, with the remainder of the workweek spent on- site.', 'The program is deployed and adjusted locally to account for cultural, operational, tax, and legal implications, which vary at the national level.', 'In 2021, we continued to deploy Smart Work in markets where COVID-19 was receding and where local circumstances allowed it.', 'By year-end, four markets had implemented it, and our intent is to launch it in most markets in 2022, subject to COVID-19 circumstances and restrictions.', 'Looking ahead, we plan to develop

mental health–related webinars, cooking classes, and other activities.', 'Since the pandemic outbreak in 2020, our primary focus has been on COVID-19 safety measures and psychological support, including encouraging employees to prioritize their well-being.', 'For instance, our affiliate in Vietnam launched Vibe, a locally led well-being initiative centered on helping employees connect via shared interests and encourage one another to look after their well- being.', 'Meanwhile, in the U.K., our affiliate launched a network of well-being ambassadors, composed of employees trained in mental health first aid.', 'They offer non-judgmental listening and guidance to colleagues who are experiencing mental health issues and are not sure where to go for help.', 'We will continue to build on these initiatives by broadening the reach of our well-being ambassadors and training them in mental health first aid, as the U.K. has done, and engaging employees in relevant local events led or initiated by their colleagues.', 'Looking ahead Building on the learnings gathered throughout 2021, we will continue to strengthen and deploy our employee well-being framework, with a focus globally on mental health.', 'We will also continue to address the stigma associated with mental health and pilot initiatives to improve awareness and help employees develop the skills and confidence to have conversations about it.', 'And we will continue rolling out our parental leave global guidelines, aiming to see them implemented in all markets by the end of 2022.', 'In 2022, we will set up an Inclusion & Diversity Advisory Council to foster open and constructive dialogue that will inform the development and execution of an integrated I&D strategy and monitor progress.', 'We expect this council to guide our company in establishing meaningful strategies to meet our commitments to enhancing diversity and promoting inclusion—in particular, our new ambitions for 2025 related to gender- balance in management and leadership, as well as an appropriate representation of nationalities within executive management teams.', 'Meanwhile, we plan to expand many initiatives piloted in 2021, such as our Women in Leadership program, resilience workshops, and our program to increase the representation of women in sales and in senior roles.', 'We also expect to celebrate the achievement of our 2022 target for female representation in managerial positions, and we are committed to fostering a gender-balanced organization as we progress toward our 2025 targets.', 'Our activities in 2022 will also focus on raising awareness of the importance of psychological safety and a sense of belonging at work through events and campaigns.', 'We will also continue to expand our employee resource groups by supporting our markets in establishing local chapters.', 'Silke Muenster, Chief Diversity Officer The health and safety of our employees will remain at the top of our agenda, and we will closely monitor how the pandemic evolves, adjusting our measures as needed and seeking ways to best support our employees.', 'Where conditions allow, we will continue the deployment of Smart Work, fostering flexibility in where employees work.', 'In parallel, we will seek to formalize our health and safety standards for remote work.', 'Continued development of our human capital is critical to PMI.', 'In 2022, we plan to revamp our approach to learning to ensure employees get clarity on the capabilities and skills that will both boost their employability and contribute to the success of PMI, and we will work to ensure they have access to training and education in these areas.', 'To that end, we will expand access to our lifelong learning program while seeking to strengthen it by

each growing season and visit the farms throughout the season to evaluate, among other things, how well labor practices align with the principles of the ALP Code.', 'These technicians raise “prompt actions” to flag and trigger an immediate response to any serious violation.', 'They also report “nonconformities”—identifying risks before they have evolved into issues, which helps us proactively mitigate them.', 'Field technicians work with farmers to develop remediation plans to address prompt actions and nonconformities identified, and they then follow up on and monitor these plans.', 'If the matter is not resolved within the agreed timeline, it is further escalated and may lead to sanctions, which can include contract termination.', 'External assessments: Control Union (CU), an

supply chain Poverty leads to poor working and living conditions, including the use of child labor.', 'We are aiming to improve the livelihoods of the contracted farmers supplying tobacco to PMI, thereby advancing the socioeconomic development of the communities in which they live.', 'We see this as fundamental to addressing social inequality, as well as other issues in our tobacco supply chain, and our aim is for all the contracted farmers supplying tobacco to PMI to make a living income by 2025.', 'Progress in 2021 Measuring income levels in our tobacco supply chain to drive meaningful action The living income value determines the net annual income required for a household to afford a decent standard of living for all its members.', 'We calculate it based on official benchmark studies, reference values, or internal desktop exercises.', 'In 2020, we tasked Social Accountability International (SAI) to conduct official living income benchmark studies in two sourcing markets—Malawi and Pakistan—in line with the Anker methodology.', 'Regrettably, COVID-19 restrictions delayed completion of the fieldwork and reporting.', 'It was therefore not until late 2021 that we received the final report for Pakistan and a draft report for Malawi.', 'In 2021, we also initiated official living income benchmark studies in four additional countries with SAI.', 'By year-end, the initial engagement with the researchers and our regional teams and local suppliers had commenced in India, Mexico, and the Philippines.', 'The fourth study, in Brazil, will commence in 2022.', 'We expect all four studies to be completed and the final reports received during 2022.', 'In three other markets (Argentina, Mozambique, and Turkey), we use reference values conducted in previous years, which represent the typical or average living incomes for rural areas within each country.', 'In the remainder of our sourcing markets, we calculate the living income value based on an internal desktop analysis following the Anker methodology.', 'In parallel, we assess the income level of our contracted farmers in each sourcing market, including both on-farm and off-farm activities, net of production cost, and including remittances or other subsidies.', 'On-farm activities include income generated from the sale of tobacco and the production of other crops and livestock, while off-farm income comes from revenue-generating activities outside the farm such as waged employment.', 'These analyses rely mostly on our internal farm-by-farm monitoring but may also incorporate third- party studies by local partners such as those conducted in India and Mexico in 2021.', 'When designing comprehensive action plans, we aim to exceed the living income benchmark targets that are required to achieve a decent standard of living.', 'This affords a buffer to accommodate potential fluctuations in farmer incomes due to climatic shocks or volatility due to market dynamics.', 'We periodically review the living income benchmarks to account for annual inflationary increases and revise farmer income studies to consider market dynamics that may impact farmers’ overall income.', 'Assessing income levels in our tobacco sourcing markets Robust analyses and studies to define living income values and assess current farmer incomes (and the potential gap between the two) across our sourcing markets form the backbone of our approach.', 'The insights captured in these studies allow us to track the proportion of contracted farmers making a living income.', 'This proportion increased significantly in 2021, reaching 67 percent (up from 48 percent in 2020), as a result of both important progress achieved in some focus markets like Argentina, Malawi, and Mozambique, as well as increased data availability in countries like Brazil, Greece, and Turkey.', 'Further, our analysis showed that our contracted farmers in several markets, including Brazil, Greece, Pakistan, and Turkey, already make a living income.', 'In other countries, such as Argentina, a significant proportion of them do so.', 'Based on the data, our studies confirmed the need to continue focusing our actions on four markets: Malawi, Mexico, Mozambique, and the Philippines.', 'Implementing targeted interventions to close the living income gap Driven by the results of our assessments, we implement various initiatives to improve income levels.', 'While we tailor activities to local realities and needs, our overall strategy is universal: Firstly, we aim to improve tobacco crop productivity and competitiveness.', 'Secondly, we seek to support households in diversifying their sources of income.', 'Improving productivity Our first focus is on enhancing tobacco production and encouraging farm efficiency.', 'We support the farmers in maximizing efficiencies on their farms— for example, by hiring only the labor required, making careful use of inputs such as fertilizer, and finding ways to increase yields per hectare.', 'The mechanization of certain steps of tobacco cultivation (such as field preparation) can maximize efficiencies by achieving labor savings and elevating yields.', 'In 2021, we continued to expand our mechanization program in Malawi and provide an opportunity for farmers to improve their productivity in tobacco.', 'A total of more than 1,600 smallholder farmers, covering nearly 2,900 hectares opted for mechanization services provided by 32 local entrepreneurs.', 'This mechanization initiative, in combination with other agricultural practices, generated a 10 percent increase in yields and the mechanized plowing itself has reduced by 37 percent the labor hours required for the land preparation of one hectare in Malawi.', 'Meanwhile in Mozambique, we initiated a mechanization pilot which we expect will cover 170 hectares.', 'In Argentina, the mechanization program continued in 2021 with the objective to improve farm productivity, mitigate potential risks associated with manual tasks, and contribute to soil conservation.', 'These services included soil preparation, transplanting, CPA spraying, and harvesting, with the predominant activity being soil preparation.', 'In the North West region of Argentina where flue-cured tobacco is grown, the mechanization initiatives generated a 30 percent reduction in the overall labor hours needed for the various crop stages.', 'In the North East region, where our Burley farmers are located, mechanized farmers were able to reduce by more than 50 percent the labor requirements for land preparation and have achieved an 18 percent increase in yields in the last crop season compared with nonmechanized farmers.', 'In India, the focus of the mechanization program is to increase labor efficiency and, in 2021, we implemented multiple initiatives with varying coverage among the farmer base.', 'These initiatives included seeding machines, transplanters, cultivators combined with fertilizer applicator, suckercide applicators, and stringing machines.', 'The predominant initiative is combining cultivators with fertilizer applicators, with 69 machines to date covering over 2,200 hectares and more than 2,800 farmers.', 'In Pakistan, the focus of the mechanization program is to increase labor efficiency while mitigating potential risks associated with manual tasks.', 'The initiatives implemented so far include mechanical earthing up machines, mechanical transplanters, CPA applicators, and stringing machines.', 'The predominant initiatives are mechanical earthing up, where we have 109 machines, covering 3,600 hectares and around 2,500 farmers and stringing machines where we have 168 machines, covering 549 hectares and 262 farmers.', 'The results obtained showed us that, with the mechanical transplanter, farmers were able to gain 41 percent efficiency compared with manual transplanting, the earthing up tools increased efficiency by 82 percent versus the manual work, the suckercide applicator led to a 25 percent efficiency gain, and, finally, the stringing machine resulted in a 27 percent efficiency gain compared with the manual stick and tying, also contributing to a reduction of child labor incidents.', 'Philip Morris International – Integrated Report 2021 148 149 Overview Strategy Operational impact Product impact Fundamentals Reporting and performance', 'Improve the quality of life of people in our supply chain Supporting households in diversifying their income sources We also look at opportunities to implement other income-generating activities.', 'Notably, the cultivation of complementary crops beyond tobacco can improve farm income while enhancing resilience against climate change and economic uncertainty.', 'In 2021, we estimate that around two-thirds of our contracted farmers also grew crops other than tobacco.', 'For instance, during the year, we supported the establishment of microbusiness programs in Indonesia with 104 women beneficiaries to produce backyard crops such as herbs, spices, yams, and papaya.', 'Meanwhile, in Argentina and India (reaching 236 and 360 farmers, respectively) we expanded the production of okra, cluster bean, tomato, cowpea, and maize.', 'Additionally, in Pakistan, the initiatives to produce mushrooms and backyard vegetables were expanded to close to 600 farmers and around 2,400 farmers respectively.', 'Lastly, in Mozambique, we expanded the treadle- pump and winter-crop support project to an additional 1,760 farmers, bringing the total beneficiaries to date to over 3,000, with an estimated 600 hectares under treadle-pump irrigation production.', 'Mitigating the impact of the gradual decrease in our tobacco demand The growth of our smoke-free business intentionally results in a simultaneous decline of our cigarette business.', 'This translates into a gradual decrease in our overall demand for tobacco leaf.', 'Over the past five years, our demand for leaf fell 21 percent, from 370 million kilograms in 2016 down to approximately 291 million kilograms in 2021.', 'This resulted in a reduction in the volume of tobacco we purchase in some markets and the elimination of our sourcing activities in others.', 'Such change has an undeniable impact on contracted farmers, especially those whose primary source of income traditionally has derived from tobacco growing.', 'We are aiming to address and, to the extent we can, minimize the negative effects of this shift.', 'We do this through a dedicated assessment of the unique realities and contingencies that define each country or region where we source tobacco, building an understanding of the local ecosystem to tailor and implement sustainable solutions that can help farmers transition to sustainable alternative livelihoods where needed.', 'In some cases, farmers are not heavily reliant on tobacco production for their livelihoods, have the means to easily switch to other crops, or will continue to grow tobacco for other customers.', 'In other geographies, we provide additional support to help mitigate the negative impact of our reduced purchases (read, for instance, about our efforts in Colombia—where we stopped purchasing tobacco—in our 2020 Integrated Report).', 'More broadly, the initiatives we implement to help contracted farmers earn a living income support the elimination of farming inefficiencies.', 'They also promote practices—such as mechanization and irrigation technologies— that improve productivity of the tobacco crop and also help farmers diversify their production to other crops.', 'We expect these efforts to play an important role in minimizing the potential negative economic impacts on contracted farmers of our transformation and consequential reduction in demand for tobacco.', 'Enhancing access to water, sanitation, and hygiene among tobacco-farming communities The link between poverty and inadequate access to water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) is well established.', 'We know, too, that enhancing WASH infrastructure can substantially improve the well- being and livelihoods of community members.', 'To ensure all farmers within PMI’s footprint have basic access to water by 2025 and to sanitation and hygiene by 2030, we developed a framework guided by the Joint Monitoring Programme for Water Supply, Sanitation and Hygiene (JMP), established by the WHO and UNICEF.', 'In 2021, we collected global WASH data through farm-by-farm monitoring and surveys, applying JMP’s universal indicators.', 'This research has identified Argentina as an additional priority market for drinking water access (alongside Malawi and Mozambique), and an implementation plan has been developed focused on springs protection.', 'We also developed water quality guidelines, water availability guidelines, and an animated training video that explains the concepts and importance of WASH to our farmers.', 'Joint efforts with our suppliers on providing drinking water access in Malawi and Mozambique continued in 2021, with the drilling of 114 new handpump boreholes in Malawi, 55 in Mozambique, and the rehabilitation of 50 boreholes in Malawi and 50 boreholes in Mozambique.', 'Since many boreholes are nonfunctioning in Africa, rehabilitation is an essential part of our strategy.', 'Empowering women involved in tobacco farming Around the world, women participate in agriculture both as members of family farming households and as hired wage labor on farms owned and operated by other households or companies.', 'Many of the gender inequalities faced by women in general are exacerbated for women in agriculture.', 'Globally, less than 15 percent of agricultural land is owned by women,1 and women involved in tobacco farming often face structural and cultural barriers such as gender gaps in earnings, financial inclusion, access to credit, employment segmentation, lack of ownership of land and property, inadequate opportunities to receive training or technical support, and difficulty balancing domestic responsibilities.', 'Since the inception of our ALP program, gender equality and fair treatment have been incorporated as key principles in all the countries from which we source tobacco.', 'When we evolved the program to include a Step Change approach in 2018, we seized the opportunity to strengthen our contribution to gender equality, taking into consideration the instrumental role women play in improving household economic conditions and addressing child labor and other social challenges.', 'Consequently, PMI’s ALP program now deploys across our sourcing markets several initiatives focused on women empowerment.', 'These initiatives include, for instance, self-help groups in India through which women help one another start microbusinesses, a women-only ALP task force to perform monitoring in Pakistan, and entrepreneurship training and information on healthcare services for women farmers and their spouses in Argentina.', '1 Source: Food and Agriculture Organization of the United States.', 'Philip Morris International – Integrated Report 2021 150 151 Overview Strategy

PMI’s Agricultural Labor Practices Our ALP Code principles are as follows: No child labor, fair income and work hours, no forced labor or human trafficking, a safe work environment, fair treatment, freedom of association, and terms of employment.', 'In 2021, 2,530 field technicians contracted by either PMI or our leaf suppliers systematically monitored the implementation of the principles and measurable standards of ALP on 91 percent of all 253,813 contracted farms (2020: 93 percent).', 'The monitoring in 2021 continued to be impacted by COVID-19 restrictions in certain markets.', 'In Indonesia, where national restrictions limited their ability to physically visit farmers, field technicians made contact and conducted remote monitoring through mobile phones and digital applications.', 'Likewise, when the government in the Philippines implemented restrictions in specific towns and villages due to a rise in COVID-19 cases, our leaf suppliers’ technicians conducted remote monitoring via mobile phones.', 'We are committed to continually strengthening our monitoring to improve our visibility of existing issues, take a more risk-based approach, and more effectively address the issues identified.', 'Our 2021 ALP monitoring farm-level data covers 20 out of the 21 countries from which we sourced in 2021—data set for Switzerland was not included.', 'For the first year, however, 100 percent of the Swiss farms were monitored by an independent company.', 'These farms were visited once during the season and the purpose of this visit was to validate the results obtained from a self-assessment questionnaire completed by the farmers.', 'Total prompt actions recorded by field technicians (2019–2021) This first year of monitoring highlighted non- conformities with our ALP Code that were extensively discussed with SOTA (cooperative responsible for the purchase of Swiss tobacco) and SwissTabac (Swiss tobacco farmers association) that contracts with the farmers.', 'According to Swiss Tobacco Tax legislation, the Swiss government can oblige companies making and selling cigarettes in Switzerland to purchase a certain amount of tobacco cultivated in the country.', 'In that regard, due to the uniqueness of the contractual relationship our company has through SOTA with SwissTabac and all of the Swiss tobacco farmers, our ability to enforce our agricultural labor practices is more limited, and so is our ability to influence our ALP Code’s full adoption.', 'This is because some of our ALP requirements (which align with ILO’s standards and definitions of child labor) are more stringent than Swiss law.', 'We remain, however, committed to continue promoting our ALP principles and furthering their implementation in Switzerland.', 'In 2021, field technicians reported a total of 9,918 prompt actions across all sourcing markets, of which 76 percent related to safe working environment issues, 11 percent to child labor incidents, and 13 percent to income and working hours.', 'In total, 86 percent of the prompt actions raised were resolved during the year, with the remaining 14 percent of prompt actions followed-up yet not resolved, predominantly due to the timing of the crop stage.', 'In addition to internal monitoring, Control Union conducted external assessments in one market in 2021 (China).', 'The assessment scheduled in Indonesia was postponed to 2022 due to COVID-19 restrictions.', 'External verification by local third-party organizations was undertaken in six markets.', 'Moreover, during the year, we actively collaborated with a peer company and our common tobacco leaf supplier to conduct a targeted human rights impact assessment in the tobacco supply chain in Turkey (read more here).', 'Across the countries from which we source tobacco, the most recurrent and difficult challenges relate to work performed by children, insufficient use of personal protective equipment, and payment of a minimum legal wage (or formalized agricultural benchmark) to farmworkers.', 'We have developed and are implementing action plans to address these recurrent issues in collaboration with key stakeholders, including our strategic partner Verité, local NGOs, and governments.', 'The overwhelming majority of our relationships with contracted farmers feature a shared commitment to continuous improvement in

nonconformities by reinforcing our risk-based approach in our farm-by-farm monitoring to strengthen procedures and techniques to better identify risks.', 'These are identified through interviews with or direct observations from the farmer and workers on a farm or their direct observations brought to the attention of field technicians.', 'Their reporting helps us flag risks and proactively mitigate them.', '2.', 'Consolidated reporting: This means reporting child labor incidences raised as prompt actions by field technicians by aggregating them per type (children under 18 doing hazardous tasks, children under 15 hired, and children under 13 doing any tobacco-related task).', 'Based on these enhancements, we calculate child labor prevalence using the prompt actions and the newly introduced self-declared nonconformities reported during the farm-by-farm monitoring, covering all types of child labor, and with respective weighting factors of 100% (prompt actions) and 50% (self-declared nonconformities).', 'We conduct this exercise for every sourcing market, and the global prevalence is a weighted average based on the number of farmers.', 'Additionally, for priority markets, the methodology supplements the internal monitoring data with data collected through third-party verifications.', 'The objective is to achieve higher accuracy in our global and per-country child labor prevalence by integrating learnings from these assessments (including issues raised) into our calculation.', 'This comprehensive approach acknowledges the limitations of our internal monitoring system: The field technicians are only present on the farms for a limited time during the growing season, and the issues we face are complex and often persistent.', 'Eliminating child labor We maintain a relentless focus on preventing incidents of child labor and take immediate action when they arise.', 'Our objective is to eradicate child labor cases in our tobacco supply chain that are repetitive and systemic by 2025.', 'We acknowledge that isolated cases—even when systemic occurrences are fully addressed—might persist due to farmer turnover or unintentional misbehaviors, and we will remain alert and tackle them promptly when identified.', 'We use International Labour Organization standards to measure our progress toward our target of zero child labor.', 'Our traditional reporting approach centers on preventing children from performing hazardous tasks.', 'In 2020, we introduced a new methodology to include the employment of children under age 15 and children under 13 doing any tobacco-related tasks.', 'This new methodology reinforces our risk-based due diligence processes as it improves visibility and granularity on child labor across our sourcing markets.', 'Results over the past two years show a decline in the prevalence of child labor among our contracted farms, from 3.5 percent in 2020 to 1.8 percent in 2021.', 'This decrease is mainly attributed to Argentina, Mexico, Mozambique, and Turkey, where we observed the positive impact of years of implementation of the ALP Program.', 'We are, however, cautious of this positive trend, as in 2021, the COVID-19 pandemic continued to impact our initiatives and child labor remediation actions.', 'Further, we acknowledge the limitations of our monitoring system, as well as the complex and persistent nature of child labor.', 'Nonetheless, our field technicians continued to conduct farm-by-farm monitoring where possible and to support farmers in addressing and remedying child labor risks and incidents.', 'Types of prompt action recorded in 2021 relating to hazardous work performed by children During 2021, field technicians monitored 98 percent of contracted farms for child labor-related issues and recorded a total of 1,175 prompt actions (2020: 99 percent; 2,352 prompt actions).', 'Of those, 1,121 cases involved children performing hazardous tasks (2020: 2,285), 16 related to children under 15 hired (2020: three), and 38 pertained to children under 13 performing light work (2020: 64).', 'In total, these prompt actions involved 1,609 children, with 93 percent of them being the farmers’ children.', 'The most common tasks field technicians found the children doing were harvesting or handling green tobacco and stringing.', 'A significant proportion of this reduction comes from Turkey, which can be mainly attributed to a change in sourcing footprint versus 2020.', 'Of all child labor-related prompt actions recorded in 2021, 99 percent were resolved, and the remaining 1 percent had monitored action plans in place.', 'Field technicians further support our efforts to remediate prompt actions and eradicate child labor by raising awareness and offering training,

benchmark standard.', 'In 2021, we monitored the wages of 91 percent of our contracted tobacco farmers and found that 95 percent of farmworkers were paid at least the minimum wage (2020: 65 percent).', 'Field technicians recorded a total of 1,154 prompt actions related to farmers paying less than the minimum wage to their workers (2020: 1,541).', 'The data reflects significant progress due to an increased focus on minimum wage payment, along with relevant controls implemented during pre-contracting due diligence and the delivery of targeted training.', 'Tackling the challenges linked to minimum wage in India The issue of minimum wage payment in agriculture in India is complex and widespread across the country.', 'In Vinukonda, the tobacco growing area falls across three different zones where each of the local governments set their legal minimum wage, which is updated twice per year.', 'Minimum wage varies by tasks for all crops, resulting in some activities requiring higher wages than others.', 'Based on engagement with stakeholders, farmers follow unofficial benchmarks agreed at the village level before the crop season starts and may not align with the government legislation on minimum wage rates.', 'In addition, these unofficial benchmarks may vary due to supply and demand for workers during the key crop stages and payment to women workers is typically lower compared to men.', 'Given the different wages paid to men and women workers and the fluctuating unofficial benchmarks, PMI together with our local suppliers considered it necessary to monitor the payment of wages throughout the various tobacco stages.', 'The monitoring is based on key data collected, including the number of hired men and women workers, actual wages paid, and the number of hours they work, among others.', 'Based on these data points, a weighted average of the combined tasks performed during the crop season per farm is applied to determine if the farmer is paying the legal minimum wage.', 'This methodology is conducted on a representative sample within the relevant zones with the results extrapolated to the total farmer base.', 'In order to proactively address payment gaps, we have implemented two initiatives.', 'Firstly, we are rolling out mechanization for labor-intensive tasks such as transplanting, inter-cultivation, and stitching of harvested leaves, which aims to improve efficiencies on the farm.', 'Secondly, we are piloting the payment support to workers, aiming to bridge the gap between the actual average wage and the legal minimum wage by directly providing payment support to eligible workers at the end of the tobacco season.', 'The impact of these initiatives will be assessed during its implementation and continuously monitored throughout 2022.', 'Depending on the results, we will explore further expansion of these initiatives.', 'Further, year-on-year change was also driven by improved data quality and availability, allowing enhanced measurement.', 'While encouraged by the progress made so far, we know that wage-related challenges relate not only to substandard payment but also to informal terms of employment, inconsistency between supply and demand of labor, and workers’ lack of knowledge about their rights.', 'In the past, a challenge we faced in some countries related to the lack of an applicable legal minimum wage, such as in Indonesia, or formalized agricultural benchmark, such as in Argentina.', 'In 2021, following extensive stakeholder engagement or introduction of new legislation, the minimum

energy and process efficiencies and replacing fossil fuel-based energy with renewable sources.', 'We compensate for our absolute carbon emissions as a last resort— once we have maximized our emissions reduction.', 'Decarbonizing our factories Reducing carbon emissions in our manufacturing sites relies first and foremost on promoting efficient energy use.', 'We achieve this through our Drive 4 Zero program, which establishes a common way of working across our factories, advances a zero-loss mindset, and empowers employees to identify and implement improvements.', 'In addition to enhancing energy

including, for example, the optimization of compressed air, steam, and cooling systems, heat-recovery projects, LED lighting, and electric motor replacement.', 'We also look at opportunities to leverage technology to deliver significant carbon savings.', 'For instance, in 2021, we deployed across all our manufacturing sites a new learning algorithm that allowed us to upgrade our ventilation and air conditioning system, decreasing the energy required to release the same humidity and temperature factory conditions by around 20 percent.', 'In parallel, we are continuing our gradual switch to renewable energy sources.', 'We implement technologies to generate renewable energy, such as photovoltaic panels, biomass boilers and heat pumps, and tri-generation processes (combining cooling, heat, and power).', 'Fostering carbon neutrality in our fleet Our fleet of nearly 22,000 vehicles registered over 380 million kilometers driven in 2021.', 'Most (80 percent) of our fleet vehicles are working tool vehicles, used primarily to visit point-of-sale locations and distribute our products, with the rest being benefit cars.', 'Following the development of our carbon neutrality strategy for our fleet in 2020 and the strengthening of our organizational capabilities with the setup of our fleet center of expertise, we instituted a new Global Vehicle Fleet policy early in 2021.', 'This policy frames our fleet strategy and moves us to a more centralized operating model to help ensure that every PMI affiliate contributes to our global goal of becoming carbon neutral (scope 1+2) by 2025.', 'To reduce carbon emissions in our fleet, we invest in sustainable powertrains and effective driving to optimize energy consumption while improving operational efficiency.', 'During 2021, we selected more environmentally friendly powertrains such as hybrid and electric vehicles to guide the renewal of our fleet.', 'We anticipate these new vehicles will emit 40 percent less carbon emissions than the models they replaced.', 'Since rolling out our policy, more than 40 percent of approved models are powered by sustainable alternatives; this includes all of the newly approved models in the major markets of Australia, Canada, Europe, and New Zealand.', 'We will remain focused on retiring our most polluting cars subject to the availability of appropriate infrastructure, legislation, and technological innovation.', 'By the end of 2021, vehicles with sustainable powertrains (electric or hybrid) represented 10 percent of our fleet globally (2020: 5 percent).', 'We leverage eco-training and telematics to improve driver behavior and further engage employees in our sustainability agenda.', 'By the end of 2021, one- third of company drivers were enrolled in the first year of our fleet safety e-learning program, which incorporates eco-driving modules.', 'We expect all drivers to enroll by the end of 2023.', 'Of the group offered this training, 70 percent participated in the course.', 'We anticipate the participation rate will climb to 85 percent in 2022.', 'Nearly half (47 percent) of our working tool cars are equipped with telematics—a technology that provides the driver and company with data on driving behaviors to improve road safety and decrease carbon emissions (2020: 35 percent).', 'For example, in our factory in Switzerland, the pyrolysis technology installed in 2020 allowed us to use operational waste instead of fossil fuels to produce steam and hot water; we are currently fine-tuning our pyrolysis setup, which is expected to deliver significant carbon reductions in the years to come.', 'Meanwhile, in Portugal, we completed the installation of a solar carport at our Tabaqueira factory, which we expect will reduce carbon emissions by up to 828 tons per year.', 'Worldwide, 7 percent of the energy used in our factories in 2021 was self-generated by innovative technologies (2020: 2 percent).', 'To increase this proportion, we developed an internal tool during 2021 that creates a portfolio of zero-carbon technologies and assesses them against specific risks and attributes.', 'This tool will help us select and implement the most impactful solutions across our manufacturing sites.', 'We are also considering the establishment of direct power purchase agreements with large-scale solar, wind, hydro, and geothermal installations and small-scale hydropower schemes.', 'In 2021, 81 percent of the electricity used in our factories came from renewable sources (up from 78 percent in 2020), and we are on track to achieve our target of 100 percent by 2025.', 'Our efforts to enhance efficiency and switch to renewables offset the increased energy required to produce our smoke-free product consumables compared with cigarettes (the extra energy required is mainly due to the additional steam needed in the manufacturing process).', 'Indeed, our efforts in 2021 led to an overall reduction of around 12 percent in our absolute GHG emissions in our factories versus 2020, approximately half of it driven by our efficiency initiatives and the remaining half by our switch to renewable energy sources.', 'During the year, we certified three additional sites in the Czech Republic, Mexico, and Portugal as carbon neutral, bringing the total to five factories certified to date.', 'We are well on track to

'Together, they accounted for 1 percent of our total carbon footprint in 2021.', 'During the year, we continued to gain visibility into energy use at those sites and prepared action plans to optimize energy consumption and promote the switch to renewable sources.', 'We strengthened our capabilities to collect accurate environmental data for all our offices and warehouses, up from a third of them in 2020, extending accurate data collection to over 400 locations worldwide.', 'And we continued to define minimum energy efficiency expectations for office equipment in the markets where we have initially targeted carbon neutrality.', 'We plan to extend these expectations to additional markets by the end of 2022.', 'Overall, carbon emissions from our offices and warehouses decreased by 46 percent versus the 2019 baseline, continuing the positive trend from 2020.', 'This is due, in part, to awareness campaigns, more accurate internal emissions reporting, and reduced office use due to COVID-19 restrictions and precautions.', 'Setting up our Portfolio of Climate Investments In 2021, we created a Portfolio of Climate Investments (PCI) to standardize and provide transparency on our approach to investments in offsets and insets.', 'Such investments compensate for unavoidable carbon emissions related to our direct operations and are essential to achieving our 2025 carbon neutrality goal.', 'To ensure management’s endorsement and alignment with the mid-term strategy of the company, the PCI is supervised by an advisory committee composed of cross-functional PMI senior leaders (including our Chief Sustainability Officer and SVP, Operations, among others).', 'The committee revises and validates the proposals prepared by the project team and approves the allocation of resources to the proposed climate solutions through an investment strategy that leverages the budget generated by PMI’s carbon levy scheme.', 'To support decarbonization efforts, PMI believes that limiting the use of market approaches (offsetting) in the short-term by prioritizing direct investment in our supply chain in the medium and long term (insetting) will result in a climate investment strategy that is cost-effective, transparent, consistent, and of high quality.', 'We expect a higher annual budget in the first years of running the PCI, in line with PMI’s business emissions profile, to support investments in a long- term climate solution.', 'The financial requirements of PMI’s PCI are expected to decrease once medium- and long-term scope 1+2 carbon reduction investments become operational and generate emissions reductions or removals.', 'We also anticipate a decrease in the levy budget as our emissions profile shrinks.', 'Where additional funding will be required for specific investments (e.g., unlocking innovative climate solutions and R&D), the advisory committee that governs the PCI will decide on approval.', 'A set of mechanisms and rules—the PCI quality criteria— allows PMI to efficiently evaluate which climate solutions are most appropriate to pursue.', 'Core carbon principles and additional attributes strongly support the development of nature-based solutions in PMI’s supply chain that generate benefits beyond carbon reduction or removal, such as ecosystem conservation and enhancement and positive impacts on local communities.', 'To assess whether an investment will meet our quality criteria and generate a positive impact, we employ an external due diligence process managed with a proprietary methodology developed with PMI’s carbon finance adviser Clarmondial.', 'This methodology considers GHG mitigation, biodiversity conservation, and community benefits.', 'Clarmondial also supported PMI in establishing relationships that can support the company’s long-term climate, community, and nature-related targets in priority countries.', 'In 2021, PMI’s PCI invested over USD 4 million in projects in Brazil, Laos, Malawi, Mozambique, and Uganda, with a focus on forest protection, reforestation, and the enhancement of quality of life through activities such as the provision of clean water access.', 'Moreover, the PCI focused on securing high-quality offsets to support PMI’s decarbonization journey, and provided the required carbon offsets for the five manufacturing sites that achieved carbon neutrality certification during the calendar year.', 'Pricing carbon Assigning a price—and hence a theoretical cost—to emissions makes the intangible tangible and further incentivizes action to reduce the emissions that contribute to global warming.', 'PMI reviewed its carbon pricing policy in 2020 and took a pioneering approach by developing two complementary internal carbon pricing instruments: a shadow price of USD 65 per ton of CO2e and a carbon levy of USD 8 per ton of CO2e.', 'Our shadow carbon price is integrated into the preparation and financial evaluation of business proposals that will impact our carbon emissions.', 'This was instrumental in helping justify the approval of eight carbon emission reduction projects in 2021.', 'While the shadow price helps prioritize the business case for investments in activities aimed at structurally reducing carbon emissions, our carbon levy helps determine the investments required to abate our emissions through offsetting or insetting initiatives.', 'The levy is designed to internalize costs and support behavioral change by imposing a virtual internal tax on selected business units for their GHG emissions.', 'This helps us determine a budget for a portfolio of climate investments dedicated to projects focused on nature-based solutions and community investments in markets relevant to PMI’s supply chain and to our global environmental strategy.', 'These projects aim to generate high-quality carbon insets with co-benefits such as biodiversity protection, water stewardship, and livelihoods development.', 'We revise our shadow price and carbon levy annually to reflect changes in our risk and emissions profiles.', 'Scaling deployment of carbon removal technologies will be key for PMI to achieve its 2040 net zero

we are committed to achieving an absolute reduction in carbon emissions in our tobacco supply chain of 35 percent by 2025 and 50 percent by 2030 versus our 2019 baseline.', 'To deliver on these targets, we continue deploying efforts to decarbonize the tobacco curing process while implementing additional reduction initiatives focused on the use of fertilizer and mechanization.', 'Decarbonizing tobacco curing We mainly source three types of tobacco: Virginia, Burley, and Oriental.', 'While Burley and Oriental tobaccos, once harvested, are air- and sun-cured to dry out the leaves, Virginia tobacco (which represents close to half of our purchased volume and is sourced across 12 markets) is generally cured using an external heat source—a process called “flue-curing.” Curing barns can be heated with coal, diesel, natural gas, firewood, or biofuels containing agricultural or wood-sawing by-products.', 'The GHG emissions of flue-cured tobacco represented 4 percent of our total carbon footprint in 2021 and close to a quarter of the total GHG emissions generated in our tobacco supply chain.', 'Having achieved a 77 percent reduction in GHG emissions per kilogram of flue-cured tobacco between 2010 and 2020, we are now committed to a further 75 percent reduction in emissions generated by curing one kilogram of flue-cured tobacco by 2025 (versus our 2019 baseline).', 'To deliver on this ambitious target, we focus on improving curing-barn efficiency and increasing the use of renewable fuels.', 'We made good progress in 2021, achieving a 64 percent reduction in emissions per kilogram of tobacco from flue-curing versus 2019.', 'In 2021, 100 percent of the tobacco we purchased was cured with no risk of deforestation of primary or protected forests.', 'Read more about our forestry management ambitions and progress here.', 'Another driver of progress is our continued focus on the phase-out of coal via the conversion of curing infrastructures to enable the switch to renewable fuels.', 'In 2021, 3 percent of the flue-cured tobacco we purchased was cured with coal (down from 11 percent in 2020); all of it originated from the Yunnan and Guizhou provinces of China.', 'In those regions, we continued to support the multistakeholder initiative, led by the China National Tobacco Corporation, to convert curing barns from coal to biomass and create a fuel pellets supply chain produced from agricultural waste.', 'Local communities are playing a vital role in the project, having created a network of pelletizing plants sufficient to provide enough bioenergy to support both the tobacco supply chain and the needs of local infrastructure such as public buildings.', 'In 2021, 85 percent of the tobacco we purchased from China was cured with biomass, up from 49 percent in 2020.', 'We remain committed to eliminating coal from our curing fuel portfolio by the end of 2023.', 'Reducing GHG emissions from fertilizers In 2021, emissions related to the use of fertilizers in tobacco production contributed to 8.5 percent of PMI’s total carbon footprint.', 'Nitrogen-based fertilizers are essential in commercial agriculture to assist farmers in achieving appropriate yields.', 'Continuous decrease of fertilizer application is challenging, therefore we are addressing fertilizer emissions from different angles.', 'The drivers that will help support emission reductions globally include the preference in volume allocation to markets using fertilizers more efficiently, the increase in input-output efficiency, and the gradual decrease in our overall tobacco demand.', 'We are working on providing guidance for selecting fertilizer providers taking into consideration their manufacturing emissions.', 'We are also exploring innovative technologies that could curb field emissions from nitrogen-based fertilizers.', 'In particular, we will test the impact of improved irrigation techniques on nitrogen volatilization and evaluate the difference in emissions that small changes in timing of application of the fertilizer can trigger.', 'Additionally, we seek to optimize the use of fertilizer.', 'This requires us to better manage the portion of applied fertilizers that is not taken up by the crop and therefore causes nitrogen volatilization.', 'In 2021, an external partner audited our suppliers, mostly remotely due to COVID-19 restrictions on travel and partially on-site where conditions allowed.', 'These audits covered all flue-cured origins to verify carbon reduction activities and data on fuel use per

typical 15-kilometer buffer.', 'The forest districts we monitor in northern Pakistan include dry terrain with sparse vegetation cover, making satellite observation extremely difficult and prone to error.', 'We invested in detailed analysis to precisely determine the forest types within our supply chain (natural protected, natural managed, planted, non-forest vegetation) to cross-check our internal monitoring and external audit results.', 'This revealed that the outcomes of our 2019–2021 land cover satellite assessment were largely in sync with the figures reported for the farmers in our monitoring system, thereby confirming the compliance of the renewable curing fuel program we implemented in Pakistan with our forest protection criteria and requirements.', 'Land use change We estimate that approximately 221,000 hectares of land are used to grow the tobacco we source.', 'The surface forest areas that produce wood for biomass and curing fuel represent, by our best estimate, more than 41,000 additional hectares.', 'Both land use figures increased in 2021.', 'This increase is due to changes in our tobacco volumes linked to our sourcing strategy and the expansion of forest areas used for curing fuels, including the increase in biomass use in China in substitution to coal (read more here).', 'Risks associated with land use change resulting from tobacco farming are not considered significant.', 'The use of more-productive tobacco seed varieties and the implementation of practices in line with PMI’s Good Agricultural Practices (GAP) principles and standards help maximize yield per hectare, improve farmer income, and thus reduce pressure to expand crops into surrounding forests.', 'In light of these trends and the global contraction of the amount of land needed to fulfill our crop requirements, our analysis shows no direct deforestation risk associated with our tobacco sourcing.', 'A 2019 land use change study by Quantis confirmed this, and our analysis of farming areas is consistent with the figures on land use change we calculate annually for our tobacco-growing areas, including forest and natural ecosystems such as peatland, wetland, savanna, and native grassland.', 'Promoting the switch to sustainable fuels to cure Virginia tobacco The curing process for Virginia tobacco takes place in barns heated by a variety of fuel sources, including firewood and woody biomass (pellets, woodchips).', 'To mitigate the risk of firewood collection contributing to deforestation, we are increasing the efficiency of curing barns to minimize the use of fuel.', 'We are also deploying our Monitoring, Verification, and Reporting (MVR) Framework for Sustainable Curing Fuels across our entire flue-cured supply chain; the framework requires the traceability of firewood to ensure it originates from sustainable sources.', 'And we encourage the use of agriculture-derived fuels where they do not compete with food production or negatively affect food security.', 'For these reasons, the agrofuels used are primarily by-products of upstream food processing, such as olive pits and fruit stones in Spain and Italy and mulberry prunings in China.', 'In 2021, we fully embedded the updated requirements and ambitions of our Zero Deforestation Manifesto in our MVR, and we communicated these updates to our tobacco leaf suppliers through a set of tailored guidelines.', 'We use our MVR to systematically monitor the sustainability of all fuel types used in our tobacco supply chain, which includes a requirement to maintain a full chain of custody for the firewood used in the curing process.', 'Data gathered through our MVR are verified by a third party.', 'In 2021, all suppliers of flue-cured tobacco were audited, either with a desktop or on-site audit, across the countries where we source this type of tobacco.', 'Our efforts have delivered significant progress: In 2021, 75 percent of the flue-cured tobacco we purchased was cured using renewable and traceable fuels (2020: 67 percent).', 'Further, between 2015 and 2021, across our global tobacco supply chain, the average amount of wood used for curing decreased from 5.7 kilograms to 3.9 kilograms per kilogram of cured tobacco, a reduction of 32 percent.', 'Building live barns for tobacco curing in Malawi and Mozambique The Burley tobacco we purchase from Malawi and Mozambique is air-cured in barns made of timber, which needs to be replaced regularly, placing forests at risk.', 'To reduce this risk, we promote the use of “live barns,” which use living trees as curing poles and remain in place for many years.', 'During 2021, we partnered with our suppliers to plant approximately 6,000 live barns in Mozambique and 12,000 in Malawi, reaching a cumulative total of around 94,000

responsibly From tobacco cultivation to manufacturing, our products require water.', 'Our agricultural supply chain accounts for around half of our water footprint.', 'The second-largest share of our water use (around 40 percent) derives from other sectors of our supply chain—in particular, the processes by which the filters, paper, and packaging materials we source are manufactured.', 'Our direct operations are not particularly water- intensive, representing around 5 percent of our water footprint, with fresh water used for manufacturing, sanitation, and other processes.', 'Water is a renewable yet finite resource shared by all.', 'We can help combat water scarcity and advance global health and food security by responsibly managing our impacts on water, especially in water-stressed regions.', 'Water stewardship in our tobacco supply chain The quantity, quality, and timing of water availability all impact the growth of tobacco plants.', 'For about 60 percent of the farmland in our supply chain, the growing season is synced to the rain season, enabling crops to be rain-fed during the open field stage.', 'Where we use irrigation, we are mindful of the risk of baseline water stress when conducting local risk assessments.', 'Overall, irrigation accounts for around half the water used to grow the tobacco we source, with an average of 339 cubic meters used for irrigation per ton of tobacco produced in 2021.', 'Since we started measuring it in 2018, the total water requirement related to our purchased tobacco volume has gradually decreased in absolute terms; however, our supply chain is subject to off-trend years.', 'We experienced such a year in 2021, when the effects of climate change-driven events caused our water consumption to increase.', 'The leading cause of unforeseen water use is seasonal variability, where temperature and air moisture conditions vary outside temporal series standard values, causing soil water stress conditions that can be mitigated by increasing irrigation volumes.', 'We expect irrigation needs to increase in terms of intensity (i.e., water required per ton of tobacco produced) as we are recording a continuous increase in risk factors linked to seasonal variability in the tobacco-growing areas where we operate.', 'Assessing water risks Evaluating and understanding water risk across our tobacco supply chain is critical to making informed decisions and effectively managing water resources.', 'We conduct a global water risk assessment annually in our tobacco supply chain using the World Resources Institute’s Aqueduct risk-mapping tool.', 'The tool analyzes physical water risks in all the tobacco-growing areas from which we source and forecasts patterns regarding the watershed scale that is likely to emerge in coming years.', 'Risks such as floods, upstream land use, and baseline water stress influence water availability for agriculture and community use and can also impact our tobacco farmers.', 'Therefore, our global assessments take into account a wider hydrologic region than that devoted to tobacco cultivation.', 'Impact of climate change on water Climate change is expected to affect rainfall patterns worldwide, placing pressure on water supplies and potentially restricting water availability for agriculture and certain industry sectors.', 'Given the global reach of PMI’s value chain, climate change-driven water scarcity could present a substantive threat to our business objectives in the mid to long term.', 'Consequently, properly managing lands and water resources is a priority for PMI as we seek to increase the resilience of our production systems and minimize operational risks.', 'We conduct a global water risk assessment annually in tobacco-growing regions to identify potential hotspots for physical water risks that require adaptation measures.', 'In the past two years, we strengthened our water stewardship strategy, developing guidance for applying a

accounts for overall watershed risk, including but not limited to drought, upstream land use, and baseline water stress.', 'To complement our global exercise, we routinely conduct local water assessments, which leverage primary data sources and interviews with stakeholders to gauge both external and internal water risk on the ground.', 'The external criteria assessment looks at the drivers of risk at the watershed level that are affecting all stakeholders, while the internal criteria focus on tobacco farming, forecasting risk sensitivity for farmers in our supply chain.', 'Since 2018, we have completed 31 local water risk assessments (representing approximately two-thirds of our total tobacco-growing areas), and we aim to cover all tobacco-growing areas by the end of 2025.', 'In 2021, we conducted on-the-ground water risk assessments in Argentina, Brazil, the Philippines, and Turkey.', 'These assessments helped identify the shared water challenges that are a necessary starting point for properly designed risk mitigation initiatives.', 'A frequent challenge recorded in our 2021 local risk assessments is competing demands for limited water supplies.', 'For instance, in the Fırat-Dicle Basin in Turkey, we see competition for water resources between agriculture and manufacturing industries.', 'Other challenges identified include the awareness of farmers of water-related issues in the Alto Iguaçu watershed in Brazil and groundwater decline leading to dry wells in the Bicol River Basin in the Philippines.', 'In 2022, we will further assess challenges at the watershed level, involving community stakeholders as warranted to mitigate risks.', 'Optimizing water As defined by the Alliance for Water Stewardship, a shared water challenge is a water-related issue, concern, or threat shared by the site and one or more stakeholders within the catchment(s).', 'Drawing on our experience and the findings of our risk assessments, we aim to go beyond water management toward water stewardship to tackle shared watershed challenges, leveraging a science-based approach to improve water conditions for beneficiaries across each watershed.', 'We have set a target of optimizing at least 10 million cubic meters of water (cumulative since 2019) in our tobacco-growing areas by 2030 through dedicated projects that address shared water challenges in the watersheds where we operate.', 'To achieve this goal, we plan to generate volumetric water benefits through farm- and landscape-level interventions, leveraging our on-the-ground presence in collaboration with our suppliers and local stakeholders.', 'In 2021, we partnered with the experts of Bluerisk and Valuing Impact to apply the World Resource Institute’s volumetric water benefit accounting (VWBA) methodology to our tobacco supply chain.', 'This allowed us to better understand the potential impacts of water retention interventions, whether positive (e.g., carbon sequestration due to increased soil organic matter) or negative (e.g., increased water withdrawals due to more efficient irrigation systems that may trigger increased evapotranspiration).', 'The projects we undertake range from nature-based solutions to irrigation efficiencies and rainwater collection.', 'For example, in 2021, we modified our farmer footprint in Turkey by supporting farmers in switching their previous crops to tobacco, which requires substantially less irrigation water.', 'This change has helped address competing demand for limited water supplies in the water stressed Aegean Region, reducing by more than 300,000 cubic meters the amount of water withdrawn from the local watershed.', 'The results of this project have contributed to our 2030 volumetric water optimization target.', 'We also trialed irrigation optimization sensors in Italy, leveraging drip irrigation, liquid fertilizers, and the deployment of a decision support system that uses digital technology to ensure the most efficient crop input amounts (of both water and fertilizers).', 'Our goal is to optimize the ratio between crop input and productivity to minimize the use of resources, including water, while maximizing crop yield.', 'Meanwhile in Brazil, many of our farmers have water springs on or near their farms.', 'To maintain water quality and prevent contamination and runoff, we supported them in protecting water points by installing fencing to keep away cattle and prevent contamination.', 'Overall, since 2019, we have already optimized 437,915 cubic meters of water across our tobacco supply chain.', 'When designing projects, we seek to take a holistic approach that aims to both protect natural capital and generate water benefits for local watersheds.', 'Nature- based solutions are proven to bring significantly greater benefits than projects focused solely on reducing water consumption at the farm level.', 'Water quality When misused, crop protection agents (CPAs) and fertilizers can pollute the local environment.', 'While CPAs protect crops and fertilizers improve crop yield, these chemicals can infiltrate groundwater or run off into surface watercourses, impacting aquifers and aquatic ecosystems.', 'We maintain a global integrated pest management program to reduce the unnecessary use of pesticides, promote less hazardous alternatives, and manage both appropriately (read more here).', 'Further, to minimize their negative impact, we promote more efficient ways to apply fertilizers, such as through drip irrigation systems that distribute them in smaller quantities and directly to the plants’ root systems.', 'The interventions of field technicians—who help educate farmers—are key to improving pesticide and fertilizer management.', 'Water stewardship in our operations We have a long-standing approach to driving water stewardship in our direct operations, including our manufacturing sites.', 'Assessing water risks We conduct periodic risk assessments, mapping our factories, offices, and warehouses against the World Resources Institute’s Aqueduct Water Risk Atlas to identify those sites subject to physical water risks.', 'The assessment accounts for: • A criticality evaluation, based on indicators and thresholds that define the criteria for a site to be considered critical for PMI’s business continuity.', '• Water risk scores, based on the results of the WRI Aqueduct Water Risk Atlas.', 'The relevant water risk indicators for PMI were identified according to the type of facility (e.g., factory, warehouse, or office).', 'Following our 2020 assessment results, we kept our focus in 2021 on four factories: three sites in Europe shown to have high criticality and to face risk of drought or water stress and one site in Asia at risk of riverine flooding.', 'Accelerating water-efficiency efforts Manufacturing cigarettes and consumables for our smoke-free products accounts for around 5 percent of our total water footprint and amounted to around 3.12 million cubic meters in 2021 (2020: 3.38 million cubic meters).', 'The production of smoke-free consumables initially was five times more water-intensive than the manufacturing of combusted cigarettes.', 'While the public health benefits of smoke-free products justify the trade-off of increased water intensity, we are accelerating our efforts to mitigate the increased water demand in the manufacturing process through enhanced efficiency.', 'In 2021, we reduced water intensity by 44 percent versus 2018, achieving a ratio of 2.6 cubic meters per million cigarettes equivalent, down from 4.7 in 2018.', 'We continuously work to improve our processes, invest in novel technologies, and raise awareness among our employees.', 'Our Drive 4 Zero program plays a crucial role in improving performance.', 'In 2021, we were able to reduce total water consumption across our manufacturing sites by 8.5 percent despite the continued and significant increase in the production volume of heated tobacco units.', 'Our efforts are bearing fruit: Between 2018 and 2021, we reduced water consumption at our manufacturing sites by 28.6 percent in absolute terms.', '31 local water risk assessments completed in our tobacco supply chain since 2018 Philip Morris International – Integrated Report 2021 186 187 Overview Strategy Operational impact Product impact Fundamentals Reporting and performance', 'Preserve nature Water and wastewater quality Water quality plays a vital role in our operations.', 'At our factories, high-quality fresh water is used in manufacturing processes—including the preparation of flavors and liquid products and the production of smoke-free consumables—for sanitation and hygiene, and for landscape watering.', 'To reduce water dependency in the long term, we are implementing technologies and efficiency initiatives to recycle and reuse water at our manufacturing facilities.', 'These technologies include, for instance, reverse osmosis and electrode ionization.', 'Monitoring wastewater quality is standard procedure at our manufacturing sites.', 'We conduct sampling following recognized protocols to measure standard effluent parameters.', 'Although we conduct some laboratory analysis internally, most is handled externally by accredited labs.', 'Our certified environmental management systems help our sites remain in compliance with current and future statutory and regulatory requirements associated with water discharge.', 'Fostering best practices in water management Certifying our manufacturing sites to the Alliance for Water Stewardship (AWS) standard is a critical component of our approach to water management.', 'The AWS standard is a globally applicable framework that enables organizations to understand their water use and impacts and work collaboratively and transparently with others to achieve sustainable water management within the wider water catchment context.', 'It goes beyond manufacturing to help companies engage with the communities in which they operate.', 'Our goal is to certify all our factories to the AWS standard by 2025, and we are making good progress.', 'In 2021, our sites in Brazil, the Czech Republic, Greece, Indonesia, Italy, Mexico, the Philippines, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Russia, South Korea, Switzerland, Turkey, and Ukraine completed the certification process (or, for those sites that previously had been certified, underwent the annual surveillance audit), bringing the total number of our factories certified since 2018 to 16.', 'Our water risk assessments guide our certification timelines and levels of ambition.', 'For instance, we achieved Platinum AWS certification for our factory in Brazil, which is located in the same catchment area as our smallholder tobacco farmers in Rio Pardo and Taquari-Antas.', 'During 2021, we launched a new project to analyze groundwater quality because it was found to have a naturally high concentration of fluoride, affecting drinking water.', 'To reduce the fluoride concentration, we collaborated with the local university to develop a green filter based on World Health Organization literature and test it at farmers’ homes.', 'The project, which is still ongoing, has more than six months of proven efficacy and was presented at the annual conference of the Brazilian Chemical Society.', 'Between 2019 and 2021, we also invested in developing our internal capabilities to accelerate the rollout of the AWS program across our factories, accrediting close to 50 employees as internal AWS auditors through the AWS specialist training from the SGS Academy.', 'Reducing waste Adequate waste management creates efficiencies and allows for better use of finite resources.', 'We follow the waste hierarchy, whereby we aim first to reduce the waste we generate, promote its reuse and recycling whenever possible, incinerate it when this is the best option available, and, to the extent possible, avoid adding to landfill.', 'Managing the waste generated in our operations We are committed to reducing the waste generated by our operations and to identifying and applying the most sustainable waste treatment options available.', 'We manage all waste from our production sites, including waste from catering, rest areas, laboratories, and healthcare facilities.', 'We pay special attention to our most valuable waste streams, such as tobacco, paper, card, and cellulose acetate tow, and to hazardous waste, such as oils, lubricants, flavor residues, paints, solvents, chemicals such as nicotine from laboratories, and activated carbon filters.', 'We apply a comprehensive approach to waste management: Avoid and reduce: A core focus of our strategy is to reduce the amount of waste generated by converting raw materials into products as efficiently as possible.', 'In 2021, we generated a total of 114,043 tons of waste, of which 1 percent was hazardous.', 'This is 17 percent less waste generated than in 2020 and 29 percent less than in 2019.', 'We also strive to eliminate or reduce waste at the source; for instance, by requiring suppliers to use returnable pallets and containers when delivering materials to our sites.', 'With improvements to our lean manufacturing processes and our continuous focus on loss elimination, we have been able to reduce the waste generated in production consistently.', 'Reuse and recycle: In parallel to optimizing our processes to cut waste, we strive to responsibly manage the waste we do generate.', 'We first seek to reuse materials ourselves or make them available to others, extending their lifetimes within the circular economy.', 'For instance, we use organic waste generated by our factory in Italy (e.g., food waste from the canteen) to produce compost, which we then apply as fertilizer to the green areas surrounding the site.', 'We do not count the materials reused by others as waste because this reuse helps reduce the consumption of natural resources in other industries.', 'Another path is recycling, which currently represents most of our waste disposal (87 percent in 2021).', 'This includes segregating waste into paper, plastics, metals, and glass and often selling these materials to recycling companies so they can be turned into new products.', 'Recover: When recycling is not possible, we seek to recover waste materials and use them to generate energy.', 'In 2021, 11 percent of the waste generated was incinerated with energy recovery, while only 1.', '4 percent was incinerated without energy recovery or disposed in a landfill.', 'Employee engagement is a critical driver in helping us to use less and reuse and recycle materials wherever we can.', 'Our Drive 4 Zero program empowers employees to identify and implement improvement opportunities for waste reduction.', 'Disposal of waste generated in 2021 C A S E S T U DY Water stewardship in the Philippines In 2021, our manufacturing site in

for zero waste to landfill in our factories We apply a “zero waste” philosophy, but we acknowledge that even the most efficient systems inevitably involve a small amount of landfill; for instance, waste-to-energy ash residue, waste legally mandated for landfill, and greywater sludge.', 'Therefore, our ambition is for our sites to achieve a landfill diversion rate of 99 percent or greater.1 In 2021, we achieved virtually zero production waste to landfill globally, with a total of 1,232 tons of production waste disposed to landfill (representing a reduction of 77 percent compared with the close to 5,375 tons in 2019).', 'We aim to achieve virtually zero waste to landfill across each PMI manufacturing site by year-end 2022 while complying with all relevant waste regulations and standards.', 'By the end of 2021, 83 percent of our factories had achieved virtually zero waste to landfill.', 'We now are focused on the remaining sites to achieve our 2022 ambition.', 'All our manufacturing sites have annual waste targets supported by specific projects to ensure their delivery.', 'Fostering responsible waste practices in our supply chain Beyond our operations, we seek to foster a positive impact on waste practices in our supply chain, particularly in our tobacco supply chain.', 'Our Good Agricultural Practices require that suppliers have waste management plans in place.', 'In addition to being compliant with relevant laws and regulations, these plans should incorporate identification of waste sources, improvement measures, recycling programs, risk mitigation, and communication with farmers regarding waste classification, storage, recycling, and disposal.', 'Further, we expect our tobacco suppliers to dispose of empty agrochemical containers safely and appropriately.', 'In some countries, we provide additional support to ensure the collection and proper disposal of containers that held pesticides or crop protection agents.', 'In Indonesia, for instance, we partnered with local stakeholders and Plastic Collective in 2021 to support the setup of a recycling center for other types of plastic waste in rural communities.', 'The project relies on a recycling hub with 20 collection centers to provide a model for local community plastics recycling.', 'The aim is to recycle over 80 percent of single-use plastics in the communities where the project is implemented, and to reduce environmental pollution by supporting these farming communities with education and economic incentives to participate.', 'The initiative was launched in early November; in its first 30 days of collection, around 3.7 tons of single-use waste plastic was collected by community members.', 'Preserving natural ecosystems We strive to reduce the negative impacts of our operations and sourcing activities on habitats and ecosystems while looking for ways to contribute to the diversity of plant and animal life.', 'Joining forces to protect biodiversity We believe companies have a critical role to play in tackling biodiversity loss by promoting conservation in partnership with both international organizations driving for global ambitions and local stakeholders who understand their surroundings and experience effects on the ground.', 'We participate in international forums such as CSR Europe’s Biodiversity & Industry Platform, WBCSD’s working groups on nature and forests, and Business for Nature, and we leverage the work of the Science Based Targets Network (SBTN).', 'As of 2021, we also participate in the member forum of the TNFD, providing support and contributing to collective action.', 'We call on governments to adopt a common and ambitious framework during the 15th meeting of the Conference of the Parties (COP15) to the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) to set the stage for worldwide action on biodiversity.', 'Designing a holistic biodiversity strategy We understand that building a meaningful global approach to biodiversity requires the conscious cross-pollination of various strategies and interventions.', 'The combined effects of nature degradation, climate change, water scarcity, and forest loss—among other factors—are creating a biodiversity crisis.', 'To respond appropriately to this crisis, we must account for the synergies and interdependencies of environmental impacts along our value chain and put biodiversity protection at the nexus of our climate, forest, and water strategies.', 'Over the past couple of years, we have focused on gaining visibility into and an understanding of our impacts on biodiversity.', 'Leveraging the application of the Mean Species Abundance (MSA) metric in our 2019 assessment, CSR Europe’s 2020 evaluation on the maturity of biodiversity practices, and our own datasets and expertise, we identified the following priority areas along our value chain: • In our tobacco supply chain, our focus should be on the tobacco cultivation process, which carries risks related to degradation of the natural environment linked to loss of ecosystem area, chemical pollution, and invasive species.', '• In our non-tobacco supply chain, emphasis needs to be put on the deforestation risks linked to the sourcing of paper and pulp-based materials.', '• In our direct operations, attention should be paid to the proximity of our sites to protected and key biodiversity areas and the implementation of good environmental practices at manufacturing sites.', '• Downstream in our value chain, we should concentrate on preventing the littering of our product consumables.', 'Biodiversity stewardship in our tobacco supply chain In 2021, we partnered with the Biodiversity Consultancy to identify the main dependencies and impacts related to our tobacco leaf supply chain.', 'Our aim was to align strategy development with the SBTN approach to set interim targets that have measurable, actionable, time-bound objectives that will be revised once the global goals for nature have been formally set by the Convention on Biological Diversity COP.', 'As a first step, we assessed the programs currently in place to deliver on biodiversity.', 'These include our Good Agricultural Practices program, integrated pest management program, Zero Deforestation Manifesto, renewable curing fuels program, and water stewardship efforts in addition to locally run biodiversity projects such as our diagnostic tool for environmental protection at farm level in Brazil.', 'We then focused on deepening our understanding of our tobacco supply chain from a biodiversity standpoint, evaluating its extent and the types of ecosystem it involves.', '1 Our calculation of zero waste to landfill does not include canteen and sanitary waste, which do not relate to our production processes.', 'It also excludes the mandated waste, generally tobacco, that we are obliged to landfill to respect local regulations.', 'Total landfilled waste (tons) 3,067 2021 2020 2019 326 4,944 Philip Morris

dependencies and potential impacts across land use, agricultural practices, water consumption, and forest protection.', 'This allowed us to scope the areas of application of our strategy, which we expect to cover land occupancy, ecosystem conversion, water stewardship, climate change, chemical pressure, and invasive species.', 'Toward the end of the year, we also started piloting various measurement instruments.', 'In particular, we applied the Integrated Biodiversity Assessment Tool (IBAT)—including the Species Threat Abatement and Recovery (STAR) metric—and combined it with our spatial footprinting to draw preliminary insights to guide us in our selection of meaningful indicators and targets moving forward.', 'Integrated pest management program Our Good Agricultural Practices and integrated pest management (IPM) program aim to protect both the environment and farmers’ health and safety.', 'Improving crop productivity creates value for farmers and for PMI.', 'Using less surface area to grow the same amount of tobacco can free up land for food crops, other income-generating activities, and, potentially, biodiversity conservation habitats.', 'Under our IPM, pests and diseases are controlled by a set of cultivation practices that include, as a last resort, the correct and safe application of crop protection agents.', 'These practices promote healthy crops and safeguard biodiversity on farms and in surrounding areas.', 'We have implemented IPM plans in our main tobacco-sourcing areas and provide toolkits that help farming communities identify and implement appropriate protection practices.', 'In certain areas, we have developed models that can predict outbreaks of particular pests and diseases, helping farmers to understand when the use of CPAs is strictly necessary.', 'As an example, a decision support system was made available to tobacco farmers and field technicians in Italy to help prevent and manage pest and disease outbreaks.', 'The system helps the decision process by integrating data from forecast models, crop scouting, and remote sensing (satellite images).', 'It is currently used by more than 100 farmers covering a surface of 3,000 hectares, all mapped and digitalized.', 'Looking ahead We are dedicated to setting very solid foundations for our biodiversity approach to be best positioned to drive progress in a complex area.', 'We will further develop our biodiversity strategy, covering all relevant areas of the company and its integration within our climate, water, forest, and waste reduction efforts.', 'Noting the relevance that biodiversity and water have in our overall climate strategy and aims to preserve nature, we look forward to introducing 2025 targets that reflect our level of ambition.', 'We expect to have a full set of targets and actionable milestones by the end of 2022.', 'Massimo Andolina, Senior Vice President, Operations It leverages a network of 17 weather stations located in the tobacco-growing areas to maximize the precision and reliability of pest forecasting models.', 'The tool increased farmers’ awareness of IPM and helped them optimize their use of agrochemicals.', 'Further, we have started to proactively promote the use of biological compounds instead of chemical CPAs and are exploring the use of beneficial insects as natural enemies.', 'As an example, among the various IPM strategies adopted in our tobacco supply chain in Brazil, drones are used to release the insect Trichogramma pretiosum over tobacco fields.', 'Trichogramma are a natural enemy of tobacco Lepidoptera pests.', 'Over a billion of these insects were released in 2021, helping to keep crop-damaging pests under control.', 'Across our supply chain, PMI prohibits the use of CPAs classified by the World Health Organization as Toxicity class I and permits those in class II in well-justified cases only.', 'We achieved our target of eliminating the purchase of tobacco that contains residues indicating the use of highly hazardous pesticides by crop year 2020 (on which we are reporting in this 2021 report).', 'Genetically modified tobacco In line with our GAP principles, genetically modified (GM) tobacco is not acceptable to PMI.', 'We have solid programs in place to avoid the inadvertent introduction of GM tobacco into the products we commercialize.', 'Specifically, we require that each lot of tobacco seeds used to produce crops destined for PMI be systematically sampled and tested to ensure no GM tobacco is grown for our company.', 'Specialized laboratories analyze the seeds sent by all our tobacco suppliers and provide the results directly to both PMI and the suppliers.', 'Additionally, once the tobacco is grown and prior to purchase, we have each lot of tobacco tested—by the same specialized labs—to ensure it has not been genetically modified.', 'If any GM tobacco is detected, the lot is rejected and does not enter PMI’s supply chain.', 'We will continue delivering on our ambition to achieve a deforestation-free supply chain.', 'In our tobacco supply chain, we plan to become forest positive, leveraging initiatives linked to nature-based solutions and providing multiple benefits to support ecosystem restoration and enhancement.', 'In 2022, in accordance with our Zero Deforestation Manifesto commitments, we will expand the scope of our engagement with our paper and pulp-based materials suppliers, encompassing all secondary pulp- based product categories and suppliers.', 'We plan to certify five additional factories to the AWS standard in 2022 and to continue enhancing water efficiency and preserving water quality in our manufacturing sites.', 'In our tobacco supply chain, we will continue to deploy our new optimization strategy to identify the most meaningful interventions, guided by our science-based approach.', 'Our 10 million cubic meter target is a measure of progress that illustrates much more: strong stakeholder engagement at the watershed level and a deep understanding of, and commitment to, acting on shared water challenges with a forward-looking interpretation of water needs.', 'We are focused

uptake, people tend wrongly to attribute all the dangers of smoking to nicotine.', 'While nicotine is addictive and not risk- free, it is not the primary cause of smoking-related diseases.', 'These diseases primarily are associated with chronic exposure to the high level of toxic substances emitted in the smoke when tobacco is burned.', 'In fact, nicotine is a key ingredient in nicotine

Morris International – Integrated Report 2021 200 201 Overview Strategy Operational impact Product impact Fundamentals Reporting and performance', 'Fundamentals Our approach Nicotine plays a key role in the successful adoption of our smoke-free products.', 'Its presence can help adults who would otherwise continue smoking to switch to less risky alternatives instead.', 'In addition to taste, ritual, and the sensory aspects, nicotine uptake that is comparable to cigarettes is important for adult smokers to accept novel alternatives to smoking.', 'Taking these aspects into consideration, we have researched and continue to develop a portfolio of smoke-free products that are a better choice for adult smokers than continuing to smoke cigarettes.', 'We are working hard to achieve a future without cigarettes.', 'As society progresses toward the elimination of cigarettes, the most harmful form of nicotine delivery, there needs to also be education and a societal debate about nicotine that is grounded in science.', 'The world will certainly be a better place without cigarettes, but it is difficult to envision how to achieve this in a timely manner without nicotine-containing alternatives that deliver an acceptable sensory experience.', 'Analyzing the risks and potential benefits of nicotine use What is nicotine?', 'Nicotine occurs naturally in tobacco and, at significantly lower levels, in some other plant varieties from the Solanaceae family, which includes tomatoes, potatoes, and eggplant.', 'It is possible to extract nicotine from tobacco, as is done to derive the nicotine contained in nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) products and e-liquids for e-cigarettes.', 'It is also possible to produce synthetic nicotine.', 'While this process is relatively costly, there are an increasing number of products (e-liquids and nicotine pouches) that are now using synthetic nicotine.', 'The route of nicotine administration (e.g., via the lung, mouth, or skin) influences the speed and amount of nicotine uptake into the body.', 'When tobacco smoke or e-cigarette aerosol is inhaled into the lung, it is rapidly absorbed into the bloodstream and can reach the brain as quickly as 10–20 seconds after the puff is taken.', 'Nicotine from oral tobacco products (e.g., snus, nicotine pouches, NRT gum) is absorbed into the bloodstream through oral tissues, and the nicotine concentration in the blood rises gradually, reaching a plateau in about 30 minutes.', 'The rise in brain nicotine concentration is slower compared with the inhalation route.', 'A certain amount of the orally administered nicotine is swallowed and absorbed, mostly in the small intestine, before passing to the liver, where it is metabolized (i.e., transformed to facilitate excretion of nicotine from the body).', 'Nicotine, when absorbed through the skin, reaches a plateau concentration in the blood more slowly than via other routes of administration.', 'However, the level typically is maintained for a longer period.', 'Once nicotine is absorbed into the circulatory system, it is distributed to all body tissues and organs, including the brain.', 'There, nicotine binds to specific receptor molecules, mimicking the actions of a naturally occurring brain chemical, the neurotransmitter acetylcholine.', 'Nicotine is metabolized mainly in the liver.', 'Nicotine absorbed via the lung and oral tissues reaches the brain directly without first passing through the liver to be metabolized, whereas nicotine absorbed via the gut passes first through the liver to be metabolized and is partially excreted before reaching the brain.', 'In this domain, we are acting on three axes: 1.', 'We continue to analyze the risks and potential benefits of nicotine use when not in combination with combusted tobacco and share our findings to encourage a science-based debate on this important societal question.', 'More information can be found in our eighth Scientific Update, which is dedicated to a review of nicotine.', '2.', 'We understand the need for, and actively work toward, commercializing tobacco and other nicotine-containing products responsibly.', 'We aim to guard against marketing and sales of our smoke-free products to nonsmokers and minimize access for underage purchasers.', 'Our commercialization practices support this business vision: To make adult smokers aware that better alternatives to cigarettes exist and to move those who otherwise would not quit cigarettes to our smoke-free products.', 'Doing this responsibly by directing our marketing and sales activities toward adult smokers and providing them with accurate and relevant information about our products is fundamental to our long-term success.', 'Read more about our sales and marketing practices here.', '3.', 'We conduct post-market studies to understand how our products are used and by whom.', 'Such studies verify the results of our premarket perception and behavior assessments and monitor whether current adult smokers switch to the products, as well as whether never or former smokers use them.', 'By conducting post-market studies, we are able to evaluate potential changes in prevalence; assess initiation, relapse, and complete-quit rates; and compare the use of cigarettes and smoke-free products.', 'Nicotine and addiction Nicotine is an addictive chemical compound present in tobacco and tobacco products.', 'But the addictive properties of smoking involve a more complex interaction of factors than nicotine alone.', 'Ritual, the sensory experience, and social experiences also play a significant role in addiction.', 'Exposure to nicotine and the extent of its effects can also be influenced by individual differences in smoking behavior, metabolism, body mass, and genetics.', 'Continual use of nicotine may lead to dependence or physiological adaptations to maintain homeostasis, which are most evident in the emergence of withdrawal symptoms experienced during cessation.', 'In addition to other physiological responses, long-term use of nicotine can induce changes in the brain’s reward and stress systems, which may manifest as anxiety, dysphoria, and other negative affect states during long-term withdrawal.', 'Physiological dependence, coupled with altered responses from the reward and stress system, can make quitting very difficult.', 'The rapid uptake and delivery of nicotine to the brain’s reward system via lung delivery is thought to be a primary reason for the addictive potential of cigarettes and other inhaled tobacco products.', 'When someone smokes a cigarette, the nicotine levels peak quickly (in about six to 10 minutes), and then the level of nicotine drops fairly rapidly as it is metabolized.', 'Most nicotine replacement therapies do not provide this same pharmacokinetic profile, making them less likely to be addictive but also less likely to satisfy smokers.', 'Two critical factors are the dose and rate of nicotine delivery.', 'NRTs and other cessation products can help address nicotine withdrawal symptoms.', 'The use of NRTs is recommended for eight to 12 weeks, although use for six months or longer may be necessary to achieve optimal quit rates.', 'It makes sense to use NRTs to support smoking cessation for as long as the individual feels at risk of relapse.', 'NRTs, however, are not as satisfying as cigarette smoking.', 'Firstly, they do not provide the ritual, sensory experience, and social components that complete the experience of consuming nicotine via smoking.', 'Secondly, the route and speed of absorption of nicotine is different: Often, the NRTs that rapidly deliver high doses of nicotine, such as sprays and inhalators, are more satisfying to smokers than are those that slowly deliver nicotine at much lower doses, such as gums and patches.', 'Philip Morris International – Integrated Report 2021 202 203 Overview Strategy Operational impact Product impact Fundamentals Reporting and performance', 'Fundamentals Nicotine in our heat-not-burn product For adult smokers who would otherwise continue to smoke, scientific innovation provides increasingly better ways to deliver nicotine while preserving the perceived benefits and enjoyment for the consumer.', 'Nicotine delivery from smoke-free products can resemble that of a cigarette; thus, these devices tend to be much more satisfying for those switching to a less harmful substitute to cigarette smoking.', 'Our IQOS heat-not-burn product is a smoke-free alternative for adult smokers who would otherwise continue smoking and is not a smoking cessation product.', 'Nicotine plays an important role in encouraging adult smokers to switch from cigarettes to better alternatives such as IQOS.', 'Therefore, it is important for IQOS to have a nicotine delivery profile similar to that of a cigarette.', 'In two studies conducted in Japan, the peak concentration of nicotine in the blood occurred about six minutes after starting IQOS use and reached more than 88 percent of the level attained with cigarettes.', 'It, therefore, has an addictive potential similar to cigarettes.', 'But at the same time, IQOS has the potential to be a satisfying alternative to continued smoking, the most harmful form of nicotine consumption.', 'We conduct business ethically and with integrity.', 'We clearly define the ethical and compliance expectations we have for ourselves and for the third parties with whom we work, and we back up these expectations with governance and management systems to ensure we deliver on them.', 'Managing ethics is an integral part of any successful business operation, and major decisions that affect a company’s bottom line often involve questions of ethics.', 'We all depend on systems that apply laws fairly and protect fundamental rights.', 'Without the rule of law, it is difficult for companies to operate successfully.', 'Issues such as corruption, unfair competition, and unsafe workplaces undermine societal well-being.', 'While following the rules is critical, it is sometimes not enough.', 'It can be possible to behave unethically even while complying with the law or other rules.', 'Good ethical judgment helps us guard against such failures and build lasting business success.', 'After reviewing the scientific package on IQOS, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) concluded, “[Pharmacokinetic] studies show Marlboro, Smooth Menthol, and Fresh Menthol Heatsticks have nicotine delivery, addiction potential, and abuse liability similar to combusted cigarettes.', 'This is potentially beneficial for smokers trying to switch to IQOS as they are more likely to have satisfactory results and not resume [combusted cigarette] smoking.”2 Therapeutic delivery of nicotine The public health and scientific communities continue to explore ways in which nicotine, when isolated, can be used as a potential therapeutic compound.3 Scientists are studying nicotine as a possible active ingredient in pharmaceutical applications for the treatment of certain disease states as it could confer specific health benefits.', 'These include treatments for patients suffering from schizophrenia, depression, and anxiety disorders.', 'Scientists are also studying the effects of nicotine on debilitating diseases and disorders such as Tourette’s, Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and others.', 'We believe a greater societal focus on the health impact of nicotine in isolation is needed, and we plan to play our part in furthering this understanding through our research.', 'Our approach We understand that PMI’s reputation comes from the sum of our actions.', 'To ensure we conduct business ethically and with integrity, we maintain an Ethics & Compliance (E&C) program.', 'The program is led by our Vice President and Chief Ethics & Compliance Officer, who reports to PMI’s General Counsel and also reports periodically to the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors.', 'Our Guidebook for Success (PMI’s code of conduct) sets clear standards and expectations.', 'Its mandatory provisions apply to all PMI employees, officers, and directors.', 'Key risk areas addressed in this document include anti-bribery and anti-corruption, anti-competitive practices, conflicts of interest, information protection security and data privacy, responsible marketing and sales, scientific integrity, supply chain responsibility, and workplace integrity.', 'Internal policies—called Principles & Practices— provide more-specific guidance on these topics.', 'Evaluating our Ethics & Compliance culture We formally evaluate our E&C culture periodically, using a global online survey to understand employee experiences and attitudes related to ethical business conduct.', 'For the last 15 years, PMI has been surveying its global employee population every two to three years, including most recently in September 2021.', 'According to the 2021 E&C survey results, PMI is stronger on ethics than at the time of the 2018 survey.', 'The global survey results showed improved or maintained performance across all categories of questions.', 'Most notably, we saw very high awareness among respondents of the company’s E&C program, our Guidebook for Success, our compliance helpline, and the duty to speak up should concerns arise.', 'Analyzing the survey results helps us identify potential improvement opportunities.', 'Current focus areas include reinforcing the importance of employees speaking up when they observe

implemented to address investigation findings, and disciplinary actions are calibrated against past actions to keep the process fair.', 'When investigating suspected E&C violations, trained personnel adhere to PMI Investigations Standards, which are designed to ensure a fair and respectful process.', 'We run a post-investigation quality assurance program to get feedback on how well we met these standards.', 'We also have a Retaliation Check program to detect, remedy, and prevent retaliation against people who speak up, which includes regular follow-ups with employees who have made a report.', 'We also run checks to ensure year-end performance assessments are fair, and we review substantial employment decisions regarding all people identified as at risk of retaliation before the decisions are implemented.', 'We received 929 reports of suspected misconduct in 2021 (2020: 762).', 'Around 43 percent of the matters that were closed in 2021 did not involve a compliance allegation and were resolved through E&C advisory services or referred to line management or appropriate departments, such as our People & Culture teams, for further action.', 'In 2021, we investigated and closed 508 cases that involved potential violations of PMI’s Guidebook for Success and compliance policies (2020: 431).', 'At least one violation was substantiated in 46 percent of these cases (2020: 54 percent), with “theft and fraud” accounting for 30 percent of all violations (2020: 22 percent), “workplace integrity” accounting for 22 percent (2020: 30 percent), and violations related to speaking up (such as failure to speak up or obstructing an investigation) accounting for 14 percent (2020: 20 percent).', 'Corrective measures and disciplinary sanctions were implemented following these investigations.', 'Specifically, in 2021, termination of employment accounted for 26 percent of the disciplinary actions issued from these cases, while suspension accounted for 5 percent, written warning for 32 percent, and verbal warning or counseling for the remaining 27 percent.', 'There is a strong speaking-up culture at PMI, with most employees communicating directly with the E&C department and disclosing their identity when speaking up.', 'Specifically, in 2021, only 22 percent of the reports received by E&C were submitted anonymously.', 'According to the 2021 E&C results, the vast majority of employees are aware of PMI’s anonymous reporting channels and do not fear retaliation for reporting potential misconduct.', 'These statistics indicate that employees feel comfortable speaking up and sharing their names.', 'In addition, the E&C team continues to increase its outreach to employees on PMI’s speaking- up program.', 'As part of our Inside E&C initiative, for example, the department shares quarterly statistics with employees globally about speaking-up reports, compliance violations, and disciplinary actions, as well as anonymized real-life examples of misconduct and advisory guidance provided in response to employee questions.', 'Furthermore, in 2021, E&C launched the #UnmuteYourself campaign to encourage speaking up across all regions.', 'The initiative was championed by members of the Company Management team and resulted in management teams and employees across PMI regularly referring to speaking up during business calls.', '1 As of 2021

farmers to achieve a solid economic performance and tangible environmental and social improvements.', 'Our approach to sustainable supply chain management is built on the following core principles: • Proactive engagement is key to fostering open and transparent relationships with our suppliers in which expertise is shared and built together.', '• We take a risk-based approach, deploying tailored tools and interventions and prioritizing areas in which we can have the greatest impact.', '• We seek to support our suppliers in continuously improving their sustainability performance and achieving the highest standards of compliance.', '• We leverage our reach and understanding of our supply base to implement impactful programs and accelerate progress in our sustainability corridors, such as our efforts to tackle climate change, protect nature, and promote fair working conditions.', 'Our supply chain sustainability strategy is grounded in our Responsible Sourcing Principles (RSP), which align with the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights (UNGPs), the Ten Principles of the UN Global Compact, and International Labour Organization (ILO) Conventions.', 'The RSP, together with its corresponding Implementation Guidance, detail our ambitions and set process and performance standards for our suppliers of materials and services, from the direct materials used in manufacturing our products to the goods and services required to run our business.', 'We expect all our suppliers—and in particular our critical suppliers—to demonstrate high sustainability performance and compliance with the expectations of our RSP and Good Agricultural Practices (GAP).', 'And we have set a commitment to source sustainably from all our critical suppliers by 2025.', 'Adherence to our RSP—and GAP for our tobacco supply chain—is built into our contractual agreements with suppliers.', 'We monitor the activities of our critical suppliers through a suite of tools, including third- party assessments, on-site audits, and field visits.', 'Manage our supply chain sustainably Empowering our low- and medium-risk countries to assess human rights impacts To ensure all countries are assessed, not just those at highest risk, we piloted a new type of HRIA process and toolkit in 2021 aimed at enabling our medium- and low-risk country affiliates to self- identify salient human rights risks in their markets and develop action plans to address them.', 'The tool was piloted in our Benelux market (Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg), with a focus on identifying human rights risks before they could have a significant adverse impact.', 'The Benelux team developed a practical action plan with short-term objectives that allowed it to meet and exceed evolving standards and stakeholder expectations across all three markets.', 'Our affiliate in Mexico also participated in the pilot phase of the human rights self-assessments.', 'This exercise had a two-fold objective: To account for potential risks related to the pandemic and to evaluate the status and progress of the action plan implementation following the 2018 HRIA (read more here).', 'The self-assessment in 2021 confirmed that we had strengthened our practices across all areas identified in 2018.', 'Moreover, engagement with external and internal stakeholders shed light on the need to focus on three additional topics: (1) protecting employees’ work–life balance while working from home; (2) promoting equal conditions for women and men, considering that women are often responsible for childcare; and (3) supporting employees’ mental health.', 'We will fine-tune our self-assessment toolkit with learnings from these pilots prior to rolling it out more broadly in the second half of 2022.', 'Exploring climate justice—the intersection of human rights and climate change We recognize that climate change impacts not just the environment but also people’s economic and social well-being.', 'Climate change has exacerbated human rights issues and disproportionately affects the most vulnerable people around the world.', 'In 2021, we commissioned a briefing paper (available here), prepared by our human rights advisers Article One, to explore where and how the issues of climate change and human rights intersect in the agricultural supply chain.', 'This is an essential step in developing coherent and inclusive strategies across our supply chain to help mitigate the impacts of climate change.', 'Grievance mechanisms Providing access to effective grievance mechanisms in our operations and across our supply chain is a key requirement of the UNGPs and a core element of our due diligence approach.', 'Internally, we maintain clear policies, run regular training, and work to ensure that robust processes are in place to encourage employees to speak up if things don’t seem right or can be improved (read more here).', 'The same applies to our supply chain, where our Responsible Sourcing Principles (RSP) specifically ask suppliers to provide their workers with easily accessible ways to raise concerns, free from risk of retaliation.', 'In our tobacco supply chain, our Agricultural Labor Practices (ALP) Code states: “Workers should have access to a fair, transparent, and anonymous grievance mechanism.” Such mechanisms are available in some countries where we source tobacco and concerns can be raised with field technicians at any time.', 'We continue to review and look for opportunities to strengthen further the grievance mechanisms that exist in our operations and value chain.', 'Looking ahead We remain committed to respecting and promoting human rights across our value chain.', 'In 2022, we plan to review our Commitment to Human Rights to identify potential opportunities to strengthen it.', 'We will also translate our human rights e-learning into additional languages spoken at PMI to roll it out further across our organization.', 'We plan to complete our HRIA in Malaysia, expanding it to assess downstream impacts, and we expect to conduct an HRIA in one additional market in 2022.', 'In addition, we will fine-tune our human rights

increase in the proportion of resources allocated to smoke-free products versus combustible cigarettes (smoke-free products accounted for 35 percent of our supply chain spend in 2021, up from 33 percent in 2020).', 'From a sustainability standpoint, the supply chain categories exposed to the highest risks pertain to our direct spend and include: • Tobacco production across Africa, Asia, and South America, with the main risks in the areas of working conditions, child labor, climate change, access to water, and the socioeconomic well-being of farming communities • Electronics manufacturing, with the main risks relating to working conditions • Paper and pulp-based materials, with the main risks linked to deforestation, biodiversity loss, and climate change.', 'During the year, the supply of direct materials has been under pressure due to high demand for primary commodities, a global transportation shortage, congestion, and cost inflation, mainly driven by energy prices.', 'Thanks to robust business contingency plans and the efforts of our Operations team, we have been able to manage shortages to ensure stable production in our manufacturing centers.', 'We have also expanded our supply base to secure additional supplies and mitigate the impact of inflation.', 'Regrettably, the prolonged impact of the global semiconductor shortage limited our ability to realize the full potential of IQOS development and growth in 2021.', 'Monitoring the sustainability performance of our critical suppliers Increasing the visibility of our suppliers’ sustainability performance and implementing risk mitigation and performance improvement measures are priorities.', 'In recent years, we have taken critical steps to achieve and deploy tailored due diligence instruments across our direct materials, electronics, and tobacco supply chains.', 'Our efforts have translated into significant progress toward our 2025 ambition: During 2021, 83 percent of our critical supplier spend was sourced sustainably.', 'Sustainable sourcing is determined based on a minimum threshold score of 45 out of 100 in EcoVadis (for suppliers of direct materials) or 125 out of 200 in RBA (for electronics suppliers); all tobacco purchased from contracted farmers under the integrated production system is considered to be sustainable.', 'Critical suppliers are those that manufacture or sell components used in the manufacture of PMI finished products (including direct materials, electronic devices and accessories, and tobacco leaf).', 'In addition to the nature of the component, supplier’s criticality is evaluated considering spend segmentation, as well as supply flexibility, as relevant.', 'Direct materials supply chain To strengthen our approach in 2021 further, Procurement successfully transitioned our nonelectronics supplier due diligence program to EcoVadis, the leading global service provider of online ESG supplier assessments.', 'This partnership allows PMI to access a vast number of suppliers’ ESG scorecards commissioned by EcoVadis users (leading global companies across industries).', 'During the year, 87 suppliers representing 90 percent of our total direct material spend (excluding tobacco and electronics) were assessed.', 'Of them, 82 percent demonstrated a high sustainability performance and compliance with our RSP, 18 percent were below the compliance level and required to complete a corrective action plan before doing a reassessment in 2022, and only one supplier will require an on-site audit to be conducted in 2022.', 'The areas for improvement mainly related to labor and human rights, followed by environment, ethics, and sustainable procurement.', 'We apply tailored due diligence instruments and mechanisms within specific segments of our supply chain.', 'In our tobacco supply chain, our work is governed by GAP and our Agricultural Labor Practices (ALP) Code, which are operationalized at farm level by field technicians working year-round with the farmers contracted by PMI and our suppliers.', 'Our Procurement organization leverages the work of the Responsible Business Alliance (RBA)—the parent organization of the

standard for on-site compliance verification and effective, shareable audits.', 'Under the program, independent external auditors reviewed our electronics suppliers’ sustainability performance against our RSP.', 'In all, the RBA digital platform afforded us access to 31 RBA VAP audit reports covering tier 1 and tier 2 suppliers representing 69 percent of our managed electronics supply chain spend.', 'The initial average VAP audit score of our suppliers was 160 out of 200 compared with an RBA average of 127.', 'In 2022, we aim to achieve higher spend coverage of the RBA audit program to monitor PMI-managed suppliers and ensure concrete corrective actions are in place where needed.', 'Conflict minerals In certain conflict-affected and high-risk parts of the world, four minerals used in consumer goods—tin, tantalum, tungsten, and gold (3TGs)— are sometimes mined using forced labor and used to finance armed conflict.', 'As a result, they have become known as “conflict minerals.” Companies are expected to demonstrate how they respect human rights and avoid contributing to conflict in their mineral-purchasing decisions and practices.', 'Our 2021 conflict minerals submission to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, covering the year ended December 31, 2020, showed that the smelters from which our suppliers source 3TGs for our Covered Products (as defined in the submission) were either conformant with the Responsible Minerals Initiative audit program (244 smelters) or were undergoing the assessment process (12 smelters).', 'Another mineral, cobalt, is also linked to unethical mining practices.', 'It is a critical raw material in the production of the batteries used in our smoke-free products.', 'While the quantities of cobalt required for our products are minor compared with the total global market size, since 2019 we have deployed a due diligence program based on the RMI approach and tools to identify and address potential human rights risks in the supply chains of our suppliers.', 'In 2021, all our battery suppliers fulfilled specific reporting requirements, including furnishing information on the smelters from which they source cobalt.', 'Subsequent due diligence deploying additional RMI tools indicated that, as of December 31, 2021, each of the 15 smelters from which PMI battery suppliers source cobalt were on either RMI’s conformant list (11 smelters) or active list (4 smelters).', 'Tobacco supply chain PMI defines sustainable tobacco production as the efficient and competitive production of quality tobacco in conditions that limit as much as possible the impact on the natural environment and improve the socioeconomic condition of the people and communities involved in its production.', 'PMI’s Good Agricultural Practices In our tobacco supply chain, production adheres to our GAP, which define the principles and measurable standards to be met by all those who grow and supply tobacco to PMI.', 'GAP focuses on four areas: governance, crop, environment, and people.', 'The latter is governed by a dedicated ALP Code.', 'GAP is mandatory for all suppliers of tobacco to PMI and is reflected in the supply contracts of PMI and its affiliates.', 'Whether we source tobacco from farmers directly or through third-party suppliers, our GAP standards and related monitoring and remediation system apply at farm level.', 'The absence of a clear commitment to act on issues identified, or a persistent lack of action and improvement, can lead to contractual implications for both farmers and suppliers.', 'PMI also reserves the right to terminate contracts immediately in cases of severe violations impacting people, the crop, or the environment.', 'The fact-based and detailed EcoVadis supplier evaluations help drive continuous improvement in the areas highlighted.', 'These assessments are available on the EcoVadis digital platform, which allows seamless sharing among all supplier and customer participants, creating an effective collaboration ecosystem.', 'To address the identified improvement opportunities, we plan to launch supplier corrective action plans in 2022.', 'This will be followed by reassessments and on- site audits for suppliers that have more gaps to bridge.', 'In 2021, we also leveraged EcoVadis’ broad reach and existing supplier base to assess the sustainability performance of strategic noncritical suppliers in other procurement categories of spend, including indirect materials and services and technical procurement.', 'This allowed us to evaluate suppliers representing 22 percent of our indirect spend.', 'Electronics supply chain In January 2021, we reached a major milestone: joining the RBA, the electronics industry initiative for sustainable supply chains.', 'During our first year of membership, we were able to leverage RBA’s best-in-class methodologies and tools, including members’ audit reports, to enhance significantly the evaluation and performance of our suppliers.', 'To increase their knowledge of best industrial practices and use of RBA tools, we engaged new suppliers in the RBA online training platform.', 'Overview of our electronics supply

supply chain To a large extent, responsible sourcing stems from strong relationships on the ground.', 'PMI’s Integrated Production System (IPS) connects leaf suppliers and farmers beyond the customary boundaries of a commercial relationship and enables direct technical support, agronomic advice, financial loans, and various other services.', 'IPS covered 98 percent of our tobacco purchases in 2021.', 'The excluded purchases took place in Indonesia, where an increase in tobacco demand prompted additional purchases, and in Pakistan, where the gGovernment mandated the purchase of nonallocated surplus volume to absorb unpurchased tobacco left in the market after the buying season was over.', 'IPS is vital in providing traceability and visibility in our supply base; it enables the deployment of our GAP and ALP monitoring and remediation system down to the farm level.', 'At the center of this system are field technicians, employed by PMI or our third-party suppliers, who visit each farm on average five to 10 times during the crop season and monitor how well sustainability requirements are applied and commercial processes are working.', 'They provide agronomic assistance, deliver training to farmers, identify and address labor issues, and ensure the implementation of improvement plans.', 'In 2021, field technicians allowed us to monitor compliance with GAP on all contracted farms.', 'In a few countries facing stringent pandemic- related restrictions, farm visits were adapted and remote support was offered as needed.', 'The monitoring of GAP implementation can also be performed by third parties, such as specialized NGOs.', 'During the year, we expanded our collaboration in Brazil with Produzindo Certo, a specialist company helping farmers operate more efficiently and sustainably.', 'After a successful pilot carried out in 2020 with the participation of 123 farmers (read more in our 2020 Integrated Report), we extended the scope of the program in 2021 to cover nearly 2,300 farmers.', 'Specialists from Produzindo Certo provided each farmer a social and environmental diagnosis of their farm, as well as tailored action plans highlighting opportunities for growth and development.', 'Those farmers who commit to adopting the action plan and implementing its recommendations will be visited annually by Produzindo Certo technicians, who will provide assistance and monitor progress over time.', 'The feedback received so far from the farmers has been very positive.', 'They recognize that following the recommendations of this team of specialists will better prepare them for the future, making their farms more sustainable, productive, and fully compliant with market demands and local legislation.', 'In 2022, the work continues.', 'Philip

and maturity of our programs and the high ambitions we have set to advance socioeconomic conditions in our tobacco supply chain invited us to reflect on what was needed for us to continue making progress.', 'This led us to make the decision to end our participation in the STP as of the end of 2021.', 'This will allow us to better target our resources and efforts to address the most critical challenges we face.', 'We remain dedicated to working closely with our suppliers—who also work with other tobacco manufacturers—to implement meaningful programs.', 'Moreover, we will continue to work

in-market product return and consumer care processes, as well as at the PMI reverse logistics hubs (CIRCLE), allowing us to identify suspected counterfeit devices and remove them from the supply

limited assurance whether anything has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the Business Transformation Metrics Reporting 2021 are not free from material misstatement.', 'Based on risk and materiality considerations, we performed our procedures to obtain sufficient and appropriate assurance evidence.', 'The procedures selected depend on the assurance practitioner’s judgement.', 'A limited assurance engagement under ISAE 3000 (Revised) is substantially less in scope than a reasonable assurance engagement in relation to both the risk assessment procedures, including an understanding of internal control, and the procedures performed in response to the assessed risks.', 'Consequently, the nature, timing and extent of procedures for gathering sufficient appropriate evidence are deliberately limited relative to a reasonable assurance engagement and therefore less assurance is obtained with a limited assurance engagement than for a reasonable assurance engagement.', 'We performed the following procedures, among others: • Interviewing PMI representatives responsible for the internal reporting and data collection.', '• Test samples from PMI operations concerning the completeness, accuracy, consistency and classification.', '• Inspecting relevant documentation on a sample basis, including PMI policies, management reporting structures and documentation.', '• Reviewing and assessing the management reporting processes for Business Transformation Metrics data and consolidation and their related controls.', 'We believe that the evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our conclusion.', 'Conclusion Based on the work we performed, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the specified Key Performance Indicators on the pages 35 and 232, respectively, (the metrics with an asterisk (*)) in the Business Transformation Metrics Reporting 2021 of PMI for the period from January 1, 2021 to December 31, 2021 are not, in all material respects, in accordance with the Business Transformation Framework and the footnotes on pages 35 and 232 as well as in the Glossary (page 248 to 251).', 'Intended users and purpose of the report This report is prepared for, and only for, the Board of Directors of Philip Morris International Inc. and solely for the purpose of reporting to them

LAUDER &\\nFABRIZIO FREDA\\nDear Stakeholders,\\nAt The Estée Lauder Companies, it is our ambition to lead in social impact; sustainability; and inclusion, diversity, and\\nequity. Despite a year of continued challenges related to COVID-19, we remained steadfast in our commitment to these\\nlong-term objectives, while delivering exceptional business results.\\nThis year is deeply significant to us, as it marks the 75th anniversary of The Estée Lauder Companies. The success of\\nour company has long been rooted not only in our business strategy, but in a deep understanding of our core values,\\nincluding respect for the individual, uncompromising ethics and integrity, generosity of spirit, and fearless persistence.\\nAs we look ahead, our responsibility is clear: to act on these values with even more intensity and intention, and to\\naccelerate our commitment to help protect the planet and the health and well-being of our employees, consumers,\\nand the communities in which we live, work, and source.\\n\\n8\\n\\n\\x0c LEADERSHIP LETTERS\\n\\nWe are especially grateful to our employees’ agility, focus, and persistence in helping drive progress\\non our sustainability and social impact goals and inclusion, diversity, and equity commitments, all while\\ncaring for each other, their families, and our company with compassion, creativity, and resolve.\\nFrom the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, we adjusted our operations and developed global protocols\\nto protect the health and safety of our people and our consumers. For example, across the globe, our\\nemployees used more than five million masks to protect themselves and others while working on-site.\\nIn addition, we dedicated our annual Mental Health Awareness Month in May 2021 to highlight\\ninitiatives to help our employees balance work-life and overall well-being. We also provided expanded\\nbenefits to provide support during critical times and assistance with everyday life challenges.\\n\\nADVANCING ON OUR COMMITMENTS\\nRacial Equity and Gender Equality\\nAs the world continues to reckon with social and racial injustices, our global ELC family came together\\nto develop a set of commitments to Racial Equity, as announced in June 2020. We also outlined a new\\nset of commitments to Gender Equality, inclusive of achieving gender pay equity and globally increasing\\nrepresentation of women from underrepresented groups in our workforce. These efforts lay the foundation\\nnot only for a culture of equity and inclusion within our own walls, but also help contribute to advancing\\nequity globally by adding our voice to the dialogue.\\nWith an 82% female workforce globally, 55% of global VP and above positions held by women, and 46%\\nof our U.S. workforce representing employees who are Black, Indigenous, and People of Color (BIPOC),\\nwe are proud of the steps we have taken on this journey. We recognize, however, that we have more work\\nto do in order to accomplish greater results.\\n\\nClimate Action\\nWe continued to facilitate the transition to a low-carbon economy and are proud to have joined CDP’s\\n2020 Climate A List, with the highest score of A. For the second year in a row, we achieved Net Zero\\nScope 1 and Scope 2 emissions and sourced 100% renewable electricity globally for our direct operations.\\nAfter establishing our science based targets (SBTs) for reducing Scope 1, 2, and 3 greenhouse gas (GHG)\\nemissions last year, we are working to meet these important goals by the end of fiscal 2030. In fiscal 2021,\\nwe made strong progress on our Scope 1 and 2 SBTs and continued to expand our efforts towards meeting\\nour Scope 3 SBT.\\nOur largest renewable energy agreement to date—a 22 MW Virtual Power Purchase Agreement for a wind\\nfarm in Oklahoma—became fully operational, generating enough clean, renewable energy to cover our\\nentire North America operations. We also expanded our growing renewable energy portfolio with a new\\non-site solar installation in Hillmount, Canada, bringing our total solar capacity to 5.7 MW. We generated a\\ncumulative total of more than 5,000 MWh of solar energy in fiscal 2021, supporting both progress toward\\nour SBTs and helping meet our facilities’ energy needs with green power.\\n\\nPackaging\\nWe aspire to lead the prestige beauty industry in developing more responsible packaging solutions for our\\nconsumers and to help drive innovation toward the goal of a circular plastic economy. We have made great\\nstrides to increase the amount of post-consumer recycled (PCR) material in our packaging. In fiscal 2021,\\nwe achieved our 2025 PCR goal years ahead of schedule, reaching 15% PCR material in our packaging.\\nWe have now established a new, more ambitious target for PCR: By 2025, we will increase the amount of\\nPCR material in our packaging to 25% or more. And, recognizing the increasing need to address the use\\nof virgin plastic, we have set a goal to reduce the amount of virgin petroleum plastic in our packaging\\nto 50% or less by 2030.\\n\\n9\\n\\n\\x0c LEADERSHIP LETTERS\\n\\nProduct Responsibility\\nWe are committed to sourcing ingredients responsibly and with attention to potential impacts on people and\\nenvironment. With 100% of our palm-based ingredients Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) certified,\\nwe continued to increase our purchase of palm oil from RSPO-certified physical supply chains in 2021, including\\nthrough the purchase of RSPO Independent Smallholder credits. Through these purchases, we supported groups\\ninclusive of more than 2,200 independent smallholder palm oil farmers in Indonesia and Malaysia.\\nOur innovative green chemistry program is now integrated into our product development process, giving us\\nvisibility into the green chemistry profile of new product launches. We are moving quickly to advance this work,\\nespecially in light of growing consumer interest in product formulation and believe that we are well positioned\\nto lead in this space.\\nConsumers around the world trust our brands to deliver the best beauty performance and to do so safely, as\\nsupported by the most up-to-date research and safety review, evaluation and testing of ingredients and finished\\nproducts. We are committed to sharing information about our ingredients and why we use them, with our goal\\nto have all brands publish key ingredient glossaries by the end of calendar year 2025. Clinique, Origins, Aveda,\\nand La Mer launched ingredient glossaries on their websites last year, and, in fiscal 2021, an additional seven\\nbrands—Estée Lauder, M·A·C, Bobbi Brown, Bumble and bumble, Editions de Parfums Frédéric Malle, GlamGlow,\\nand Smashbox—published their own online glossaries.\\n\\nSocial Investments\\nIn fiscal 2021, we worked to deepen our impact by further aligning the strategy of The Estée Lauder Companies\\nCharitable Foundation (ELCCF) to our broader social impact, racial equity, and gender equality strategies. This\\nalignment will help us identify and support programs at the intersection of climate justice, human rights, and\\nwell-being—with a focus on equity. ELCCF’s enhanced focus on gender equality builds on our legacy of funding\\ngirls’ education and leadership programs, and emphasizes elevating women’s power, agency, and leadership\\nat all levels.\\nOur flagship social impact programs underpin our global social investment strategy. Founded in 1992 by the late\\nEvelyn H. Lauder with the launch of the iconic Pink Ribbon, The Estée Lauder Companies’ Breast Cancer Campaign\\n(The Campaign) is our largest corporate social impact program. Together, The Campaign and ELCCF have funded\\nmore than $108 million for lifesaving global research, education and medical services. Our groundbreaking\\nM·A·C VIVA GLAM campaign has raised more than $500 million since its inception in 1994 for the global fight\\nagainst HIV /AIDS and its mission to support health and rights for all, with a focus on women and girls and the\\nLGBTQIA+ community.\\n\\nCONFIDENCE IN THE FUTURE\\nWe are proud of the progress we have made as a company to advance our social impact and sustainability\\nstrategies, while navigating the ongoing complexities of COVID-19. As always, we thank our employees across\\nour global organization and our stockholders, consumers, suppliers, and communities for their continued\\nsupport and belief in The Estée Lauder Companies. With our values and our purpose continuing to guide\\nus, our future will be bright.\\n\\nWILLIAM P. LAUDER\\nExecutive Chairman\\nThe Estée Lauder Companies Inc.\\n\\nFABRIZIO FREDA\\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\\nThe Estée Lauder Companies Inc\\n\\n10\\n\\n\\x0c LEADERSHIP LETTERS\\n\\nLETTER FROM\\n\\nNANCY MAHON\\n\\nDear Stakeholders,\\nThis past year has made clear that COVID-19 has fundamentally changed our world, further accelerating the need\\nfor companies to make a positive impact on the environment and in our communities. At The Estée Lauder Companies,\\nwe take that responsibility seriously, and, in fiscal 2021, we worked hard to continue developing long-term solutions\\nto help protect our planet, drive inclusion and equity, and put people at the heart of everything we do—all while meeting\\nour business objectives. I am filled with immense pride for our employees and our business, both of which continue\\nto thrive despite extraordinary circumstances.\\nThe work of social impact and sustainability only succeeds when employees lead the way as ambassadors and agents of\\nchange. Not only have our employees delivered on this charge, they’ve done so with resilience, tenacity, and compassion.\\nAs evidence of this, employee giving was near an all-time high in fiscal 2021. Our employees enthusiastically participated\\nin charitable opportunities, taking advantage of Company matching programs in support of racial equity initiatives,\\nCOVID-19 and disaster relief efforts, and environmental causes.\\nAnd, they continued to deepen their knowledge of social impact and sustainability issues. Our investment in embedding\\nand upskilling is perhaps most evident in the launch of the Beauty Inspired, Values Driven Interactive Learning Guide.\\nThe guide helps ensure that no matter what part of the business someone touches, or what language they speak, employees\\nhave access to information on the Company’s social impact and sustainability programs and can find meaningful ways\\nto get involved.\\nI’ve been humbled by the incredible dedication, goodwill, and skill shown by the teams and partners that fuel our company’s\\npositive impact in the world. It will take all of us—from our unique portfolio of beloved brands to our employees to our leaders\\nat every level—to accomplish the change that we know we’re capable of. Because together, we can accomplish anything.\\nThank you for your support of The Estée Lauder Companies.\\n\\nNANCY MAHON\\nSenior Vice President, Global Corporate Citizenship and Sustainability\\nThe Estée Lauder Companies Inc.\\n\\n11\\n\\nIn fiscal 2021, we continued to support\\nour employees facing financial\\nhardships due to COVID-19 through\\nfurther contributions to the ELC Cares\\nEmployee Relief Fund, which was started\\nat the beginning of the pandemic.\\n\\n\\x0c SOCIAL IMPACT &\\nSUSTAINABILITY\\nGOALS & PROGRESS\\nOUR GOALS ARE AN IMPORTANT PART OF OUR STRATEGY TO EMBED\\nSOCIAL IMPACT AND SUSTAINABILITY INTO BUSINESS OPERATIONS.

Our social impact and sustainability goals are designed to link\\nthe Company’s commitments and business value creation.\\n\\n14\\n\\n\\x0c OUR COMMITMENT TO SOCIAL IMPACT & SUSTAINABILITY\\n\\nMANAGING FOR THE LONG TERM\\nWe manage our business for the long term. Family ownership allows The Estée Lauder Companies\\nto be guided by the principle of patient capital. Our Company’s long-term, strategic approach helps set\\nour direction by regularly looking out 10 years into the future to inform our continuous transformation—\\nin order to best position us for continued growth.

For example, by integrating sustainable practices across the product life cycle, we can\\ndrive environmental performance and add value for our brands. One example is the creation of\\nsustainability stage gates in our new product launch process in fiscal 2021. With this approach, we plan\\nto efficiently weave sustainability into the innovation process across product development, package\\ndevelopment, marketing, and brand leadership, underscoring our commitment to embed sustainability\\nacross our business.\\nWe take a similar holistic approach to embedding equity and social impact across our business. During\\nfiscal 2021, we elevated our investment in, awareness, and attention to racial and social equity and\\ngender equality by establishing the Equity and Engagement Center of Excellence. Read more on page 33.\\nWe believe that effectively managing our social impact and sustainability work will be an important\\npart of our future success.

The SVP directs a dedicated team that leads corporate-wide sustainability\\nstrategy; social impact efforts; and strategic planning and communications around social impact and\\nsustainability, including supporting brand-and region-led sustainability strategies.\\n\\nDRIVING INTEGRATION ACROSS THE BUSINESS\\nOur brands and regions play a vital role in integrating and embedding social impact and\\nsustainability across our business. Each of the brands in our well-diversified portfolio has\\nembraced our commitment to be Beauty Inspired, Values Driven by developing its own\\nunique social impact and sustainability strategy. Working hand in hand with the corporate\\nteam, our brands drive awareness with consumers and contribute to our corporate social\\nimpact and sustainability goals.\\nOur regional teams support our ongoing commitment to social impact and sustainability\\nby incorporating global best practices and translating enterprise-level targets and initiatives\\nfor local impact. Our regional organizations continue to invest in new resources to drive social\\nimpact and sustainability efforts in their markets, closely collaborating with our global team.\\nOur incredible employees are at the heart of these efforts. Their dedication and passion\\nunderscore everything we do and help us to maintain the momentum needed to deliver\\npositive impact.\\n\\n15\\n\\n\\x0c OUR COMMITMENT TO SOCIAL IMPACT & SUSTAINABILITY\\n\\nCORPORATE GOVERNANCE AND EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION\\nOur Board of Directors (the “Board”) has developed corporate governance practices to help it fulfill its responsibilities to\\nstockholders to provide general direction and oversight of the management of the Company’s business and affairs. Our Board\\nis led by our Executive Chairman, who is a member of the Lauder family. In addition, we have an independent director\\nwho serves as our Presiding Director. A majority of the directors on our Board are independent. As of the end of fiscal 2021,\\nthere were 16 directors on our Board, comprising: (i) our CEO; (ii) 11 nonemployee directors (10 of them independent); and\\n(iii) four directors who are members of the Lauder family, including our Executive Chairman.\\nThe Board has established the following standing Board committees: the Nominating and ESG Committee; the Compensation\\nCommittee, which includes the Stock Plan Subcommittee; and the Audit Committee. For more information about our Board\\nand committees, please visit the Governance section on our website.\\nOur Nominating and ESG Committee has oversight responsibility for our company’s environmental, social, and governance\\nactivities and practices, including citizenship and sustainability matters. The SVP GCCS attends meetings of the Nominating\\nand ESG Committee and provides updates on topics such as climate, progress toward goals, and other related matters, as\\nappropriate. In addition, the SVP GCCS periodically presents at Board meetings.\\nOur Compensation Committee establishes and approves compensation plans and arrangements with respect to the Company’s\\nexecutive officers and administers the Company’s executive annual incentive plan. The Stock Plan Subcommittee has authority\\nover decisions regarding awards to executive officers under the Company’s share incentive plan. Our compensation program\\nis designed to attract and retain world-class talent and to motivate achievement of both our long-term and short-term goals.\\nWe believe that the design and governance of our compensation program supports the business strategy and the overall goal\\nto continue sustainable growth of net sales, profitability, and return on invested capital on a long-term basis.\\nGiven our history, ownership structure, and strategy, we follow principles of long-term stewardship and patient capital, and\\nour compensation approach reflects and supports this approach. Consistent with our culture and our compensation philosophy\\nand objectives, our combination of compensation elements is intended to help drive and promote strong, balanced, and\\nsustainable corporate performance.\\nWe evaluate the performance of our employees, including our executives, under social impact and sustainability goals holistically,\\nwithin the framework of our corporate strategy, as an input into compensation decisions. In particular, we incorporate specific\\ngoals tied to the Company’s broader social impact and sustainability strategy into the business goals for top executives, and\\ncompensation decisions are made based on their achievement. For example, such business goals were included in the fiscal\\n2021 Executive Annual Incentive Plan program and were used as an input into determining fiscal 2021 equity grants. The fiscal 2021\\nbusiness goals for top executives encompassed multiple strategic focus areas concerning social impact and sustainability\\nmatters. Specifically, the fiscal 2021 business goals for certain executives incorporate ID&E matters; global talent development\\nand retention; and progress in connection with Company sustainability objectives.\\nAdditional information on our governance practices and information about executive compensation matters can be found in\\nour 2021 Proxy Statement.\\n\\nOur offices in Tokyo, Japan\\n\\n16\\n\\n\\x0c OUR COMMITMENT TO SOCIAL IMPACT & SUSTAINABILITY\\n\\nETHICS\\nWe promote a culture of uncompromising ethics and integrity. Our standards help us uphold\\nthe principles and ideals that make us a global leader in prestige beauty. We expect our\\nemployees and business partners to conduct business in compliance with applicable laws and\\nregulations and with the high ethical standards and policies set forth in our Code of Conduct\\n(“Code”) and Supplier Code of Conduct.\\nOur Code helps to protect our reputation as an ethical corporate citizen. Newly hired employees\\nare required to sign an acknowledgement that they have received, read, and will comply with\\nthe Code. In addition, annually, employees above certain levels are required to complete Ethics\\nand Anti-Bribery and Corruption trainings and acknowledge the Code. From time to time, we\\nconduct trainings on the Code for groups of our employees.\\nEmployees are expected to raise questions or concerns about conduct that may be inconsistent\\nwith the law, the Code, or other policies to their supervisor, Human Resources contact, the\\nGlobal Ethics team, and through The Estée Lauder Companies’ Integrity Helpline. Employees are\\nable to communicate and report suspected violations confidentially and anonymously, where\\npermitted by law. Employees can raise questions or concerns by calling the toll-free number,\\nvisiting the Integrity Helpline website, or sending a text message (text communication available\\nin North America only). Additionally, questions or concerns related to questionable accounting,\\ninternal controls, or auditing matters can also be raised directly to the Audit Committee of the\\nBoard of Directors. We have standard operating procedures to manage reports to ensure\\nconsistent investigation and response procedures across incident types and reporting channels.\\nSerious violations are reviewed by the Company’s Ethics and Compliance Committee, which\\noversees implementation of the Code.\\nThe Ethics and Compliance Committee reports to the Audit Committee on a regular basis\\nregarding the effectiveness of our Global Ethics Program. The Company’s Internal Audit\\nfunction periodically reviews business unit operations using a risk-based audit plan. Internal\\nAudit regularly assesses the effectiveness of the Company’s Ethics and Anti-Bribery and Corruption\\nprograms through routine and targeted audits of business functions and/or sales affiliates.\\n\\nOUR VIEW ON HUMAN RIGHTS\\nThe United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and\\nHuman Rights provide a framework to help us identify\\nand prioritize our human rights risks and impacts. Proactive\\nhuman rights due diligence is an ongoing process, and we\\nhave policies, processes, training, and systems in place to\\nidentify, assess, monitor, and mitigate or eliminate actual\\nor potential human rights impacts.\\nOur Code of Conduct outlines our expectations for\\npromoting a respectful workplace, engaging in ethical\\nbusiness practice, and operating in a socially responsible\\nand fair manner. We require our employees, business\\npartners, service providers, and suppliers to operate in\\ncompliance with all applicable laws, including, but not\\nlimited to, employment laws pertaining to child labor,\\nminimum wage, overtime compensation, hiring, and\\noccupational safety.\\nOur Supplier Code of Conduct sets forth the basic\\nrequirements we expect of suppliers, including vendors,\\nservice providers, independent contractors, and consultants,\\nas a condition of doing business with our company. It is\\nbased on internationally recognized standards, including the\\nUniversal Declaration of Human Rights and International\\nLabour Organization’s Conventions.

In fiscal 2021,\\nwe completed a comprehensive, data-driven analysis to define, validate, and prioritize our social impact and sustainability focus\\nareas. Specifically, we conducted a “Big Data” assessment of the global regulatory, corporate disclosure, and media environments\\nas related to topics under consideration. We also evaluated stakeholder interest through desk research and direct engagement,\\nincluding extensive internal alignment and outreach to external stakeholders. As part of the assessment, we considered each matter’s\\nrelevance to our business strategy and objectives; importance to key stakeholders; and potential impact on the environment,\\nsociety, and economy.\\nThe priority focus areas analysis is a point-in-time evaluation. Even as many of our previously highly ranked issues remained constant,\\nwe saw a significant elevation for the issues of inclusion, diversity, and equity and employee health and safety. These changes\\nreflected the racial and social justice movements in 2020 and the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. Climate change also increased\\nin importance, especially for external stakeholders. Transparency and consumer citizenship and sustainability needs emerged as\\nadditional priorities, reflecting demand for greater disclosure and access to environmental and social information.\\nOur priority focus areas are reflected in our corporate goals and commitments and are integrated into our strategic planning and risk\\nmanagement processes. We map our priority focus areas to related Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Standards. Throughout this\\nreport, we provide a closer look at our approach and performance related to these topics.\\n\\nFY21 PRIORITY FOCUS AREAS\\n\\nGRI STANDARDS\\n\\nCLIMATE CHANGE AND GHGS\\n\\nGRI 305: Emissions\\nGRI 201: Climate Risk\\n\\nPRODUCT QUALITY AND SAFETY (including ingredient transparency)\\n\\nGRI 416: Customer Health and Safety\\nGRI 417: Marketing and Labeling\\n\\nPRODUCT AND PACKAGING DESIGN (including green chemistry)\\n\\nGRI 301: Materials\\n\\nINCLUSION, DIVERSITY & EQUITY\\n\\nGRI 401: Employment\\nGRI 405: Diversity and Equal Opportunity\\n\\nEMPLOYEE HEALTH AND SAFETY\\n\\nGRI 403: Occupational Health and Safety\\n\\nRESPONSIBLE SOURCING\\n\\nGRI 308: Supplier Environmental Assessment\\nGRI 414: Supplier Social Assessment\\n\\nTRANSPARENCY\\n\\nGRI 102: General Disclosures\\n\\nCONSUMER SOCIAL IMPACT AND SUSTAINABILITY NEEDS\\n\\nGRI 416: Customer Health and Safety\\nGRI 417: Marketing and Labeling\\n\\nCOMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT (including social investments)\\n\\nGRI 201: Community Investments\\n\\nSTAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT\\nWe seek to build productive relationships with our key stakeholders, including employees, consumers, investors, retailers,\\nnongovernmental organizations (NGOs), suppliers, regulators, policymakers, and local communities. These relationships\\ndepend on active engagement and meaningful dialogue to strengthen bonds and expand trust. As we shape the future of\\nbeauty, we incorporate stakeholder perspectives we believe will help drive our future success.\\nThe types of stakeholder engagements and topics discussed concerning social impact and sustainability matters vary widely.\\nFor example, we engage with our employees in various ways including: direct interaction with managers or through Human\\nResources business partners; our company’s intranet; social media; town halls, special presentations, and learning events;\\nand employee engagement and pulse surveys. Topics covered during employee engagement include ID&E, benefits, learning\\nand development, and work-life structure, among others.\\n18\\n\\n\\x0c OUR COMMITMENT TO SOCIAL IMPACT & SUSTAINABILITY\\n\\nOur consumer engagements include: direct interaction online and in store settings; consumer feedback portals, including\\nConsumer Care; satisfaction surveys; and social media and influencer channels. Consumer interest in social impact and\\nsustainability includes product information; ingredient transparency; sourcing practices; and animal testing.\\nWe engage with our investors in a number of ways. We have a comprehensive, strategic investor relations program to help\\ncommunicate with the investment community about our company’s performance and corporate values, as well as to educate\\ncurrent and prospective investors and the sell-side analyst community about our business strategies and social impact and\\nsustainability commitments and initiatives. In fiscal 2021, we enhanced our investor outreach by expanding dialogue around\\nour progress in social impact and sustainability. We also conduct an annual ESG investor perception study to listen and learn\\nas we continue delivering value to our investors.\\n\\nOUR COMMITMENT TO THE UNITED NATIONS SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOALS\\nThe United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are a voluntary framework of 17 global goals and targets meant\\nto accelerate advancement toward a more sustainable world. Since they were issued in 2015, they have become a common\\ntouchstone for governments, the private sector, and civil society in tracking sustainability progress.\\nWE PRIMARILY FOCUS ON THE FIVE SDGs WHERE WE BELIEVE WE CAN HAVE THE MOST IMPACT TO HELP DELIVER ON\\nTHE VISION OF A MORE SUSTAINABLE WORLD:\\nSDG3.

We are committed to\\nstrengthening our safety culture through\\ncontinuous improvement and innovation\\nand seek to be an industry leader with\\nregard to workplace safety.\\n\\nOUR MANAGEMENT APPROACH\\nWe adhere to rigorous safety policies and practices and reinforce our safety messages through\\nconsistent communication and engagement with employees. We promote a proactive and collaborative\\napproach to safety and compliance to help us reach our ultimate goal of zero workplace incidents.\\nSafety is overseen by the Executive Vice President, Global Supply Chain, and managed by the Senior\\nVice President, Environment, Health, Safety + Sustainability (EHS+S). There is a global EHS+S team\\ncovering supply chain, research and development (R&D), retail, and offices, with facility-level EHS+S\\nmanagers reporting into the global team.\\nOur Environmental Health and Safety Policy establishes the standard we require of our workplaces for\\nall employees, contractors, and visitors. Our global EHS+S management team monitors and implements\\nthis policy throughout our manufacturing, distribution, and R&D sites. The policy is reviewed on an\\nannual basis, and sites must adopt and sign off on the policy each year.\\nWe have a global procedure for hazard and risk assessment that we require all our sites to adhere to\\nand implement. We include safety in our internal audits, which occur at each facility approximately\\nonce every two years. New facilities that are the result of acquisitions are assessed for risk, and plans\\nare made to integrate those operations within our existing safety policies and protocols.\\nAs part of our Environmental and Safety Management System, we have a process in place to investigate\\nand report workplace incidents, including injuries, property damage, spills, and near misses. The\\nEnvironmental and Safety Management System also defines criteria for serious accidents and incidents\\nthat could result in a high-consequence injury. We comply with legal requirements with regard to\\nwhistleblower protections around employees’ rights to remove themselves from, and report on, what\\nthey believe are unsafe conditions.\\nSafety incident reports are entered into a central reporting system where a detailed root cause analysis\\nis documented, and corrective actions are identified and tracked to completion. We also have a\\nprocess where safety alerts and best practices are issued globally for sites to take preventative actions.\\nOur safety program is fully integrated into our environmental management system, which in turn\\nhas been certified to ISO 14001 standards at our manufacturing sites.* As part of maintaining our\\ncertification, we continuously improve our environmental and safety management and performance.\\n\\n21\\n\\n*Excludes sites that were acquired after January 1, 2020.\\n\\n\\x0c SOCIAL IMPACT EMPLOYEE EXPERIENCE\\n\\nMANAGING THE CONTINUED\\nIMPACTS OF COVID-19\\n\\nIn fiscal 2021, we implemented additional layers of protection to\\nfurther support our employees, such as the roll-out of personal\\nprotective equipment (PPE) minimum standards including face\\nshields and glasses; COVID-19 testing capabilities at more than\\n20 sites across North America and EMEA; installing barriers and\\napplying other physical distancing measures; implementing a daily\\nwork readiness questionnaire; and incorporating improvements\\nto our HVAC systems at our manufacturing and distribution plants.\\nAcross the globe, our employees used more than 5 million\\nmasks to protect themselves and others while working on-site.\\nWe worked diligently to reopen our stores in ways reflective of\\nour values of safety and service to both our employees and our\\nconsumers. We also continued to leverage technology to reinvent\\nour workplace to accommodate thousands of employees working\\nremotely and instituted guidelines for phased office reopening\\nacross our global regions.\\nOur actions were informed by the continued guidance of our\\nMedical Advisory Board. Convened in April 2020 at the start of\\nthe pandemic, the board is comprised of leading physicians and\\nhealth professionals with expertise across a variety of disciplines.\\nThe Medical Advisory Board works closely with our internal\\nHealth and Safety Team and Company leaders to guide our\\nhealth- and safety-related efforts.\\n\\nPROGRESS TOWARD\\nOUR GOALS\\nGOAL:\\nWe will drive safety to continue decreasing the total incident\\nrate* to ensure continued world class–leading levels, with a goal\\nof 0.15 by the end of calendar year 2025.\\nWe achieved a total incident rate of 0.18 in fiscal 2021,\\na decrease from 0.23 in fiscal 2020.\\n*Total incident rate is the number of OSHA recordable incidents per 100\\nworkers.

These measures will remain part\\nof our standard operating procedures for as long as the level of\\nrisk calls for them.\\n\\nDR. JESSICA HERZSTEIN\\nMedical Advisory Board\\n\\nENGAGING EMPLOYEES IN\\nPRIORITIZING SAFETY\\nOur employees are our best safety ambassadors. We encourage\\nthem to take proactive measures to ensure safety protocols are\\nfollowed across our sites, including manufacturing, distribution,\\nR&D, retail, and office locations. Our global EHS+S teams run\\ncampaigns throughout the year to keep specific safety initiatives\\nfront of mind.\\nOur Behavior Based Safety (BBS) program reinforces our\\nactively caring safety culture through employee-led initiatives and\\ncommunications around best practices. In fiscal 2021, we had\\n42 BBS Steering Teams across 24 facilities in 11 countries. These\\nteams supported more than 4,800 employees, completed more\\nthan 3,600 BBS observations, and developed and implemented\\nmore than 520 projects to improve safety and increase awareness\\nfor safe behaviors at their sites.\\nIn fiscal 2021, we used a third-party to assess the efficacy of the\\nBBS program. More than 3,300 employees (83% participation)\\ncompleted an 18-item survey, and 124 separate interviews were\\nconducted virtually in 26 locations. Overall, the assessment\\nshowed that the BBS process is functioning well, and it is an\\nintegral component of the Company’s overall safety culture.\\nRecommendations included strengthening the program by\\nincreasing employee and management engagement with BBS\\nactivities. Specific actions have already been introduced in\\nthe FY22 BBS Strategy to address communication, training, and\\nrecognition opportunities.\\n\\n\\x0c SOCIAL IMPACT EMPLOYEE EXPERIENCE\\n\\nHEALTH AND SAFETY TRAINING\\nWe seek to keep our workforce up-to-date on safety\\npolicies, procedures, and expectations.

Additionally, five Environmental and Safety System\\nAssessment audits were completed for the Blaine Manufacturing; Melville (New York) Manufacturing; Oevel Manufacturing;\\nWhitman Laboratories; and Lachen (Switzerland) Manufacturing facilities.\\nWe installed new fleet management systems on numerous powered industrial trucks (e.g., forklifts) across our manufacturing and\\ndistribution sites in fiscal 2021. These systems improve safety for both drivers and pedestrians while also increasing productivity using\\nstate-of-the-art technology. Additionally, gates and guardrails were installed in many sites to further protect pedestrians in work\\nareas where powered industrial trucks are present.\\nRETAIL\\n“Safety Crowns” is an awards program that recognizes our freestanding North American stores that meet and exceed certain\\nsafety metrics over a designated time period. Metrics include completing monthly safety checklists, sharing monthly safety topics\\nwith on-site employees, and providing feedback on safety to the corporate safety team.\\nIn addition, our employees continue to proactively lead on safety issues in their workplaces. In some of our retail stores,\\nfield leaders have organized a safety committee to provide guidance to staff on safety policies and procedures, regulated waste,\\nand training compliance.\\nLABORATORIES\\nIn fiscal 2021, 75 employees completed the Safety Training Series for Lab Safety Reps program and earned an ELC-Certified Lab\\nSafety Representative certificate. A total of 11 Lab Safety courses are available to lab employees through our internal learning platform.\\n\\nSAFETY CAMPAIGNS PROMOTE ACTIVE CARING\\nOur global EHS+S teams run campaigns throughout the year to\\nhighlight specific safety initiatives for employees. Examples include:\\n• Monthly tip sheets were created and delivered to Global Retail\\nemployees highlighting safety topics such as fire preparedness,\\nladder and step stool safety, and avoidance of “struck by” injuries.\\n• During ergonomic awareness month in October, safety tips were\\nshared throughout our various working environments.\\n• For Safety Month in June, safety resources were promoted through\\nvarious channels.

We use surveys as\\none mechanism to measure engagement levels across the organization and gather valuable feedback. Key topics covered during\\nemployee engagement include inclusion, diversity, and equity (ID&E); learning and development; work-life structure; and\\nemployee benefits. Based on our review of employee survey results, as well as inputs gathered via other employee interactions,\\nwe implement action plans to enhance employee satisfaction and facilitate alignment with our overall human capital strategy.\\nWe deployed an Enterprise Pulse Survey in January 2021. The survey was designed to help us better understand how the events\\nof 2020 impacted employee engagement and well-being and to inform how we can best support our employees in the future.\\nDespite the challenges of fiscal 2021, overall engagement increased compared to employee surveys conducted in previous years.\\nResults showed positive\\nchange throughout our\\norganization regarding:\\n\\n• providing employees with resources to support their needs\\n• making employees feel recognized\\n• communicating with employees and keeping them informed\\n• dedication to social impact and sustainability\\n\\nWe will continue to prioritize greater enhancement of work-life balance; better linking of organizational priorities and goals to\\nindividual performance; and ongoing focus on employee growth and development based on employee responses to the survey.\\n\\nCONTINUING TO EVOLVE IN RESPONSE TO COVID-19\\nOur employee engagement efforts have taken on increased importance during the\\nglobal pandemic. Throughout the year, we distributed numerous internal communications\\nand hosted 18 virtual Town Halls with our Medical Advisory Board across brands, regions,\\nand functions to answer questions, provide support, and share resources. In fiscal 2021, we\\nalso launched a new initiative to evolve the way we work and enhance work-life balance\\nand productivity. As part of this effort, we introduced a set of How We Work Together\\nprinciples and Meeting Effectiveness Guidelines to lay the foundation for our “future of\\nwork” approach.\\nWe dedicated our annual Mental Health Awareness Month (May 2021) to raising the\\nprofile of several initiatives targeted to help our employees balance work-life and overall\\nwell-being. Included were: Global Reset Day, a global day off in support of employees;\\nstaging special events and programs across our regions in support of emotional wellness\\nand community; and raising awareness of assistance programs that are available to our\\nemployees to improve mental health, including access to counseling and crisis services.\\nWe continue to be guided by our values of treating our employees with the utmost\\nrespect and fairness and honoring our civic responsibilities to the global communities\\nwe serve, while remaining focused on maintaining our company’s long-term growth.\\nDespite the prudent financial measures we took in response to COVID-19 in fiscal 2021,\\nmitigating the long-term impact of the pandemic required us to make some difficult\\ndecisions, including furloughing and laying off some members of our workforce. We\\nhave endeavored to manage through this time with sensitivity and care.\\n\\nCONNECTING THROUGH THE MYELC PLATFORM\\nIn fiscal 2021, we modernized MyELC, our internal employee website, to transform and enhance the digital\\nworkplace experience for employees worldwide. The new site encourages employee engagement while\\nserving as a one-stop-shop for important Company news and information and fostering greater collaboration\\nand productivity. Employees can use social-media-like features to “like” and comment on postings, personalize\\ntheir news, and collaborate in communities related to their role, function or region. They can also access\\ncontent related to priority focus areas including Inclusion, Diversity & Equity; resources such as our\\nBeauty Inspired, Values Driven Interactive Learning Guide; and key applications to do their jobs effectively.\\n\\n25\\n\\n\\x0c SOCIAL IMPACT EMPLOYEE EXPERIENCE\\n\\nEMPLOYEE BENEFITS\\nWe offer compelling and competitive compensation packages to attract, motivate, and retain world-class talent, and we are\\ncommitted to fair and equitable pay across the organization.

ERGs not only offer support,\\nnetworking, and community-building, but also expand the possibilities for our employees to engage and collaborate on creative\\napproaches to business opportunities. Our ERGs and their global chapters are inclusive and open for all employees to join, inspired\\nby the belief that “you don’t have to be to belong.”\\nDespite the global pandemic, in fiscal 2021, we continued to see increased participation in ERGs, with 43 active ERGs worldwide in\\n12 countries and with membership of more than 5,000 employees globally. ERGs pivoted to fully virtual programming that engaged\\naudiences on a global level.\\nAs an organization, we leveraged the power and impact of ERGs while continuing to expand the global network.

When she placed\\nher name on a jar of her signature cream 75 years ago, she reimagined what was possible for\\nwomen to achieve and made history—creating a company based on the principles of equality and\\nwomen’s advancement. Advancing women both within our organization and around the world\\ncontinues to be one of our core areas of focus.\\nToday, we see incredible women across our organization at every level, leading from every chair.\\nWe are part of the United Nations Foundation’s Five for 5 Initiative and have developed a set\\nof commitments aligned with UN Sustainable Development Goal 5, centered around achieving\\ngender equality and empowering all women and girls.

As a company comprised of 82%\\nwomen, we have pledged to achieve gender pay equity globally by 2023; increase representation of women from underrepresented\\ngroups across our regions and affiliates; and increase representation for Black women at all levels in the United States by 2025.\\nWe have continued our progress toward our pay equity goals. Building on our prior global workforce study, we re-engaged the labor\\neconomics consulting firm that supported that study to refresh our pay equity analysis focusing on our non-Point-of-Sale population\\nglobally based on gender, and for our U.S. workforce, based on race. As part of this study, we conducted an in-depth statistical analysis\\nof employee compensation, based on like-for-like jobs, considering factors such as grade, experience, time in role, location, and\\nperformance, among others.\\nTo support our commitment to gender and racial equity at work, we have made rigorous and objective pay equity assessments a core\\ncomponent of our regular compensation review. The results show that we are making progress. The modest, statistically significant\\npay gap previously reported for women has been narrowed. Globally, it is expected that women will earn 98.7% in fiscal 2022 of what\\ncomparably positioned men earn (as compared to 98.2% in fiscal 2021). We are strongly committed to closing the remaining gap for\\nwomen. In the United States, we continue to have statistical parity of pay between White and both Black and LatinX employees,\\nas well as for non-White employees collectively.\\nWe believe that gender and racial pay parity are important steps towards achieving full equity in all aspects of employment at The\\nEstée Lauder Companies. We have made pay adjustments in fiscal 2022 and are refining our strategy to close any existing pay gaps in a\\nway that addresses identified sources of pay differences and protects against their re-emergence over time. We are analyzing the root\\ncauses of pay differentials and are formulating recommendations with respect to further enhancing our career and talent development\\nprograms to ensure equity in career opportunities.\\nAchieving equity requires a holistic approach; one that further invests in our diverse talent through career advancement, development\\nprograms, hiring practices, enhanced talent management, and flexible work principles to ensure sustainable progress over the long term.\\nRead more about these programs in the Employee Engagement and Learning and Development sections on pages 24 and 28.\\n\\n39\\n\\n\\x0c SOCIAL IMPACT INCLUSION, DIVERSITY & EQUITY\\n\\nEQUALITY OF LEADERSHIP\\nWe believe that all genders should have equal access to positions of leadership within our organization.

As part of our equality strategy, we are aiming to\\nachieve gender parity within our Board of Directors by 2025; reaching gender parity for women in senior leadership positions\\nworldwide by 2025; and expanding leadership development programs to give employees the tools and support they need for success.\\nTo this end, in fiscal 2021 we launched the Open Doors Women’s Leadership program, an intensive training program for females at\\nthe director level. The program combines self-assessment, instruction, experiential learning, team building, and coaching, as each\\nparticipant develops her own individual, authentic leadership style. The initial training program is followed by a year-long enrichment\\nprogram of additional training, coaching, and support. Each participant is partnered with a sponsor to enhance her development\\nand career journey.\\nFollowing on the positive feedback from the Leadership program, we launched The Open Doors Collection in July 2021, a self-guided\\nvirtual leadership development program available to all employees globally to help them develop critical skills to lead as an\\nindividual, across a team, and throughout the enterprise.\\n\\nEQUALITY OF ACCESS TO HEALTH\\nAND EDUCATION\\nWe believe that all people around the world deserve access to health,\\neducation, and economic participation. We are also committed to giving\\nwomen and girls access to the proper tools and skills needed to become\\nsuccessful and to create lasting change.\\nWe have pledged to maintain our position as the number one leader\\nin supporting research through the Breast Cancer Research Foundation®.\\nWe are also working with multi-stakeholder partners to drive crosssector progress and engagement and supporting organizations doing\\ncritical work to promote gender equality. Learn more about how we are\\ncollaborating with others to address health and education disparities in\\nour Social Investments section on page 42.\\nFinally, we will leverage our platform and use our voice to connect with\\nand empower the next generation of women leaders.

Furthermore, the creation of our SBTs\\nwas management led and the targets approved by our Executive\\nChairman and our CEO.\\nWe evolved our climate governance structure following the\\nannouncement of our SBTs, with the previously established Net\\nZero Steering Committee becoming the Climate Action Steering\\nCommittee. The committee, which comprises senior leaders from\\nvarious functions who are members of our Executive Leadership\\nTeam (ELT) or report to members of our ELT, is responsible for\\nassessing and managing climate-related risks and opportunities.\\nIn addition, the committee evaluates where we can best apply\\nour capital to advance the Company’s climate goals.\\nIn fiscal 2021, we created the Climate Action Management\\nCommittee, responsible for implementing and operationalizing\\ninitiatives needed to achieve our SBTs. This committee includes\\nvarious management-level employees who oversee special\\nprojects and partnerships, the development of internal policies\\nand communications strategies, and engagement with our brands\\nand regions. The committee reports to the Climate Action Steering\\nCommittee on a periodic basis.\\n\\n\\x0c SUSTAINABILITY CLIMATE AND ENVIRONMENT\\n\\nSTRATEGY\\nOur climate action strategy guides our decision-making process and enables us to respond thoughtfully to challenges and\\nopportunities. The strategy focuses on three areas:\\nSUSTAINABLE OPERATIONS: We address impacts related to our own, direct operations (Scope 1 and 2 emissions) and the indirect\\nemissions (Scope 3) from transportation and distribution of our products. Initiatives related to these areas are meant to drive emissions\\nreductions and cost savings for the Company. To address Scope 1 and 2 emissions, we pursue energy efficiency and on-site/off-site\\nrenewable energy. For transportation and distribution-related emissions (Scope 3), we are focusing on improving data quality to\\nenable better decision making and maximize efficiency. Please see page 64 for more information.\\nSUPPLIER ENGAGEMENT: To address carbon impacts beyond our own direct operations (Scope 3), we are working to implement\\nintegrated solutions and foster joint value creation with supply chain partners and Third-Party Manufacturers. Please see page 64 for\\nmore information.\\nPRODUCT INNOVATION: We seek to embed sustainability across our product development process to reduce life-cycle carbon\\nimpacts. Please see our Product Formulation chapter on page 78 for more information.\\nWe have established an annual dedicated capital fund to support low-carbon sustainability initiatives and technologies that have the\\npotential to positively impact the planet while meeting our business objectives. In fiscal 2021, we evolved the fund to help finance\\ninitiatives in support of meeting our science-based targets. These initiatives included a rooftop solar photovoltaic array at our recently\\nconstructed manufacturing facility in Canada, and a conversion from oil heating to utility-supplied steam heating generated from\\nbiomass at our manufacturing and distribution facility in Switzerland.\\n\\nRISK MANAGEMENT\\nWe embed risk management into existing practices and business operations through our Enterprise Risk Management process.\\nCorporate risks, including climate-related risks, are identified and addressed through a consistent and disciplined approach that\\nis appropriately integrated with our strategic planning process.\\nWe conducted a climate risk assessment in fiscal 2019. The assessment included a climate scenario analysis of our facilities’ exposure\\nto physical risks, such as changing precipitation patterns and transition risks such as availability of key commodities; and shifting\\nstakeholder preferences. We modeled the risks according to two climate scenarios: one in which global emissions trends continue as\\nusual and another in which emissions are aggressively mitigated and global warming stays between 0.3–1.7°C.\\nThrough this analysis, we found that some of our sites are exposed to heatwaves, extreme precipitation, water stress, coastal flooding,\\nand increased temperature. The impact for each of these risks was assessed as low based on third-party analysis, given the monitoring\\nand mitigation efforts that are in place. We have used the results of our climate change scenario analysis to better understand the risks\\nposed to our business activities.\\nIn addition, please refer to page 66 for more information about our updated water risk assessment.\\n\\nMETRICS\\nIn 2020, we established SBTs to reduce our GHGs and received validation of these targets by the Science Based Targets Initiative\\n(SBTi). Our Scope 1 and 2 targets are aligned with a 1.5°C pathway, the most ambitious goal of the Paris Agreement. The SBTi does\\nnot currently classify Scope 3 target ambition; however, our Scope 3 target meets the SBTi’s criteria for ambitious value chain goals\\nand is in line with current best practice.\\nFor more information about our assessment of climate risk and response to climate change, please read our response to the\\nCDP Climate questionnaire.\\nPlease see pages 103-104 for our GHG and energy metrics.\\n\\nWe are members of the U.S. Department of Energy’s Better Plants program,\\na voluntary partnership meant to improve energy efficiency across industrial\\ncompanies. The Better Plants program provides technical assistance, in-plant\\nand online training, and energy-saving resources such as energy audits and\\ndiagnostic equipment lending programs.\\n\\n59\\n\\n\\x0c SUSTAINABILITY CLIMATE AND ENVIRONMENT\\n\\nDIRECT OPERATIONS\\n(SCOPE 1 AND 2 EMISSIONS)\\nWe have adopted a portfolio approach to reducing GHGs, which\\nincludes the use of on-site renewables, energy efficiency projects,\\ngreen utility contracts, and renewable energy credits. Our priority is\\nto reduce our operational carbon footprint by deploying high-quality\\nsolutions and investing in projects to bring additional renewable\\nenergy to the grid.\\nOUR FOCUS ON ENERGY EFFICIENCY\\n\\nINVESTING IN WIND ENERGY\\nWe are party to a Virtual Power Purchase Agreement (VPPA)\\nfor 22 megawatts (MW) of wind power from the Ponderosa wind\\nfarm in Oklahoma, United States. This arrangement represents\\nour largest renewable energy agreement to date. The Ponderosa\\nwind farm generated more than 57,700 megawatt hours (MWh)\\nof power in fiscal 2021.\\n\\nENGAGING EMPLOYEES IN SOLAR PROJECTS\\nWe are engaging employees in our journey to contribute to a stable\\nclimate and a healthy planet. On Earth Day, we launched an interactive\\nfeature on our intranet that allows employees to view real-time solar\\nenergy-generation data from the Company’s on-site solar arrays.\\nBy accessing the link to each system’s solar dashboard, employees can\\nview information such as the energy-generating capacity in MW of\\nelectricity and the real-time energy production in kilowatt hour (kWh)\\nfor each array. The data are displayed in daily, monthly, and yearly\\nincrements, as well as for the lifetime of the systems to date.\\n\\n60\\n\\n*Excludes sites that were acquired after January 1, 2020.\\n\\nWhen large companies“like The Estée Lauder\\nCompanies set their sights on an ambitious target,\\nthey can achieve huge change at a rapid pace.\\nThis is exactly the sort of leadership we need\\nto see in the climate decade, as we work to halve\\nglobal emissions.\\n\\n“\\n\\nWe track environmental performance at our facilities* and have\\nprocesses in place to collect energy metrics. We use this data to\\nmeasure the effectiveness of energy-saving activities, which\\ninclude energy-reduction projects such as lighting retrofits, air\\nflow and temperature-management systems, occupancy sensors,\\nand equipment upgrades to decrease overall energy use and\\ncarbon emissions.\\n\\nHELEN CLARKSON\\nChief Executive Officer, the Climate Group\\n\\n\\x0c SUSTAINABILITY CLIMATE AND ENVIRONMENT\\n\\nRENEWABLE ENERGY PORTFOLIO\\nOur renewable energy portfolio reflects a variety of renewable technologies and approaches, including ground-mounted and rooftop\\nsolar and our Virtual Power Purchase Agreement (VPPA) for wind energy. We also purchase renewable energy credits (RECs) to offset\\nemissions from electricity use.\\n\\nOn-Site Solar Power\\nInstalling solar technology at our new and existing sites is a key component of our strategy. For our owned and operated sites, we focus\\nour solar installations on facilities that have the most potential for productive output, such as those with large rooftops or situated near\\nvacant land. As of fiscal 2021, our total solar capacity is 5.7 MW. During the fiscal year, we generated more than 5,000 MWh of solar\\nenergy, which is equivalent to the amount of carbon sequestered by 4,300 acres of U.S. forests in one year.\\nGALGENEN, SWITZERLAND\\n• Rooftop on the main distribution center structure\\n• Generated +1,309 MWh of solar power in fiscal 2021\\n\\nMELVILLE, NEW YORK, UNITED STATES\\n• Six-acre ground-mounted solar array at manufacturing plant\\n• Generated 1,700 MWh of solar power in fiscal 2021\\n\\nPETERSFIELD, UNITED KINGDOM\\n• On-site solar system at our Petersfield-based manufacturing plant\\n• Generated 803 MWh of solar in fiscal 2021\\n• Produced more than 2,900 MWh of clean electricity since it was\\nactivated in October 2017\\n\\nBLAINE, MINNESOTA, UNITED STATES\\n• Aveda manufacturing facility’s 3.6-acre solar photovoltaic array\\n• Generated 1,307 MWh in fiscal 2021\\n\\nHILLMOUNT, CANADA\\n• Rooftop solar array on the warehouse roof structure of the manufacturing facility\\n• Anticipated annual production of 730 MWh\\n• Construction completed June 2021; system went live in July 2021\\n\\n61\\n\\n\\x0c SUSTAINABILITY CLIMATE AND ENVIRONMENT\\n\\nREDUCING THE USE OF PLASTIC\\nWe have developed internal plastics\\nguidelines in order to reduce the use\\nof virgin and nonrecyclable plastic across\\nour business, including within office\\nenvironments. Learn more about our\\nplastic-reduction efforts on page 91.\\n\\nOur offices in Long Island City, Queens, New York achieved LEED Certification in fiscal 2021\\n\\nGREEN BUILDINGS AND RETAIL DESIGN\\nWe have developed green building standards for our spaces, which include retail,\\noffice, manufacturing, distribution and warehouse, and research and development\\n(R&D) sites. Our Green Building Standards are our roadmap to help ensure that\\nnew construction and major renovations incorporate green building principles into\\ntheir design. The Standards set the baseline for practices covering energy, water,\\nwaste, and indoor air quality. We have also developed sustainability practices for\\nexisting spaces that are focused on driving sustainable behaviors.\\n\\n62\\n\\nACHIEVING LEED CERTIFICATION\\nIn fiscal 2021, we achieved LEED\\nCertification at two of our New York City\\noffices. They include a recently renovated\\nfloor at our corporate headquarters in\\nManhattan and a floor at our offices in\\nLong Island City, Queens.\\n\\n\\x0c SUSTAINABILITY CLIMATE AND ENVIRONMENT\\n\\nGreen Building Certification\\nAs part of our Green Building Standards, we have established a process to\\nidentify which of our sites should pursue green building certification. These\\ncertifications include LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design),\\nthe most widely used building certification program for environmental\\nmanagement, and WELL (a certification standard for ensuring the health and\\nwell-being of a building’s occupants).\\nOur management-led Green Building Committee reviews progress toward\\nthe objectives laid out in our standards. The committee meets quarterly to\\nmake LEED and WELL certification decisions for new spaces. Criteria include\\nsquare footage of the site and expected minimum length of occupancy,\\namong other considerations.\\n\\nSustainability Champions\\nIn fiscal 2021, we appointed sustainability champions within our largest\\noffices globally to help implement green office best practices and formally\\nincorporated this responsibility into their personal development plans.\\nChampions conduct benchmarking to identify areas for improvement and\\npartner with key stakeholders at their local office to implement best practices.\\nChampions are also encouraged to engage fellow employees in sustainability\\nefforts through education and events.\\nIn fiscal 2021, there were nearly 40 champions representing more than 35\\noffices worldwide. In the future, we plan to assign a sustainability champion\\nfor each new office opened or new floor acquired or renovated in a building.\\n\\nRetail Design\\nIn fiscal 2021, we launched a set of Sustainability Practices for Retail Design\\nto help brands, regions, functions, and channels to deploy sustainability\\npractices for store design, visual merchandising, and retail spaces. The\\ndocument outlines core and additional sustainability practices for new store\\ndesign and visual merchandising.\\n\\nVisual Merchandising\\nVisual merchandising in our stores, as well as in department stores and\\nother locations, is used to surprise and delight consumers by highlighting new\\nproducts and trends. As a result, updates to these displays can be frequent.\\nWe have processes in place to help reduce environmental impacts, including:\\n• Using recyclable or recycled content. We leverage our materials scoring\\nframework to select more sustainable materials by replacing virgin plastics\\nwith paper and materials that can be curbside recycled, as possible.\\n• Designing for end of life in mind. We design our displays using materials\\nand fabrication methods for ease of disassembly and recycling.\\n• Applying more responsible packing and transport practices. We optimize\\npacking and transportation design to reduce freight weight, which lowers\\nour GHG emissions and packaging waste.\\nIn fiscal 2021, we held a supplier sustainability day focused on innovative\\nand sustainable solutions within the retail space for our internal teams and\\nexternal stakeholders. Our objectives were to share our sustainability goals\\nwith our suppliers and understand how we can work collaboratively with\\nthem to innovate for new and sustainable solutions. We also invited suppliers\\nto present forward-looking options to help us achieve our ambitions.\\n\\n63\\n\\nMINIMIZING THE IMPACT\\nOF MATERIALS\\nOne of the biggest areas of environmental\\nimpact at stores and counters comes from the\\nmaterials used to design and outfit the spaces.\\nTo help our designers make more sustainable\\nchoices when selecting furniture and finishes\\nfor retail spaces, we have developed a robust\\nmaterial scoring framework that provides a\\nrating for each material. Scores are based on\\ncriteria such as material composition and\\nhuman health and end-of-life considerations.\\n\\n\\x0c SUSTAINABILITY CLIMATE AND ENVIRONMENT\\n\\nVALUE CHAIN (SCOPE 3 EMISSIONS)\\nWe recognize that a significant portion of our climate impact extends beyond the boundaries of our own operations. We are taking\\nsteps to understand and manage these impacts.\\n\\nCDP Supply Chain\\nCDP is a nonprofit that runs a global disclosure reporting system to provide information to investors about companies’ environmental\\nimpacts. CDP also enables companies to track the impacts of their suppliers through a supply chain-specific questionnaire. In fiscal\\n2021, we joined CDP Supply Chain and requested that more than 200 suppliers respond to the CDP Climate questionnaire. Collectively,\\nthese suppliers represent a significant amount of our total spend. We will use this supplier-provided data to help us calculate a portion\\nof our Scope 3 footprint. In addition, we plan to use our suppliers’ responses to identify potential areas of opportunity and collaboration.\\n\\nReducing Emissions From Our Online Business\\nOur products are sold globally through our own websites, third-party platforms, and websites of our retailers. In the past two fiscal\\nyears, our online business* has nearly doubled, and we have continued to invest to support this growth. We have also strengthened\\nand refocused our online sustainability strategy. One of the pillars of the strategy is emission reductions from transportation for\\ndirect-to-consumer sales made on our brand sites and third-party platforms.\\nIn fiscal 2021, Aveda launched carbon-neutral shipping in the United States, procuring enough carbon emissions offset credits to\\ncover online delivery emissions to consumers. This project built on the success of the fiscal 2020 pilot, which offset shipping during\\nEarth Month. Taking the program global, Aveda launched carbon-neutral shipping in Belgium and the Netherlands in the fourth\\nquarter of fiscal 2021.\\n\\nTravel Retail Sustainability Goals\\nIn fiscal 2021, we announced sustainability goals specific to our Travel Retail business. Travel Retail, which covers the world of\\nduty-free environments including airports, downtown locations, airlines, cruises, and border shops, is one of our highest growth\\nchannels and touches more than 1 billion consumers a year.\\nIn line with our company-wide sustainability goals, we identified emissions, waste, and energy as key priorities for Travel Retail based\\non industry need and potential impact. For example, by eliminating film-wrapping from the packaging of Travel Retail Exclusive Sets,\\nwe can avoid 54,000 kilograms (kg) of plastic waste—the equivalent of eliminating nearly 5.4 million 500 milliliters (ml) of plastic\\nwater bottles (based on fiscal 2020 sales volumes).\\nWe are already making progress toward Travel Retail packaging and store design goals. In store design, the Estée Lauder, La Mer,\\nand M·A·C counters at Hyundai COEX in Seoul, Korea, were built with, on average, 80% reused display fixtures, reducing waste and\\nenvironmental impact while maintaining brand equity.\\nRead more about our Travel Retail goals.\\n\\nAWARD-WINNING SUSTAINABLE BEAUTY\\nIn fiscal 2021, Aveda was recognized by Elle Magazine for its\\ncarbon-neutral shipping program, receiving a Green Beauty\\nStar Award. The Green Beauty Star Awards honor companies,\\nproducts, programs, and people innovating for a cleaner,\\ngreener, more sustainable beauty industry.\\n\\n64\\n\\n*Online sales discussed throughout includes sales of our products from our websites and third-party platforms, as well as estimated sales of our products sold\\nthrough our retailers’ websites.\\n\\n\\x0c SUSTAINABILITY CLIMATE AND ENVIRONMENT\\n\\nWASTE\\nOur facilities follow the waste-minimization hierarchy—reduce, reuse, and recycle—and look for\\nopportunities to share best practices. If waste cannot be reused or recycled, it is converted to energy\\nby licensed power plants or by co-processing at cement kilns. Our facilities manage electronic waste\\nin accordance with our company policies that are based on applicable environmental regulations\\nfor recycling.\\nIn fiscal 2021, we again achieved zero industrial waste-to-landfill for 100% of our global manufacturing,\\ndistribution, and innovation sites*. Going forward, we plan to continue to maintain this commitment status.\\n\\nREDUCING PLASTIC PALLET WRAP\\nAt our manufacturing and distribution facilities, pallets containing boxes\\nare wrapped in stretch wrap film to prepare the boxes for shipment. The\\nfilm is low density polyethylene (LLDPE) and, based on the location of\\nthe facility, there is not always a viable recovery option. We are addressing\\nthe use of plastic stretch wrap film with two pilot projects:\\n• In fiscal 2021, we began collaborating on a project with some members\\nof the Ellen MacArthur Foundation Network to design and pilot a circular\\nbusiness-to-business (B2B) product protection solution for transporting\\nbulk shipments that eliminates single-use plastic stretch wrap film. This\\ncross-sectoral group is focused on researching and piloting three different\\npathways to eliminate single-use stretch wrap used in a linear path:\\nreplacing stretch plastic with a compostable film; implementing reusable\\nmaterials for securing pallets; and improving the recovery of single-use,\\nlinear plastic-based film for higher value and closed loop recycling\\nsolutions. It is anticipated that the pilots and results will be detailed in\\na white paper to be published in spring of 2022.\\n• Additionally, we began piloting a sustainable load containment system\\nthat reduces the use of stretch wrap film by 30%. After using the system\\nfor one month in a busy distribution center, we were able to reduce\\nstretch wrap film by 34% per pallet.\\n65\\n\\n*Does not include DECIEM site acquired in May 2021.\\n\\nINNOVATING FOR REDUCED PRODUCT WASTE\\nFor nearly 10 years, we have worked with g2\\nRevolution, an organization that takes difficult-torecycle items and finds new ways to reuse them.\\nNearly every one of our freestanding stores in the\\nUnited States* transfers their unsold products and\\ntesters to g2 Revolution, which then uses them as\\ningredients to make other products. In fiscal 2021, we\\nwere able to divert nearly 23,000 pounds of waste.\\n*Does not include freestanding stores in California.\\n\\n\\x0c SUSTAINABILITY CLIMATE AND ENVIRONMENT\\n\\nWATER\\nWe use water as an ingredient to make our products, as well as for\\ncleaning and cooling manufacturing equipment. In addition, our R&D\\nand Quality teams rely on water to perform testing, analyses, and to\\ndevelop new products. We have water-savings initiatives in place,\\nwhere possible. We pay close attention to facilities in water-stressed\\nareas, implementing measures to help manage our supply and water\\nuse responsibly.\\nOur green building standards have water efficiency requirements\\nthat all new facilities must meet, such as the installation of low-flow\\nfixtures. For sites pursuing LEED certification, indoor and outdoor\\nwater-use reduction is required.\\n\\n66\\n\\n\\x0c SUSTAINABILITY CLIMATE AND ENVIRONMENT\\n\\nIn fiscal 2021, we developed a water stewardship strategy in alignment with\\nthe Alliance for Water Stewardship, an international organization committed to the\\nsustainability of water resources. This strategy prioritizes our largest manufacturing\\nfacilities in water-stressed regions and is supported by an increased focus on\\nefficiency and implementation of best practices for water management and capital\\nprojects. As part of the strategy, we:\\n\\nUpdated the water risk assessment for our manufacturing sites and select innovation\\nsites. The purpose of the assessment is to evaluate physical, social, and regulatory\\nrisks and water stress at the watershed level. We refreshed the baseline water risk\\nscreening assessment for our global manufacturing and innovation sites to reflect\\nupdated data in the World Resources Institute (WRI) Aqueduct Water Risk Atlas\\nand to incorporate global subject matter expertise. The updated assessment confirms\\nthat our Melville, New York, facilities remain in a water-stressed region.\\n\\nCompleted a source water vulnerability assessment at our Northtec campus in Bristol,\\nPennsylvania. The source vulnerability assessment examines the physical, regulatory,\\nand social components of the local water supply and identifies potential\\nvulnerabilities within the local watershed. Based on this analysis, the watershed and\\ngroundwater basin were determined to be adequate. There are occasional threats\\nto the water supply from events such as droughts or severe storms; however, the\\nassessment did not uncover persistent water availability concerns.\\n\\nCompleted water conservation studies at our Agincourt and Whitman facilities\\nin the United Kingdom to identify opportunities for efficiency, optimization,\\nautomation, and improved cleaning practices. These inputs inform facility water\\nconservation plans.\\n\\nOur 2020 CDP Water score was an A-, due in part to our efforts to expand our\\nglobal water accounting and conduct a Source Water Vulnerability Assessment for\\nour Melville campus (in fiscal 2020), among other initiatives.\\nRead more about our approach to water management in our CDP Water response.\\n\\n67\\n\\n\\x0c SUSTAINABILITY RESPONSIBLE SOURCING\\n\\nSUSTAINABILITY\\n\\nRESPONSIBLE\\nSOURCING\\nWE SOURCE INGREDIENTS AND MATERIALS\\nFROM AROUND THE WORLD.\\nOur teams work diligently to source ingredients responsibly and with\\nattention to potential impacts on people and environment. We aim\\nto continuously strengthen our sourcing practices while remaining\\nsensitive to the local communities in which we operate.\\n\\n68\\n\\n\\x0c SUSTAINABILITY RESPONSIBLE SOURCING\\n\\nOUR MANAGEMENT APPROACH\\nThe success of our responsible sourcing efforts depends on collaboration with our wide and diverse\\nnetwork of global suppliers. We aim to develop long-lasting, trusting, and mutually beneficial\\nrelationships with suppliers that share our strong values and demonstrate the same commitment\\nto operating responsibly and ethically.\\nOur Responsible Sourcing team is part of our Global Procurement function and works closely with\\nthe Research and Development (R&D), Global Corporate Citizenship and Sustainability, Packaging,\\nand Legal functions. The team establishes, implements, and monitors environmentally and socially\\nresponsible and ethical sourcing practices to ensure that performance is aligned with our goals and\\nobjectives. We collaborate with our brands, suppliers, industry groups, and peers to continuously\\nadvance our practices.\\n\\nSUPPLIER DIVERSITY\\n\\nSUPPLIER CODE OF CONDUCT\\n\\nAs an inclusive and diverse company, we are focused on\\nbroadening our purchasing choices to better support suppliers\\nrepresenting LGBTQIA+, veterans, ethnic minorities, and\\npeople with disabilities, among other populations. Additionally,\\nwe have placed a specific focus on women- and Black-owned\\nbusinesses. Our objective is to help drive economic development\\nand growth of diverse and small businesses in the supplier base.\\n\\nOur Supplier Code of Conduct (the Code) is the foundation\\nof our Responsible Sourcing program. It outlines our expectations\\nfor suppliers with respect to human rights,the rights of\\nindigenous peoples, and local communities, as well as the\\nworkplace. The Code is organized into three sections:\\n\\nOur membership in international, national, and local advocacy\\ngroups allows us to contribute to the social and economic\\nadvancement of diverse businesses. We are members of the\\nfollowing organizations, which help us to expand our network\\nof opportunities:\\n• National Minority Supplier Development Council, a membership\\nassociation that advances business opportunities for certified\\nminority business enterprises and connects them to corporate\\nmembers.\\n• The Women’s Business Enterprise National Council,\\na nonprofit organization dedicated to helping women-owned\\nbusinesses thrive.\\n• WEConnect International, a global network that connects\\nwomen-owned businesses to qualified buyers around\\nthe world.\\nIn fiscal 2021, we further invested in this work by appointing\\na Director of Supplier Inclusion and Diversity dedicated solely\\nto supplier diversity. This role is responsible for expanding\\nour network of diverse suppliers, leveraging our association\\nmemberships, and driving progress toward our supplier\\ndiversity commitments.\\n\\nDIVERSE SUPPLIER SPEND\\n\\n$217M\\n$22M\\n69\\n\\nSpend with diverse and / or small suppliers\\nin fiscal 2021\\nSpend with Black-owned businesses in the\\nUnited States\\n\\n• Engage in lawful and ethical business practices\\n• Promote a respectful, fair, and diverse workplace\\n• Provide a safe, healthy workplace and protect the\\nenvironment and community.\\nIt covers areas including Confidentiality and Privacy, Fair\\nCompetition, Child Labor, and Forced Labor, among others. To\\nmeet the needs of our diverse and global network of suppliers,\\nthe Code is available in several languages.\\nOne of our Responsible Sourcing Program requirements is\\nfor suppliers to acknowledge the Code. Currently, suppliers\\nrepresenting more than 95% of our direct spend have done\\nso. Direct suppliers are those that provide raw materials,\\ningredients, packaging, and Third-Party Manufacturing to\\nthe Company.\\nIn addition to the Code, our Supplier Sustainability Guidelines\\nprovide suppliers with practical actions they can take to manage\\nthe environmental and social impacts of their own operations.\\nThese Guidelines help them to build on the foundation of the\\nCode requirements and move towards implementing improved\\npractices in sustainability.\\nDownload the Supplier Code of Conduct\\nSustainability Guidelines.\\n\\nand Supplier\\n\\n\\x0c SUSTAINABILITY RESPONSIBLE SOURCING\\n\\nSUPPLIER EVALUATION AND MONITORING\\nWe monitor our suppliers to ensure adherence to the Code and pay careful attention to potential risks. We conduct risk assessments\\nand perform due diligence on select direct and indirect suppliers. We also monitor supplier performance and implement corrective\\naction plans as needed.\\nWe use EcoVadis, an online ratings service, to help us assess suppliers on environmental impact, labor and human rights, ethics,\\nand sustainable procurement practices. The tool ranks suppliers with numerical scores that reflect the maturity level of their sustainability\\nprograms, practices, and initiatives. In fiscal 2021, we rolled out the platform to more than 180 additional suppliers, bringing the\\ntotal number of direct and indirect suppliers using it to more than 750.\\nWe require our key strategic partners to achieve an “advanced” score and expect other suppliers to achieve at least a “satisfactory”\\nscore. We engage with suppliers who do not achieve a “satisfactory” score to help them improve, and we reassess them each year\\nuntil they meet the “satisfactory” requirement. In fiscal 2021, more than half of strategic suppliers improved their EcoVadis scorecard\\nperformance from their previous assessment.\\n\\nSUPPLIER RISK ASSESSMENT\\nWe risk-rank suppliers globally based on pre-established criteria, such as the location of the operations, type of material being\\nsourced, and potential impact to our business. Based on the risk ranking of the supplier, we conduct additional due diligence using\\nthird-party audits and assessments, including on-site audits. To help us determine country risk, we use a third-party company that\\nassesses each country based on its approaches to social impact and sustainability topics including environment, health and social\\nissues, corruption, and human rights risks.\\n\\nINDIRECT SUPPLIERS\\nAs we deepen our commitment to responsible sourcing, we have furthered our efforts to include our indirect supply chain. Our\\nindirect supply chain is composed of suppliers who sell us goods and services not directly used in the manufacturing of our products.\\nWe have extended our supplier risk assessment to include our indirect suppliers and apply criteria such as the type of goods or services\\nbeing procured, the location of the operations, and the supplier’s annual spend. Based on the risk ranking of the supplier, we conduct\\nadditional due diligence using third-party audits and assessments.\\nIn fiscal 2021, we rolled out the EcoVadis platform to select indirect suppliers to support evaluation and monitoring. Leveraging our\\nsupplier risk assessment, we plan to extend additional invitations to suppliers (both direct and indirect) in the coming years to provide\\ninsights into their operations through EcoVadis. We are focused on follow-up and education to help indirect suppliers understand the\\nimportance of the tool and the value it brings in establishing a foundation for improving their environmental and social performance.\\n\\nPROGRESS TOWARD\\nOUR GOALS\\nGOAL:\\nAs part of our continuous efforts to address issues that\\nmay exist within complex supply chains, by the end of\\ncalendar year 2025 we will have identified sensitive\\ningredient supply chains and developed robust biodiversity and social action plans for them.\\nWe have identified a number of ingredients as\\npriorities and have developed and are implementing\\nbiodiversity and social action plans. As part of\\nour ongoing review, we continue to develop and\\nimplement action plans as per our prioritization\\nprocess. More than 90% of our spend with suppliers\\nof sensitive ingredients is covered under EcoVadis,\\nproviding enhanced visibility into the environmental\\nand social performance of these suppliers.\\n\\n70\\n\\nPercentage of new suppliers screened using\\n100% environmental\\nand social criteria in fiscal 2021\\nof strategic suppliers screened using\\n100% Percentage\\nenvironmental and social criteria in fiscal 2021\\nof third-party on-site supplier audits conducted\\n52 Number\\nin fiscal 2021\\n*\\n\\n**\\n\\n*Suppliers are those that provide direct raw material, ingredient, packaging, and\\nThird-Party Manufacturing to ELC.

We manage our portfolio thoughtfully with respect to the social,\\nenvironmental, and economic implications of our sourcing.\\nWe use more than 4,000 ingredients in manufacturing our products. We have a process to identify and prioritize sensitive ingredients\\nfor which we believe it would be beneficial to develop biodiversity or social action plans. A sample of the ingredients for which we have\\ndeveloped actions plans include Australian sandalwood, mica, palm, shea and vanilla.\\nWhile the biodiversity and social action plans vary depending on the ingredient, examples of actions we are taking include,\\nbut are not limited to:\\nConsolidating spend with\\nstrategic suppliers who\\npromote best practices\\nregarding biodiversity\\npreservation and social\\nimpact programs\\n\\nPiloting proof-ofconcept projects to\\naddress traceability\\n(e.g., blockchain) while\\nevaluating opportunities\\nto scale up these projects\\nfor greater impact\\n\\nImplementing projects\\nto positively impact\\nsourcing communities\\n(addressing social,\\nenvironmental, and\\nmarket challenges)\\n\\nExploring certification\\noptions and other\\napplicable third-party\\nschemes for relevant\\ningredients\\n\\nLeveraging EcoVadis\\nto continue to enable\\nsuppliers to improve\\ntheir performance\\n\\nSUPPORTING WOMEN IN THE SUPPLY CHAIN\\nIn fiscal 2021, we completed a two-year program as part of the HERproject\\nto strengthen and improve conditions for female workers at two of our\\npackaging suppliers in China. The program included training sessions and\\nworkplace interventions that targeted health and gender equality goals. As\\npart of the program, 2,000 individuals were trained, including 1,500 women\\nand 68 peer educators.\\nAt the close, participants were surveyed to measure impact of the program.\\nResults showed increased awareness of key health issues and health behavior,\\nincluding recognizing adverse pregnancy symptoms and understanding the\\nimportance of regular self-examination for breast cancer.\\nParticipants also showed an increase in positive attitudes towards gender\\nequality issues such as equal delegation of household chores. Self-esteem and\\nconfidence in communication also improved, which is beneficial for both the\\nindividual employee and for the performance of the whole factory. We are\\ncurrently assessing additional suppliers to determine where we can implement\\nsimilar manufacturing-based programs.\\n“We think all women would enjoy being part of this program. It’s beneficial\\nfrom a health perspective and the activities enrich the workplace experience.”\\n–HERproject participant\\n71\\n\\n\\x0c SUSTAINABILITY RESPONSIBLE SOURCING\\n\\nSHEA\\nShea butter is an important ingredient in many of our products, used as a softening\\nand moisturizing agent. It is often listed on our ingredients label as Butyrospermum\\nParkii (Shea Butter), in reference to the tree that produces the shea nut. Shea trees\\ngrow naturally in the wild in central Africa, and shea nuts are typically harvested\\nby women.\\nIn fiscal 2021, we joined the Global Shea Alliance, a nonprofit industry association\\nthat promotes sustainability, quality practices, and standards for shea in food and\\ncosmetics. Building on our long-held commitments to both women and sustainability,\\nwe are dedicated to engaging in industry collaboration to help generate positive\\nimpact on the ground.\\n\\nHERproject\\nHERproject is an initiative that focuses on empowering women who work\\nwithin supply chains. It is organized by BSR, a global nonprofit business network\\nand consultancy dedicated to sustainability. Building on a successful two-year\\nHERproject program that we completed in our packaging supply chain in fiscal\\n2021, we are expanding the program with BSR into agriculture, targeting shea.\\nWomen involved in agriculture in many countries may face challenges related\\nto access to and control over resources, training, and education. HERproject is\\naddressing these needs by empowering and building the capacity of women. The\\nprogram also strengthens cooperative capacity (between men and women) to\\nsupport women producers.\\nThe model is being developed and piloted in Ghana through a grant from The\\nEstée Lauder Companies Charitable Foundation. The program will draw on existing\\nHERproject curriculum modules such as gender awareness, communication skills,\\nproblem solving, financial planning, and taking care of one’s health. The objective\\nis to develop a bespoke HERproject model for the agricultural sector that may\\nserve as a blueprint across our ingredients, as well as become available to the\\nwider beauty industry.\\n\\n“ of the evolution of our\\nBSR’s HERproject is proud\\npartnership with The Estée Lauder Companies’ Charitable\\nFoundation (ELCCF). ELCCF’s support enables HERproject\\nto enter new frontiers, deepen our work, and empower more\\nwomen in global supply chains. Our collaboration in Ghana\\nrepresents the first expansion of HERproject into West Africa\\nand the ingredient supply chain connected to the beauty\\nindustry, and it underscores The Estée Lauder Companies’\\ncommitment to responsible sourcing and to empowering women\\nin its supply chain.\\n“\\n\\nCHRISTINE SVARER\\nDirector, HERproject, BSR\\n\\n72\\n\\n\\x0c SUSTAINABILITY RESPONSIBLE SOURCING\\n\\nVANILLA\\n\\nMICA\\n\\nWe seek to increase transparency and traceability within our\\nmost complicated and sensitive supply chains, such as vanilla,\\nwhich we use as a fragrance in products across our portfolio.\\nIn fiscal 2021, we completed the second year of a pilot program\\nin which our Responsible Sourcing team and Aveda used\\nblockchain technology to trace our Madagascan vanilla supply\\nchain from harvest through production. Using digital ID cards,\\nunique identification codes via a QR reader, and mobile\\nphones, product and producer information was recorded on\\na blockchain, forming a traceable chain of custody.\\n\\nMica is used in some cosmetics to provide a pearlescent\\neffect. We continue to engage with stakeholders in India to\\naddress the risk of child labor in the mica supply chain.\\nFor example, since 2005, we have partnered with the Kailash\\nSatyarthi Children’s Foundation (KSCF). KSCF works to eliminate\\nchild labor in India by partnering with local communities to\\ndevelop proactive and sustainable solutions, including through\\nthe creation of Bal Mitra Grams or Child Friendly Villages.\\n\\nIn September 2021, Aveda launched a consumer facing website\\nexperience to explain blockchain and why it matters, as well as\\nshow the journey of their blockchain vanilla from Madagascar\\nto France to Minnesota via a mapping tool.\\n\\nIn fiscal 2021, our work with KSCF pivoted in response to the\\ndevastating impact of COVID-19 within India, allowing resources\\nto be redirected to meet the immediate needs of children and\\nfamilies impacted by the pandemic. Read more on page 49.\\n\\nRESPONSIBLE SOURCING OF FOREST COMMODITIES\\nOur No Deforestation, No Peat, No Exploitation (NDPE) Policy explicitly outlines our\\nexpectations for our raw material suppliers regarding no deforestation and no\\nconversion. The policy is based on criteria from The Accountability Framework,\\na set of common norms and guidance for establishing, implementing, and monitoring\\nethical supply chain commitments in agriculture and forestry.\\nWe have begun a due diligence process to ensure compliance with the policy, in\\naddition to conducting key commodity supplier assessments. These assessments will\\nfurther inform commodity-specific action plans for specific ingredients. In fiscal 2021,\\nwe published our Palm Action Plan.\\nIn addition to maintaining forestry standards for our manufactured products, we have\\na goal calling for 100% of our forest-based fiber packaging cartons to be FSC-certified\\nby the end of calendar year 2025. Learn more on page 87.\\nOur brands also support environmental causes, including a commitment to help\\nsafeguard the health of forests for future generations. For example, Origins has long\\nsupported environmental nonprofit organizations that support tree planting efforts,\\nhelp restore ecosystems, benefit local communities, and fight climate change.

Palm oil derivatives refer to the final ingredients\\ncreated from palm oil that are used in our products, such as surfactants, emulsifiers, and emollients. They are odorless, with a smooth\\nand creamy texture that makes them a beneficial ingredient to use in our formulations.\\nIn calendar year 2020, we purchased approximately 3,600 metric tons of palm oil-based derivatives, which represent less than 0.01%\\nof the world’s annual production of palm oil-based derivatives. While this amount makes us a comparatively low-volume user of\\npalm-based ingredients relative to other sectors, we are committed to taking concrete action with our suppliers to build sustainable and\\nethical palm supply chains. Currently, 100% of our purchased palm-based ingredients are certified to Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil\\n(RSPO) standards for sustainable production*.\\n\\nROUNDTABLE ON\\nSUSTAINABLE PALM OIL (RSPO)\\nWe have been a member of RSPO,\\nthe leading convening body that\\ndevelops and sets the standards\\nfor sustainable palm oil and enables\\npalm oil certification, since 2014.\\nWe are also signatories to the\\nRSPO’s North American Sustainable\\nPalm Oil Network (NASPON)\\nCharter Agreement. NASPON\\nis a multi-stakeholder platform to\\ncollaborate, educate, inform, and\\nbuild momentum to help North\\nAmerican companies make and\\ndeliver on commitments to source\\nsustainable palm oil.\\n\\n74\\n\\n*Excludes palm-based ingredients not directly procured by The Estée Lauder Companies, such as those procured by Third-Party Manufacturers.\\n\\n\\x0c SUSTAINABILITY RESPONSIBLE SOURCING\\n\\nSUSTAINABLE PROCUREMENT\\nWe strive to source our palm-based ingredients responsibly and sustainably with\\nrespect for local communities and the environment. We do this by procuring\\ningredients from suppliers that can demonstrate adherence to the principles\\noutlined in our Supplier Code of Conduct and our No Deforestation, No Peat,\\nNo Exploitation (NDPE) Policy. Read our NDPE Policy here.\\nWe assess compliance with these policies through supplier performance,\\nincreased traceability, and third-party certification to RSPO’s Principles and\\nCriteria. We communicate our progress with respect to sustainable palm oil\\nprocurement on a yearly basis through the Annual Communication of Progress\\n(ACOP) in accordance with RSPO requirements.\\nWorking with Third-Party Manufacturers\\nWe have communicated to our Third-Party Manufacturers (TPMs) our\\nexpectation that they use palm-based ingredients that are from an RSPO\\nphysically certified sustainable source (Mass Balanced, Segregated, or Identity\\nPreserved). By influencing our suppliers, we make progress toward our goals\\nand help promote a stable and sustainable palm supply chain for others\\nMONITORING AND TRANSPARENCY\\nWe are a founding member of Action for Sustainable Derivatives (ASD). This\\nalliance of brands and suppliers aims to address responsible sourcing in the\\ncomplex palm derivatives supply chain by collaborating to harmonize approaches\\non transparency, risk monitoring, and evaluation. Through our membership in\\nASD, we are committed to establishing traceability to the point in the supply chain\\nwhere suppliers can demonstrate that the palm ingredients meet our sourcing\\nprinciples and collectively monitor and address grievances.\\n\\nPROGRESS TOWARD\\nOUR GOALS\\nGOAL:\\nBy the end of calendar year 2025, at least 90%\\nof our palm-based ingredients (palm oil and\\nits derivatives) will be certified sustainable from\\nRSPO physical supply chains (Mass Balance,\\nIdentity Preserved, or Segregated).*\\nIn calendar year 2020, 71% of our palm-based\\ningredients* were certified sustainable from\\nRSPO physical supply chains (Mass Balance\\nand Identity Preserved). In total, 100% of our\\npalm-based ingredients* are certified under one\\nof RSPO’s four certification types: Mass Balance,\\nIdentity Preserved, Segregated, or Book &\\nClaim. We are on track to meet our goal of\\n90% RSPO certification from physical supply\\nchains by end of calendar year 2025.\\n*Excludes palm-based ingredients not directly\\nprocured by The Estée Lauder Companies, such as\\nthose procured by Third-Party Manufacturers.\\n(TPMs) and certain acquired brands not yet fully\\nintegrated into the relevant ELC systems.\\n\\nAdditionally, through our ASD membership, we are able to leverage the\\ndynamic monitoring of our traced supply chain through a shared grievance\\ndashboard. Once a grievance is filed, the reports are reviewed and investigated.\\nIf substantiating evidence in support of a grievance is found, the grievance will\\nbe addressed through industry collaboration or through our own individual\\naction as a company.\\nWE PLAN ON CONTINUING OUR MONITORING AND TRANSPARENCY\\nEFFORTS BY:\\n• tracing our palm supply chain to achieve increased traceability to the\\nmill and beyond\\n• driving industry alignment through our partnership with ASD\\n• contributing to shared monitoring of risk, grievances, and continuous\\nimprovement plans, as needed.\\n\\nENHANCED VISIBILITY THROUGHOUT THE PALM VALUE CHAIN\\n\\n79% of our palm derivative volume is traceable to the mill level.\\n28% of our palm derivative volume is traceable to the plantation level.\\nin transparency of our palm supply (from 71% to 79%\\n8% increase\\nvolume traceable to mill).\\n75\\n\\n\\x0c SUSTAINABILITY RESPONSIBLE SOURCING\\n\\nCOMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT\\nMore than 3 million smallholder farmers produce more than 40% of global palm oil and rely on palm oil to support their livelihoods.\\nThese small-scale farmers face significant challenges, including limited access to markets and finance; lack of training on agricultural\\nbest practices, which leads to low productivity; and land tenure insecurity. Effectively addressing the challenges related to inclusive\\nsustainable palm sourcing requires collaboration among governments, civil society, local communities, and private enterprise.\\nWe are committed to supporting smallholder farmers by helping to build their capacity and improve their livelihoods with the goal of\\nincreasing their participation in the palm oil supply chain. Initiatives include:\\nPURCHASING INDEPENDENT SMALLHOLDER RSPO CREDITS\\nIndependent smallholder RSPO credits provide farmers the means to participate\\nin the global sustainable palm oil market. Purchasing smallholder credits provides\\nfarmers an opportunity to receive a premium for the sale of sustainable palm,\\nwhich provides them with additional funds to further invest in their businesses\\nand communities.\\nTo support smallholder farmers, we increased our purchase of RSPO Independent\\nSmallholder credits to represent just over 29% of our annual palm volumes in\\n2020 (up from 25% in fiscal 2020). Through these purchases, we supported groups\\ncontaining more than 2,200 independent smallholder palm oil farmers in\\nIndonesia and Malaysia.\\n\\nPROJECT LAMPUNG\\nIn 2019, we launched Project Lampung in partnership with Solidaridad,\\na global NGO; BASF, a long-term supplier; the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil;\\nBusiness Watch Indonesia; and the Indonesian Agency for Agricultural Extension,\\na local farmers association, to build the capacity of 1,000 smallholder farmers in\\nthe Lampung Province of Indonesia to produce sustainable palm oil and improve\\nincomes and livelihoods.\\nA key component of the project includes the development and training of farmers\\nin good agricultural and best management practices that protect the environment\\nand the health of workers. While the training program was delayed due to COVID-19,\\nmore than 50% of farmers participated in Farmer Field School training in fiscal 2021,\\nwith the remaining farmers to be trained by the end of calendar 2021, pending\\nCOVID-19 restrictions.\\n\\nMOSAIK INITIATIVE\\nIn fiscal 2021, The ELCCF approved and initiated a grant to ASD to kickstart an\\ninnovative pooled-funding model to generate large-scale positive impact on\\nthe ground in priority production landscapes.

Within R&D,\\nour Product Formulation team oversees all facets of\\nformulation including ingredient selection, formula\\ndesign, and qualification. Our Product Safety and\\nRegulatory Affairs team manages ingredient and\\nproduct safety, including management of our Safety\\nReview Process. Green chemistry is integrated into\\nour formula design efforts with Product Formulation\\nand Product Safety and Regulatory Affairs partnering\\nclosely to enable this work across our portfolio.\\n\\n79\\n\\n\\x0c SUSTAINABILITY PRODUCT FORMULATION\\n\\nPRODUCT SAFETY\\nPHILOSOPHY AND\\nPROCESS\\nWe evaluate each product for safety.\\nWe employ a sophisticated evaluation plan\\nthat incorporates a selection of relevant\\ntools, including, for example, a suite of tests\\nsuch as stability, sensory, safety-in-use,\\nand clinical tests, as well as ophthalmologist\\nand dermatologist testing. Our integrated\\nglobal R&D network constantly works to\\nadvance modern, scientific cosmetic testing\\nmethodologies.\\n\\nSAFETY REVIEW PROCESS\\n\\nANIMAL TESTING\\n\\nWhen we first begin to consider using an ingredient, we\\nevaluate it to be sure that it meets our safety standards and the\\nrequirements of governmental, regulatory, and scientific bodies\\naround the world. We then study all aspects of the ingredient.\\nIf needed, experiments are conducted in state-of-the-art in\\nvitro tests and/or computer-based models to further inform our\\nunderstanding of the ingredient’s safety profile.\\n\\nWe have worked globally to establish that product safety for\\ncosmetics can be determined via nonanimal, modern, and\\nscientific evaluation and methods—leveraging deep knowledge\\nof toxicology, skin biology, historical and current data, and\\nevaluations of cosmetic ingredients, while utilizing the most\\nup-to-date scientific methodologies, in silico, in vitro, and clinical.\\nMore than 25 years ago, we began using synthetic skin technology\\nto evaluate the effects of products on human skin and have been\\nupdating our methodologies ever since.\\n\\nThis ingredient information guides us as we formulate our products.\\nWe then evaluate the formula itself to assure the safety of the\\nfull formula, while comparing it to similar formulas within our\\nextensive database of clinical and safety data. Additional clinical\\nand in vitro testing may also be conducted among volunteer\\npanels to further confirm safety.\\nOnce the cosmetic formula meets our safety and quality\\nstandards, it is placed on the market for our consumers to enjoy.\\nWe continuously monitor feedback from our consumers,\\nallowing us to understand the impact of our products as they\\nare being used.\\n\\nWe seek to advance best practices within the industry\\nand enhance our collective knowledge of cosmetics and\\ncosmetics ingredients.\\n• We are members of the Personal Care Products Council,\\nwhich supports the work of the Cosmetic Ingredient Review.\\n• We also support the International Cooperation on\\nCosmetics Regulation.\\n80\\n\\nThe Estée Lauder Companies was one of the first cosmetics\\ncompanies to eliminate animal testing as a method of determining\\nproduct safety. We don’t test our products on animals, and we\\ndon’t ask others to test for us. We acknowledge our brands are\\nsold in countries where animal testing of cosmetics or cosmetic\\ningredients is required by law.\\nWe believe it is our responsibility to contribute to the sustainable\\nsolution to end animal testing for cosmetics and are proud to\\nwork with organizations advocating for practical solutions and\\nacceptance of alternatives to cosmetic animal testing. We invest\\nin university research programs, industry consortiums, and\\nnonprofits that champion a collaborative and effective approach.\\nFor more information on our Animal Testing policies, please visit\\nour website.\\n\\n\\x0c SUSTAINABILITY PRODUCT FORMULATION\\n\\nSERVING OUR DIVERSE CONSUMERS\\nProducts developed for our large portfolio of brands are designed to reflect the desires and preferences of our diverse global\\nconsumers. We continuously innovate in our product and experience design, with particular focus on formulation philosophy and\\naesthetics, including consideration for locally relevant, organic, or vegan ingredients, among others. We design and adapt our\\nproduct portfolio to the diversity of skin and hair physiology, tone, and types across skin care, hair care, and makeup for the most\\nrelevant and engaging selection of products.\\nAVEDA TRANSITIONS TO 100% VEGAN FORMULAS\\nInspired by the brand’s mission of care, fiscal 2021 marked a groundbreaking chapter in the evolution of Aveda: All of the brand’s hair\\ncare, hair color, body care, makeup, and aroma formulas are now 100% vegan. At Aveda, vegan formulas are those created without\\nany animal-derived ingredients.\\nAveda believes that its mission should be most clearly represented through its products, which is why formulating high-performance,\\n100% vegan formulas is of chief importance. It is also important to consumers, many of whom see the brand as a pioneer in responsible\\nbeauty. Aveda has been cruelty free since its inception in 1978 and strives to set an example for environmentally conscious leadership.\\n\\nAN INCLUSIVE PORTFOLIO\\nSkin Tone Color Palettes\\nBobbi Brown: Individual Beauty - In 1992, Bobbi Brown Cosmetics\\nchanged the face of beauty with its launch of a Foundation Stick that\\nwas intentionally created to enhance a variety of skin tones. The\\nbrand’s continued focus on undertone—the colors beyond the surface\\nthat form everyone’s unique skin color—has made Bobbi Brown\\nCosmetics a longtime leader in offering inclusive shades. By embracing\\ninclusivity from the start, Bobbi Brown set a new standard for diversity\\nin beauty.\\nM·A·C: Studio Fix Fluid - Making products inclusive of all skin tones has\\nalways been a priority for M·A·C. The brand originally developed its\\niconic Studio Fix foundation more than 30 years ago to better support\\nmodels with melanated skin at fashion shows. Studio Fix originally had\\na shade lineup of more than 40 products ranging from dark to light and\\ndeveloped for a range of skin undertones. It now includes more than 60\\nshades and the brand continues to update its palette to meet its diverse\\nconsumer needs.\\nHair Care Formulation\\nBumble and bumble continues to expand its offerings for all hair types,\\ntextures and style preferences. When reformulating its Curl Collection,\\nthe brand did extensive research with consumers of all curl patterns and\\nenlisted expert stylists and influencers to ensure peak performance.\\nBumble and bumble also partnered with NOBLE, the ELC Black Employee\\nResource Group (ERG), to conduct focus groups and test products. The\\nresult is a line of products with curl-loving oils and butters that caters to\\nall curl patterns and addresses key needs for curly consumers.\\n\\nSkin Care Formulation\\nThe Estée Lauder brand is committed to developing advanced skin\\ncare products that are effective across diverse ethnicities and skin tones.\\nIn formulating its radiance-boosting serum, the brand conducted\\nmulti-ethnic clinical and sensory testing to help affirm that Perfectionist\\nPro Rapid Brightening Treatment with Ferment 2 + Vitamin C serves a\\ndiverse range of consumers.\\n\\n81\\n\\n\\x0c SUSTAINABILITY PRODUCT FORMULATION\\n\\nGREEN CHEMISTRY\\nWe incorporate green chemistry principles in our\\nproduct development process. We have spent\\nmany years collaborating with experts in the field,\\nassessing our own internal capabilities, and\\ndeveloping tools to enable our teams to seamlessly\\nleverage green chemistry in their daily work.\\nOur approach encompasses ingredient scoring,\\ningredient innovation, and product design.\\nAlong side these processes, we focus our efforts\\non our talent. We continually train and empower\\nour chemists on green principles and practices\\nso that our collective mindset is to strive for\\nimproved green chemistry performance.\\nELC employee at our Research Park facility in Melville, New York\\n\\nGREEN SCORE PROGRAM AND GREEN\\nFORMULA DESIGN FRAMEWORK\\nOur Green Score program provides a quantifiable method for\\nour formulators to benchmark and inform their formulation\\nchoices based on the principles of green chemistry, specifically\\nthrough the lenses of human health, ecosystem health, and the\\nenvironment. We have assigned green scores to thousands of\\nour active ingredients and formulas.\\nTo design a finished product with a favorable green score\\ntakes skillful product formulation capabilities. Our Green\\nFormula Design Framework helps our formulators understand\\nthe nuances of combining ingredients based on their green\\nscores. It enables them to better evaluate green chemistry\\nimprovements for formulas while continuing to create the\\nhigh-performance products that our consumers expect.\\nWith the Green Score program now integrated across our\\nproduct development process, we have visibility into the green\\nscore for new product launches. This data are providing\\nvaluable insights that are guiding the evolution of the program.\\n\\n82\\n\\n\\x0c SUSTAINABILITY PRODUCT FORMULATION\\n\\nGREEN CHEMISTRY AND OUR VALUE CHAIN\\nWe continuously seek to advance our efforts for the benefit of our consumers and the business. Our green chemistry work\\nto-date has been focused on the formulations and ingredients over which we have direct control. Our approach has been to gain\\na thorough and strategic understanding of our own impacts before expanding into areas beyond our immediate sphere of influence.\\nAt the same time, we are committed to working with our suppliers, Third-Party Manufacturers, and newly acquired businesses to\\ninspire their work and promote transparency within the personal care products industry. To this end, in fiscal 2021, we began engaging\\nwith suppliers to understand how to better incorporate all ingredients into our Green Score program.\\nSCIENTIFIC ADVISORY BOARD\\nWe embrace a collaborative approach to green chemistry and work alongside other experts to advance the application of green\\nchemistry principles across industries. In fiscal 2021, we established a scientific advisory board to ensure that we benefit from, and\\ncontribute to, cutting-edge science from around the world. The board is composed of external experts from academia representing\\nkey global regions, including China, and with a reputation of excellence in green chemistry.\\nThe scientific advisory board meets annually to provide feedback on our green chemistry methodology, research, and strategy. The\\ncreation of the board is part of our overall commitment to rigorous scientific credentialing, which also encompasses publishing in\\npeer-reviewed journals, partnering with universities, and filing for patents (where appropriate).\\nISO 16128: % NATURAL AND % NATURALLY DERIVED\\nFormulating against external standards can be a helpful way to align\\nto well-established frameworks that are recognized and understood\\nby others. One example is the International Standards Organization\\n(ISO), which provides guidance for cosmetic formulators on how to\\ncalculate the percentage of natural and naturally derived ingredients\\nin their products through the ISO 16128 standards.\\nWe have developed and implemented standard operating procedures\\nto formulate using these standards. We have also developed a\\nself-service formulation tool and training program for our formulators.\\nBy the end of fiscal 2021, we had scored more than 6,200 formulas\\nagainst the ISO 16128 standards.\\nOur brands have been engaged with this process, with Aveda\\nproviding the groundwork for developing and leveraging these\\nstandards across the Company. Our other brands are leveraging this\\nwork and exploring the use of ISO 16128 for ingredient selection and\\nformulation strategy. For example, in fiscal 2021, the Estée Lauder\\nbrand launched its Supreme Bright collection, now formulated with\\n99% naturally derived Beautyberry Extract and Vitamin C.\\n\\nMOVING TO BIO-BASED BUTYLENE GLYCOL\\nButylene glycol (BG) is a clear, odorless liquid that helps ensure product stability over a wide range of temperatures, improves application,\\nand provides moisturizing properties. We use BG across our portfolio, in both skin care and makeup products.\\nIn many cases it requires more energy to create synthetically derived BG than bio-based BG, due to increased reliance on natural gas during\\nproduction processes. Synthetic BG also utilizes petroleum-based solvents, while bio-based BG is primarily derived from natural ingredients,\\nsuch as corn. Bio-based BG offers a more favorable green chemistry profile.\\nAs part of our commitment to green chemistry, we’ve partnered with Genomatica, an innovative ingredient supplier, who has created a\\none-step fermentation process that converts renewable plant sugars into a high-purity, bio-based BG. Genomatica won a U.S. Environmental\\nProtection Agency Green Chemistry award in 2020 for its pioneering fermentation techniques.\\nIn fiscal 2021, we began to use this bio-based BG in Dr. Andrew Weil for Origins™ Mega Mushroom Treatment Lotion, one of the brand’s\\nmost popular products. We will continue to innovate with this new ingredient during our developmental process for products that use BG.\\n83\\n\\n\\x0c SUSTAINABILITY PRODUCT FORMULATION\\n\\nOUR INGREDIENTS\\nWe select our ingredients for many reasons, including\\nsafety, efficacy, and sustainability. We work diligently\\nto ensure that our products are formulated to meet the\\nrequirements of governmental and regulatory bodies\\nand scientific standards wherever we sell our products,\\nas well as our own high-quality standards.\\nWe achieve these high-quality and safety standards\\nthrough rigorous selection and evaluation of the\\ningredients that we use in our formulations and through\\ncareful consideration of what we don’t use, even if\\npermitted by regulatory authorities. We are confident\\nin the safety and efficacy of our products and the\\ningredients we use.\\n84\\n\\nPROGRESS TOWARD\\nOUR GOALS\\nGOAL:\\nWe will develop a glossary of key ingredients that\\nincludes descriptions of the ingredients’ purpose and\\nwill make this information available online by the\\nend of calendar year 2025.\\nWe are committed to increased transparency\\nabout the ingredients in our products. In fiscal 2021,\\nseven brands—Bobbi Brown, Bumble & bumble,\\nEstée Lauder, Editions de Parfums Frédéric Malle,\\nGlamGlow, M·A·C, and Smashbox—published\\ningredient glossaries on their websites, bringing our\\ntotal to 11 (Aveda, Origins, Clinique, and La Mer\\nreleased ingredient glossaries in fiscal 2020).\\n\\n\\x0c SUSTAINABILITY PRODUCT FORMULATION\\n\\nTRANSPARENCY\\nOur ingredient palette is comprised of thousands of materials. We fully support providing more information to our consumers\\nabout the ingredients in our products and are developing new ways to share ingredient information.\\nWe have also published information on our corporate website pertaining to ingredients we use in some of our products that are\\nof interest to consumers, including: preservatives, phenoxyethanol, EDTA, and BHT. We plan to update our corporate website\\nwith additional ingredient information in the future. Our brands also leverage this information and may choose to link directly to\\nit from their brand sites.\\nPlease visit our Ingredient Philosophy page to learn more.\\nINGREDIENT GLOSSARIES\\nOur brands engage with consumers seeking product\\ninformation through online ingredient glossaries. These\\nglossaries enable consumers to learn more about the\\nkey ingredients in the products they love, the reasons\\nbehind the uses of those ingredients, and their benefits.\\nAn additional seven brands launched ingredient\\nglossaries in fiscal 2021, joining four brands that published\\nglossaries previously. Additionally, some brands, including\\nAveda, Bobbi Brown, Estée Lauder, Smashbox, and\\nLa Mer, have made their glossaries “shoppable”—enabling\\nconsumers to purchase products containing specific\\ningredients directly from the glossary itself.\\nConsumers have responded positively to the glossaries.\\nFor example, those who visited the glossary page on\\nOrigins’ website spent three times more time on the site\\noverall than those who didn’t; and visitors to the Bobbi\\nBrown glossary viewed more than 25% more pages than\\nthose who didn’t view the glossary.\\n\\nCLEAN BEAUTY\\nAt The Estée Lauder Companies, we are dedicated to helping our consumers make beauty choices that are right for them. We are committed\\nto increased transparency about the ingredients in our products, and we strive to formulate our products with safe ingredients that create the\\nbest results.\\nThere is no standard definition of clean beauty. Rather, brands and retailers define clean beauty in many ways; for example, by what ingredients\\nare not included in a formula. At The Estée Lauder Companies, some of our brands choose to formulate without certain ingredients as part of\\ntheir clean product positioning.\\n85\\n\\n\\x0c SUSTAINABILITY PACKAGING\\n\\nSUSTAINABILITY\\n\\nPACKAGING\\nTHE ICONIC PACKAGING ASSOCIATED WITH\\nOUR BRANDS HELPS US DELIVER A HIGH-TOUCH\\nLUXURY EXPERIENCE. AS WE INNOVATE TO\\nREDUCE OUR ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT, WE\\nHAVE A UNIQUE OPPORTUNITY TO HELP\\nTHE PRESTIGE BEAUTY SECTOR DEFINE WHAT\\nMORE SUSTAINABLE PACKAGING LOOKS LIKE\\nFOR DISCERNING CONSUMERS.\\nWe search for materials that meet performance requirements, deliver\\non our luxury offerings, and help us achieve our sustainability goals.\\nWe invest in packaging innovation to advance solutions not only for our\\nbrands, but also for the personal care and cosmetics industry at large.\\n\\n86\\n\\n\\x0c SUSTAINABILITY PACKAGING\\n\\nPROGRESS TOWARD\\nOUR GOALS\\nGOALS:\\nBy the end of calendar year 2025, 75-100% of our\\npackaging will be recyclable, refillable, reusable,\\nrecycled, or recoverable.\\nIn fiscal 2021, 59% of our packaging by weight is\\neither recyclable, refillable, reusable, recycled, or\\nrecoverable, increasing from 53% in fiscal 2019.\\nWe will increase the amount of post-consumer\\nrecycled (PCR) material in our packaging by up\\nto 50% by the end of calendar year 2025, from\\na fiscal 2019 baseline.\\nWe achieved this goal and reached 15% of PCR\\nmaterial in our packaging as of the end of fiscal 2021\\n(a greater than 50% increase from the fiscal 2019\\nbaseline of 8.7% PCR).\\nHaving achieved our original PCR goal ahead of\\nschedule, we have now set a more ambitious goal\\nto increase the total percentage of PCR material\\nin our packaging to 25% or more by 2025.\\nOur ambition is to use responsibly sourced paper\\nproducts whenever possible with a goal to have 100% of\\nour forest-based fiber cartons FSC certified by 2025.\\nIn fiscal 2021, 89% of our forest-based fiber cartons\\nwere FSC certified, increasing from 28% in fiscal 2019.\\n\\nOUR MANAGEMENT APPROACH\\nResponsibility for packaging lies with numerous teams throughout our organization. We share\\njoint accountability to embed sustainability innovation across the entirety of the packaging life cycle.\\nOur brands are responsible for developing their own packaging goals and strategies, aligned with\\ndriving commercial value creation. The Global Packaging Function is accountable for executing\\nthese strategies and collaborates with Marketing; Creative; Procurement; Environment, Health,\\nSafety + Sustainability; Regulatory; Global Public Affairs; Legal; and Global Corporate Citizenship\\nand Sustainability functions. From design to purchase of materials to marketing, attention to\\npackaging is vertically integrated throughout the enterprise.\\nPackaging developers function as sustainability champions and help brands stay up to date on the\\nmost relevant and innovative design principles. They incorporate sustainability into their designs\\nto align to our “5Rs” (recyclable, refillable, reusable, recycled, or recoverable) packaging goal.\\n\\n87\\n\\n\\x0c SUSTAINABILITY PACKAGING\\n\\nSUSTAINABLE PACKAGING GUIDELINES\\nWe remain at the forefront of prestige packaging development and work to influence the broader\\npackaging industry through engagement around innovative and more responsible solutions.\\nWe continually anticipate consumer needs, market shifts, and regulatory requirements, and embed\\nlearnings and best practice into our internal guidelines.\\n\\nIn Le Labo boutiques and at select department store counters, consumers can bring back their perfume bottle (50ml, 100ml and 500ml) and refill it to\\nreceive 20% off the retail price.\\n\\n88\\n\\n\\x0c SUSTAINABILITY PACKAGING\\n\\nOur Sustainable Packaging Guidelines contain an overview of our approach,\\ndefinitions, material selection guides, and FAQs. They outline our priorities,\\nwhich include:\\n• Reducing and removing packaging where possible\\n• Designing for reuse and refillability\\n• Building designed-in recyclability\\n• Increasing amounts of PCR material in packaging\\n• Replacing petroleum-based plastics with bioplastics (if the bioplastic can\\nbe recycled and does not contaminate traditional recycling streams).\\nIn fiscal 2021, we continued to upskill and educate employees and provided training\\non the Guidelines for our package developers, marketers, and procurement teams.\\nAlong with the Guidelines, we use additional tools to develop more responsible packaging. These include custom-developed\\nmethodologies to calculate the sustainability profile of various product-packaging formats and estimated associated GHG\\nemissions, as well as third-party reviewed life-cycle assessments, as needed, to provide a holistic view of a package’s impacts.\\n\\nSUSTAINABILITY IN NEW PRODUCT LAUNCH\\nThe early development and design phase of a product and package is a critical time\\nfor integrating consideration of potential environmental impacts. In fiscal 2021, we\\nredesigned our new product launch process to create more consistency and continuity,\\nwith sustainability principles woven in throughout. Brands are now asked to address\\nhow they will incorporate one of the 5Rs into new product packaging at the beginning\\nof the design phase, allowing progress to be tracked from the onset.\\nSECONDARY AND TERTIARY PACKAGING\\nThe intent of secondary and tertiary packaging is to protect the integrity of our products\\nwhile also providing a High-Touch experience. We are working to reduce the environmental\\nimpacts of shipping and its associated packaging, including by selecting more sustainable\\nmaterials and eliminating excess material and volume.\\nFor example, many brands now use dissolvable packaging peanuts in their shipping\\nboxes and have reduced the amount of paper used in mailers. In our Europe, Middle East,\\nand Africa (EMEA) region, new shipping boxes are free of plastic, tape, and unnecessary\\npaper, and branded inner boxes have been replaced with plain carton packaging that is\\nFSC certified. We are also teaching suppliers about our efforts to create more responsible\\nsecondary and tertiary packaging and look forward to continued collaboration.\\n\\n89\\n\\n\\x0c SUSTAINABILITY PACKAGING\\n\\nTRAINING\\nWe keep employees and suppliers up to date on sustainable packaging initiatives through regular\\ntrainings and communications. Our objectives are to share information, capture new ideas, and listen\\nto feedback so that we can continually evolve our programs and improve our outcomes. In fiscal\\n2021, we conducted numerous virtual sessions:\\nINTERNAL TEAMS\\nWe conducted two webinar training sessions on the\\nSustainable Packaging Guidelines, principles, tools,\\nand updates. Each training was attended by more than\\n100 employees across global regions and functions.\\nProvided small group (5-30 people) training sessions\\nfor our marketing, packaging, and creative teams on\\nthe process for making responsible packaging claims.\\n\\nSUPPLIERS\\nWe hosted a session that included representatives from\\nnearly 400 supplier representatives to review updates\\nmade to improve our sustainability data collection in\\nour supplier specification system.\\n\\nSESSIONS WITH EXTERNAL ORGANIZATIONS\\nWe held a virtual training seminar with the Sustainable\\nPackaging Coalition for more than 90 employees. Participants\\nselected training topics, such as sessions on ocean plastic,\\nadvanced recycling, and life-cycle analysis.\\nWe kept our teams up to date on environmental regulation\\nchanges and proposed changes through webinars with\\nexternal experts from Lorax EPI.\\n\\n90\\n\\n\\x0c SUSTAINABILITY PACKAGING\\n\\nADDRESSING PLASTIC USE\\nWe know that plastic use is among the most pressing sustainability issues today, and we\\nare committed to tackling virgin plastic use and working to minimize plastic waste.\\nWe have developed internal plastic guidelines to help drive the reduction of virgin and\\nnonrecyclable plastic in our packaging, products, offices, facilities, and retail spaces.\\nOur guidelines include options such as pursuing more sustainable alternatives to single-use\\nvirgin plastic packaging, replacing plastic applicators used in our retail stores with paper\\nor wood versions, reducing plastic water bottles and cutlery in our spaces, and reducing\\nvirgin and nonrecyclable plastic used in our visual merchandising.\\nAs part of our commitment, we have developed an enterprise- wide goal specific to our\\nvirgin-fossil-based plastic. We have also developed a more ambitious goal related to our\\nuse of PCR in packaging.\\nExcessive plastic waste in the environment is an issue that extends beyond our own\\nbusiness. In fiscal 2021, The Estée Lauder Companies Charitable Foundation (ELCCF) awarded\\na grant to Plastics for Change, a nonprofit whose mission is to empower one million informal\\nwaste collectors by providing fair market access through its platform.

One of the first projects\\ndeveloped was to bring advanced recycled tube packages to market.\\nOrigins is the first prestige beauty brand to leverage SABIC’s advanced recycling\\ntechnology to produce a tube made from previously difficult-to-recycle,\\npost-consumer mixed plastics material. The brand’s global best-selling mask,\\nClear Improvement™ Active Charcoal Mask, is now packaged in a tube composed\\nof a circular polymer resin made using SABIC’s certified circular polyethylene\\nand polypropylene advanced recycling technology. By using this recycling\\ntechnology, we are helping to drive innovation toward the goal of a circular\\nplastic economy.\\n\\nWHAT IS ADVANCED (CHEMICAL) RECYCLING?\\nTraditional recycling streams for plastics are limited, and plastics can only be\\nrecycled a finite number of times. Advanced recycling returns hard-to-recycle\\nplastic back to its basic chemical building blocks. Once the plastic has been\\nbroken down to its molecular state, it is then used to create high-performance\\nplastics akin to a virgin material. The use of advanced recycled material is an\\nexciting technological development to support our sustainable packaging goals\\nas this technology widens the scope of application in our packaging portfolio.\\n\\n91\\n\\nOUR NEW GOAL\\nIn fiscal 2021, we established a new goal\\nthat by the end of calendar year 2030, we\\nwill reduce the amount of virgin petroleum\\nplastic in our packaging to 50% or less.\\n\\n\\x0c SUSTAINABILITY PACKAGING\\n\\nPACKAGING INNOVATION IN ACTION\\nOur brands continue to enhance the sustainability profile of packaging within their portfolios.\\nIn fiscal 2021, highlights included:\\nCLINIQUE\\nLaunched PCR and bioresin blend in certain packages (bottles) and PCR in caps.\\n\\nORIGINS\\nLaunched tubes and caps made with at least 86% advanced recycled PCR, transitioned some products from plastic\\nto glass, and made a refillable package for certain products.\\n\\nSMASHBOX\\nRemoved tertiary carriers from finished goods to reduce packaging materials, launched holiday sets with FSC-certified\\npaperboard platforms instead of plastic, and launched PCR in some packages.\\n\\nAVEDA\\n80% of Aveda high-density polyethylene (HDPE) plastic bottles use a minimum of 80% PCR content and more than\\n85% of Aveda’s skin care and styling PET bottles and jars contain 100% post-consumer recycled materials. In fiscal 2021,\\nAveda also launched:\\n• A limited-edition shampoo bar in a 100% PCR FSC-certified fiber carton\\n• A new 350 ml mono-material tube with 65% PCR content (PP plastic), which is the highest percentage we have developed\\nto date in a mono-material tube.\\n\\nADVANCED NIGHT REPAIR: AN ICONIC PRODUCT\\nNOW IN GLASS\\nAligned to our objective to reduce plastic use, in fiscal 2021\\nour Estée Lauder brand launched the Advanced Night Repair\\nSynchronized Multi-Recovery Complex with the iconic bottle\\nreimagined, housed in a new, expertly crafted, recyclable glass\\nbottle. Switching the Advanced Night Repair Serum bottles\\nsold globally from plastic to glass avoids millions of plastic\\nbottles per year.\\n*Includes the following bottle sizes: 20 ml, 30 ml, 50 ml, 75 ml, 100 ml, 115 ml.\\n\\n92\\n\\n\\x0c SUSTAINABILITY PACKAGING\\n\\nINCREASING THE USE OF RECYCLED PLASTICS IN LUXURY\\nCOSMETICS PACKAGING\\nIn fiscal 2021, we entered into an agreement with Eastman, a specialty materials\\nprovider to enable us to begin incorporating packaging solutions enabled by\\nEastman’s molecular recycling technologies and portfolio of Renew resins with up\\nto 100% certified recycled content.* This is the first sustainability-based agreement\\nbetween Eastman and a major prestige beauty house and will help drive the\\nincreased use of recycled and/or recyclable plastics in luxury cosmetics packaging.\\n*The recycled content is achieved by allocating the recycled waste plastic to\\nEastman Renew resins using a mass-balance process certified by ISCC.\\n\\n“\\n\\nWe are proud to partner with The Estée Lauder Companies to\\nhelp them achieve their ambitious sustainability goals. Together,\\nwe can provide a shining example of what is possible today—not\\nyears in the future—to advance the circular economy.\\n\\n“\\n\\nSCOTT BALLARD\\nDivision President of Plastics, Eastman\\n\\n93\\n\\n\\x0c SUSTAINABILITY PACKAGING\\n\\nPRODUCT TAKEBACK PROGRAMS\\nWe work with our brands to develop takeback programs, where possible. These programs are subject to local recycling laws and\\nwaste jurisdiction and are highly complex in nature.\\n\\nBACK-TO-M·A·C\\nMore than 30 years ago, M·A·C created Back-to-M·A·C—\\na pioneering takeback program intended to help reduce\\nthe environmental impact of the brand’s packaging by\\nrecycling or recovering its iconic black (ABS) plastic packages\\nwhere possible. In locations where M·A·C has established\\nits takeback program*, consumers return their clean, empty\\nproducts to a participating M·A·C counter to be recycled;\\nwhat cannot be recycled is converted into energy.\\nIn regions like North America and EMEA, the brand partners\\nwith select vendors to help recover and recycle consumers’\\nclean, empty M·A·C product packaging. In EMEA, our\\nvendor can recycle select ABS plastic into new plastic that\\nis used in the production of items including coffee machines\\nand IT equipment. In North America, our vendors support\\nM·A·C with a closed loop system to recycle select ABS\\npackaging into material that can be used for new compacts.\\nIn North America, M·A·C has enabled the processing of\\nmore than 420,000 pounds of empty packages in fiscal 2021.\\n\\nAVEDA FULL CIRCLE\\nWhile a majority of Aveda products are recyclable at\\nhome, a handful of items—pumps, pouches, pots, small\\nbottles (less than 150 ml), samples, tubes, and makeup—\\nare not. In fiscal 2021, Aveda launched its Full Circle\\nTakeback Program in the United Kingdom and select\\nmarkets in Europe. This takeback program targets packaging\\nthat is not typically recyclable at curbside or through\\nmunicipal recycling programs.\\nConsumers receive either points in Aveda’s loyalty\\nprogram or discounts for each eligible product returned.\\nAveda collects the empties and passes them along to its\\nrecycling partner. The recycling partner recycles what\\nthey can, with any remaining materials being converted\\nto energy.\\n\\n94\\n\\n*At participating M·A·C counters in select markets, excluding California.\\n\\n\\x0c SUSTAINABILITY PACKAGING\\n\\nPARTNERING FOR\\nADVANCED SOLUTIONS\\nWe maintain a strong network of collaborators—companies, universities, and consortiums—to help\\nfurther our collective approach to more responsible packaging. For example, in fiscal 2021, students\\nfrom Georgia Tech University produced a white paper comparing plastics used for mascara wands.\\nThey have continued to conduct life-cycle analyses of the studied plastics in order to help us better\\nunderstand the impacts of different materials.\\n\\nWE ARE MEMBERS OF AND/OR PARTNERS\\nWITH THE FOLLOWING ORGANIZATIONS:\\nSUSTAINABLE PACKAGING INITIATIVE FOR COSMETICS (SPICE)\\nA cohort of organizations in the cosmetics industry dedicated to collectively\\nshaping the future of sustainable packaging.\\nELLEN MACARTHUR FOUNDATION\\nAn organization that brings together leaders and innovators in\\nbusiness, governments, and academia to contribute to society’s transition\\nto a circular economy.\\nASSOCIATION OF PLASTIC RECYCLERS (APR)\\nThe North American trade association representing companies who acquire,\\nreprocess, and sell the output of more than 90 percent of the post-consumer\\nplastic processing capacity in North America.\\nSUSTAINABLE PACKAGING COALITION (SPC)\\nA coalition that brings together businesses, educational institutions, and\\ngovernment agencies to collectively strengthen and advance the business case\\nfor more sustainable packaging.\\nSTRATEGIC MATERIALS\\nA leader in the recycling market, Strategic Materials processes recycled glass\\nand plastic for use in a wide array of products, creating efficiencies for our\\nconsumers while conserving earth’s natural resources.\\n\\n95\\n\\nCOLLABORATING TO TACKLE\\nDIFFICULT CHALLENGES\\nPackaging tubes are often made of multiple\\nlayers of different materials. Currently, there is\\nno infrastructure in practice and at scale to\\nrecycle packages that use multiple materials.\\nAs a member of Stina (formerly More Recycling),\\nwe engage with other member organizations\\nto develop ways to advance recycling of\\npackaging tubes. Stina is a nonprofit organization\\nthat provides programs and tools to help\\naccelerate the transition to a society that uses\\nresources responsibly.\\nAs a result of this collaboration, Aveda is\\ndeveloping plans to launch “recyclable ready”\\ntubes.* These tubes will be made with one\\nsingle material and developed in accordance\\nwith common recycling guidelines to facilitate\\nmore widespread recyclability.\\n*Aveda tubes smaller than 38.5 mm in diameter will not\\nbe recyclable ready due to their size.

The Estée Lauder Companies Inc.’s\\nmanagement is responsible for its assertion and for the selection of the criteria, which management\\nbelieves provide an objective basis for measuring and reporting on the metrics. Our responsibility is to\\nexpress a conclusion on management’s assertion based on our review.\\nOur review was conducted in accordance with attestation standards established by the American\\nInstitute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) in AT-C section 105, Concepts Common to All Attestation\\nEngagements, and AT-C section 210, Review Engagements. Those standards require that we plan and\\nperform the review to obtain limited assurance about whether any material modifications should be made\\nto management’s assertion in order for it to be fairly stated. A review is substantially less in scope than\\nan examination, the objective of which is to obtain reasonable assurance about whether management’s\\nassertion is fairly stated, in all material respects, in order to express an opinion. Accordingly, we do not\\nexpress such an opinion. We believe that our review provides a reasonable basis for our conclusion.\\nIn performing our review, we have complied with the independence and other ethical requirements of the\\nCode of Professional Conduct issued by the AICPA.\\nWe applied the Statements on Quality Control Standards established by the AICPA and, accordingly,\\nmaintain a comprehensive system of quality control.\\nGreenhouse gas (GHG) emissions quantification is subject to inherent measurement uncertainty because of\\nsuch things as GHG emissions factors that are used in mathematical models to calculate GHG emissions,\\nand the inability of these models, due to incomplete scientific knowledge and other factors, to accurately\\nmeasure under all circumstances the relationship between various inputs and the resultant GHG emissions.\\nEnvironmental and energy use data used in GHG emissions calculations are subject to inherent limitations,\\ngiven the nature and the methods used for measuring such data. The selection by management of\\nalternative acceptable measurement techniques could have resulted in materially different amounts or\\nmetrics being reported.\\nAs discussed in management’s assertion, The Estée Lauder Companies Inc. has estimated GHG emissions\\nfor certain emission sources for which no primary usage data is available.\\nThe preparation of the employee engagement and employee safety metrics requires management to\\nestablish the criteria, make determinations as to the relevancy of information to be included, and to make\\nassumptions that affect reported information. The selection by management of alternative acceptable\\nmeasurement techniques could have resulted in materially different amounts or metrics being reported.\\nBased on our review, we are not aware of any material modifications that should be made to\\nThe Estée Lauder Companies Inc.’s management assertion in order for it to be fairly stated.\\n\\nNew York, New York\\nOctober 27, 2021\\n\\nPricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, 300 Madison Avenue New York NY 10017\\nT: 646-471-3000, F: 813-286-6000, www.pwc.com\\n\\n118\\n\\n\\x0c INDEPENDENT ASSURANCE STATEMENTS\\n\\nTHE ESTÉE LAUDER COMPANIES INC.\\nMANAGEMENT ASSERTION\\nOVERVIEW\\nWith respect to the following metrics reported by The Estée Lauder Companies Inc.\\n(“ELC” or the “Company”) as of or for the year ended June 30, 2021 (fiscal 2021),\\nELC’s management asserts that such metrics, which are also included in the Fiscal 2021\\nSocial Impact and Sustainability Report metrics tables as identified by the “*” symbol,\\nare presented in accordance with the assessment criteria set forth below.\\nManagement is responsible for the completeness, accuracy, and validity of the metrics\\nand for the selection of the criteria, which management believes provide an objective basis\\nfor measuring and reporting on the metrics.

For sites that use natural gas that receive no fuel or cost data, the building square footage is used to\\nestimate usage based on similar sites’ usage intensities or average benchmark natural gas intensities. Commercial\\nBuildings Energy Consumption Survey (CBECS) natural gas intensity for office space is the primary default benchmark\\nused when no site-specific data is available for offices.\\nEstimations are performed on an annual, or for all missing months, basis, in order to estimate natural gas usage across\\nsites where natural gas usage was confirmed to be a fuel source.\\nFor fuel oil, in cases where actual fiscal 2021 usage amounts are unavailable, fiscal 2020 usage amounts are carried forward.\\n\\nScope 1:\\nTransport Fuels\\n\\nIf actual fuel usage amounts are unavailable, usage is estimated based on the available transport data. In the United\\nStates and Canada, gallons of fuel purchased is reported and used as assumed fuel usage. In the United Kingdom and\\nBelgium, lease agreements and fuel economy are reported and used to estimate annual mileage and fuel usage. In Brazil,\\nfor vehicles without reported usage, average kilometers driven per vehicle per year is reported and used to estimate fuel\\nusage. In all other countries with mobile fuel usage, a combination of total number of vehicles, mileage, and/or liters of\\nfuel used are reported and used to calculate fuel usage.\\n\\nScope 1:\\nMobile Refrigerants\\n\\nEstimations are performed to calculate mobile refrigerant usage for ELC owned and/or leased sales fleet vehicles. Estimates\\nare based on the total sales fleet vehicle count by country and average refrigerant recharge and loss per vehicle.\\n\\nScope 1:\\nStationary Refrigerants\\n\\nNo estimations are made for stationary refrigeration usage as recharge fluctuates year-over-year. Only ELC locations\\nwith operational control over their HVAC systems report actual refrigerant recharge (usage) data. In fiscal 2021, actual\\nrefrigerant usage was reported at ELC manufacturing and certain distribution and innovation locations.\\n\\nScope 2:\\nPurchased Electricity\\n\\nELC employs several methods to estimate electricity usage when actual activity data is unavailable. In some cases,\\nlocations provided their own estimates based on partial activity data, invoices, and cost data. In the case where\\nlocations are unable to provide relevant data (common for many ELC international leased office and free-standing stores),\\nthe preferred method of estimation is based on square footage of office, free-standing store, or salon space.\\n\\nScope 2: Purchased\\nDistrict Heating\\n\\nNo estimates were made for purchased district heating as actual data was available for all relevant locations.\\n\\nScope 2:\\nPurchased Steam\\n\\nEstimates are made using the CBECS intensity factor (kWh/ft2 per year) for purchased district heat for office locations.\\nThe factor was applied to the square footage of the relevant office locations to estimate the amount of purchased steam.\\n\\nEXCLUSIONS\\nEach year, we aim to refine our energy and GHG emissions metrics reported. Metrics exclude GHG emissions associated with refrigerant\\nsources at free-standing stores, salon, office, and certain regional distribution and innovation locations.\\n\\nUNCERTAINTY\\nGHG emissions quantification is subject to inherent measurement uncertainty because of such things as GHG emissions factors that\\nare used in mathematical models to calculate GHG emissions and the inability of these models, due to incomplete scientific knowledge\\nand other factors, to accurately measure under all circumstances the relationship between various inputs and the resultant GHG\\nemissions. Environmental and energy use data used in GHG emissions calculations are subject to inherent limitations, given the nature\\nand the methods used for measuring such data.\\n\\n125\\n\\n\\x0c REFERENCE LINKS\\n\\n126\\n\\nFY20 Form 10-K\\n\\nhttps://otp.tools.investis.com/clients/us/estee_lauder4/SEC/sec-show.aspx?FilingId=14366782&Cik=0001001250&Type=PDF&hasPdf=1\\n\\nGlobal Operations\\n\\nhttps://www.elcompanies.com/en/who-we-are/global-operations\\n\\nCulture and Values\\n\\nhttps://www.elcompanies.com/en/who-we-are/culture-and-values\\n\\nCode of Conduct\\n\\nhttps://www.elcompanies.com/en/our-commitments/working-with-our-suppliers/supplier-code-of-conduct%20\\n\\nCorporate Governance\\n\\nhttps://www.elcompanies.com/en/investors/corporate-governance/governance-principles\\n\\n2020 Proxy Statement\\n\\nhttps://media.elcompanies.com/files/e/estee-lauder-companies/universal/investors/earnings-and-financials/proxy-statements/elc-proxy-20.pdf\\n\\nNominating and Governance\\nCommittee Charter\\n\\nhttps://media.elcompanies.com/files/e/estee-lauder-companies/universal/investors/corporate-governance/governance-principles/nominating-and-governance-committee-charter-051719.pdf\\n\\nCorporate Governance\\nGuidelines\\n\\nhttps://media.elcompanies.com/files/e/estee-lauder-companies/universal/investors/corporate-governance/governance-principles/elc-corporate-governance-principles.pdf\\n\\nOnline form for inquiries\\nregarding this report\\n\\nhttps://www.elcompanies.com/en/news-and-media/contact-us\\n\\nApex Companies, LLC,\\nassurance letter\\n\\nhttps://media.elcompanies.com/files/e/estee-lauder-companies/universal/our-commitments/2020-cs-report/estee-lauder-companies-fy20-assurance-statement.pdf\\n\\nCDP Climate Response\\n\\nhttps://media.elcompanies.com/files/e/estee-lauder-companies/universal/our-commitments/2020-cs-report/elc-cdp-climate-change-questionnaire-2020.pdf\\n\\nCDP Water Response\\n\\nhttps://media.elcompanies.com/files/e/estee-lauder-companies/universal/our-commitments/2020-cs-report/elc-cdp-water-questionnaire-2020.pdf\\n\\nCDP Forests Response\\n\\nhttps://media.elcompanies.com/files/e/estee-lauder-companies/universal/our-commitments/2020-cs-report/elc-cdp-forest-questionnaire-2020.pdf\\n\\nPolitical Contributions\\n\\nhttps://www.elcompanies.com/en/our-commitments/viewpoints/political-engagement\\n\\n\\x0c\""
