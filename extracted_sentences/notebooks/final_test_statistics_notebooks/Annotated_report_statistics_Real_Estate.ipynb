outlined above were included in the scenario analysis, where they were assessed for likelihood and potential impact to our business under two different climate scenarios.', 'For the analysis, we selected two scenarios—business-as-usual and aggressive mitigation.', 'These two scenarios were based on the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s (IPCC) Sixth Assessment Report – Shared Socio-economic Pathways (SSPs).', 'The two models used were the best-case scenario (SSP1-2.6), where the global average temperature increases by less than 2°C, and a business-as-usual scenario (SSP5-8.5), where the average global temperature increases by more than 4°C by the end of the century.', 'As part of the analysis process, we conducted multiple workshops across our five regions—Africa, APAC, Europe, Latin America, and U.S. and Canada—to develop an understanding of how the top risks and opportunities may result in potential impacts under the two scenarios selected.', 'Where possible, we translated the top climate risks and opportunities into potential financial impact, using a series of facts and assumptions based on Company data and scientific literature.', 'For example, we investigated the potential impact of natural disasters (e.g., hurricanes, ice, windstorms, tornadoes, floods and wildfires) on our infrastructure assets.', 'Over the past five years, the resulting damage from extreme weather events is estimated at approximately $3 million per annum globally, reduced further to less than $1 million per annum after insurance payouts, and on average fewer than 30 of more than 220,000 communications sites across our portfolio are significantly affected annually.', 'When measured against our company-wide total net property and equipment of close to $20 billion, this represents less than a tenth of one percent of our total tower, equipment and other related property value.', 'During the scenario analysis, we utilized publicly available government-authored geographic information system data layers to better understand how the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events may change in the future.', 'The results of our scenario analysis show that extreme weather risk is expected to remain proportionally insignificant over the next 30 years.', 'Additionally, we assessed the risk of future sea level rise to our communications sites.', 'We collected the geographic coordinates of all sites and, using a proprietary tool from an independent organization of leading scientists, mapped our site locations against a model that combines sea level rise, land elevation and storm predictions to estimate future coastal flood threat.', 'The model is aligned with the IPCC scenarios and, as such, we were able to estimate potential exposure through 2050 under our two scenarios.', 'We considered a site at-risk if the model estimated the site would flood at least once every five years.', 'The proprietary tool is unable to discern between negligible and more significant flood events, so while a site may be considered at risk for floods, it is probable based on Company experience to date, that the site does not incur any damage.', 'Given the vast geographic distribution and largely non-coastal nature of our sites, the tool showed that less than 1% of our portfolio is considered at-risk of coastal flooding currently.', 'Though there were minimal increases in coastal flooding risk in both forward-looking scenarios, communications sites at-risk remained at less than 1% of our portfolio, and therefore, the Company is considered resilient to coastal flood risk.', 'The results of the CR&O Assessment determined that the identified risks are fully mitigated—the risk is mitigated to a fully acceptable tolerance level and American Tower will continue executing and monitoring—or mostly mitigated—the risk is within tolerance, but not fully acceptable and requires some additional mitigation or enhancement to existing mitigation.', 'No risks fell in the partially mitigated or unmitigated categories, as none were outside the Company’s risk tolerance level or required significant and/or immediate action beyond what was currently or in the process of being implemented.', 'Opportunities are categorized based on level of investment; all were listed as properly invested, indicating the proper amount of financial capital and resources are dedicated to the initiative at this time and in the forward-looking scenarios, if the investment strategy is properly maintained or adjusted as needed.', 'The overall analysis related to the above climate-related risks indicates the Company is largely resilient and that the risks are mitigated well in both scenarios.', 'In addition, the Company is making adequate investment in renewable energy solutions and energy efficiency improvements.', 'Notably, since 2012, we have invested over $400 million in energy solutions, including renewable generation, on-site storage and efficiency improvements, which greatly reduce our environmental impact, as well as our tenants’ potential exposure to emerging carbon regulation.', 'AMERICAN TOWER | 2021 SUSTAINABILITY

outlined above were included in the scenario analysis, where they were assessed for likelihood and potential impact to our business under two different climate scenarios.', 'For the analysis, we selected two scenarios—business-as-usual and aggressive mitigation.', 'These two scenarios were based on the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s (IPCC) Sixth Assessment Report – Shared Socio-economic Pathways (SSPs).', 'The two models used were the best-case scenario (SSP1-2.6), where the global average temperature increases by less than 2°C, and a business-as-usual scenario (SSP5-8.5), where the average global temperature increases by more than 4°C by the end of the century.', 'As part of the analysis process, we conducted multiple workshops across our five regions—Africa, APAC, Europe, Latin America, and U.S. and Canada—to develop an understanding of how the top risks and opportunities may result in potential impacts under the two scenarios selected.', 'Where possible, we translated the top climate risks and opportunities into potential financial impact, using a series of facts and assumptions based on Company data and scientific literature.', 'For example, we investigated the potential impact of natural disasters (e.g., hurricanes, ice, windstorms, tornadoes, floods and wildfires) on our infrastructure assets.', 'Over the past five years, the resulting damage from extreme weather events is estimated at approximately $3 million per annum globally, reduced further to less than $1 million per annum after insurance payouts, and on average fewer than 30 of more than 220,000 communications sites across our portfolio are significantly affected annually.', 'When measured against our company-wide total net property and equipment of close to $20 billion, this represents less than a tenth of one percent of our total tower, equipment and other related property value.', 'During the scenario analysis, we utilized publicly available government-authored geographic information system data layers to better understand how the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events may change in the future.', 'The results of our scenario analysis show that extreme weather risk is expected to remain proportionally insignificant over the next 30 years.', 'Additionally, we assessed the risk of future sea level rise to our communications sites.', 'We collected the geographic coordinates of all sites and, using a proprietary tool from an independent organization of leading scientists, mapped our site locations against a model that combines sea level rise, land elevation and storm predictions to estimate future coastal flood threat.', 'The model is aligned with the IPCC scenarios and, as such, we were able to estimate potential exposure through 2050 under our two scenarios.', 'We considered a site at-risk if the model estimated the site would flood at least once every five years.', 'The proprietary tool is unable to discern between negligible and more significant flood events, so while a site may be considered at risk for floods, it is probable based on Company experience to date, that the site does not incur any damage.', 'Given the vast geographic distribution and largely non-coastal nature of our sites, the tool showed that less than 1% of our portfolio is considered at-risk of coastal flooding currently.', 'Though there were minimal increases in coastal flooding risk in both forward-looking scenarios, communications sites at-risk remained at less than 1% of our portfolio, and therefore, the Company is considered resilient to coastal flood risk.', 'The results of the CR&O Assessment determined that the identified risks are fully mitigated—the risk is mitigated to a fully acceptable tolerance level and American Tower will continue executing and monitoring—or mostly mitigated—the risk is within tolerance, but not fully acceptable and requires some additional mitigation or enhancement to existing mitigation.', 'No risks fell in the partially mitigated or unmitigated categories, as none were outside the Company’s risk tolerance level or required significant and/or immediate action beyond what was currently or in the process of being implemented.', 'Opportunities are categorized based on level of investment; all were listed as properly invested, indicating the proper amount of financial capital and resources are dedicated to the initiative at this time and in the forward-looking scenarios, if the investment strategy is properly maintained or adjusted as needed.', 'The overall analysis related to the above climate-related risks indicates the Company is largely resilient and that the risks are mitigated well in both scenarios.', 'In addition, the Company is making adequate investment in renewable energy solutions and energy efficiency improvements.', 'Notably, since 2012, we have invested over $400 million in energy solutions, including renewable generation, on-site storage and efficiency improvements, which greatly reduce our environmental impact, as well as our tenants’ potential exposure to emerging carbon regulation.', 'AMERICAN TOWER | 2021 SUSTAINABILITY

outlined above were included in the scenario analysis, where they were assessed for likelihood and potential impact to our business under two different climate scenarios.', 'For the analysis, we selected two scenarios—business-as-usual and aggressive mitigation.', 'These two scenarios were based on the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s (IPCC) Sixth Assessment Report – Shared Socio-economic Pathways (SSPs).', 'The two models used were the best-case scenario (SSP1-2.6), where the global average temperature increases by less than 2°C, and a business-as-usual scenario (SSP5-8.5), where the average global temperature increases by more than 4°C by the end of the century.', 'As part of the analysis process, we conducted multiple workshops across our five regions—Africa, APAC, Europe, Latin America, and U.S. and Canada—to develop an understanding of how the top risks and opportunities may result in potential impacts under the two scenarios selected.', 'Where possible, we translated the top climate risks and opportunities into potential financial impact, using a series of facts and assumptions based on Company data and scientific literature.', 'For example, we investigated the potential impact of natural disasters (e.g., hurricanes, ice, windstorms, tornadoes, floods and wildfires) on our infrastructure assets.', 'Over the past five years, the resulting damage from extreme weather events is estimated at approximately $3 million per annum globally, reduced further to less than $1 million per annum after insurance payouts, and on average fewer than 30 of more than 220,000 communications sites across our portfolio are significantly affected annually.', 'When measured against our company-wide total net property and equipment of close to $20 billion, this represents less than a tenth of one percent of our total tower, equipment and other related property value.', 'During the scenario analysis, we utilized publicly available government-authored geographic information system data layers to better understand how the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events may change in the future.', 'The results of our scenario analysis show that extreme weather risk is expected to remain proportionally insignificant over the next 30 years.', 'Additionally, we assessed the risk of future sea level rise to our communications sites.', 'We collected the geographic coordinates of all sites and, using a proprietary tool from an independent organization of leading scientists, mapped our site locations against a model that combines sea level rise, land elevation and storm predictions to estimate future coastal flood threat.', 'The model is aligned with the IPCC scenarios and, as such, we were able to estimate potential exposure through 2050 under our two scenarios.', 'We considered a site at-risk if the model estimated the site would flood at least once every five years.', 'The proprietary tool is unable to discern between negligible and more significant flood events, so while a site may be considered at risk for floods, it is probable based on Company experience to date, that the site does not incur any damage.', 'Given the vast geographic distribution and largely non-coastal nature of our sites, the tool showed that less than 1% of our portfolio is considered at-risk of coastal flooding currently.', 'Though there were minimal increases in coastal flooding risk in both forward-looking scenarios, communications sites at-risk remained at less than 1% of our portfolio, and therefore, the Company is considered resilient to coastal flood risk.', 'The results of the CR&O Assessment determined that the identified risks are fully mitigated—the risk is mitigated to a fully acceptable tolerance level and American Tower will continue executing and monitoring—or mostly mitigated—the risk is within tolerance, but not fully acceptable and requires some additional mitigation or enhancement to existing mitigation.', 'No risks fell in the partially mitigated or unmitigated categories, as none were outside the Company’s risk tolerance level or required significant and/or immediate action beyond what was currently or in the process of being implemented.', 'Opportunities are categorized based on level of investment; all were listed as properly invested, indicating the proper amount of financial capital and resources are dedicated to the initiative at this time and in the forward-looking scenarios, if the investment strategy is properly maintained or adjusted as needed.', 'The overall analysis related to the above climate-related risks indicates the Company is largely resilient and that the risks are mitigated well in both scenarios.', 'In addition, the Company is making adequate investment in renewable energy solutions and energy efficiency improvements.', 'Notably, since 2012, we have invested over $400 million in energy solutions, including renewable generation, on-site storage and efficiency improvements, which greatly reduce our environmental impact, as well as our tenants’ potential exposure to emerging carbon regulation.', 'AMERICAN TOWER | 2021 SUSTAINABILITY
