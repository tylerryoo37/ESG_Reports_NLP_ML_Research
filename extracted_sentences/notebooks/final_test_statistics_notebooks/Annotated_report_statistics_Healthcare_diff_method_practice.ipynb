      "We are also collaborating with Johnson & Johnson to scale up production of its pandemic vaccine to help expand global access.\n",

      "I am especially proud of our long-standing commitment to helping solve the world’s most vexing health challenges.\n",

      "In 2020, our products and pipeline targeted 88 percent of the top 20 global burdens of disease.\n",

care capacity and address barriers to access supported by our company’s Foundation was allocated to impact evaluation.', 'Vaccines Key accomplishments and milestones The total number of doses of our vaccines that have been distributed has increased significantly since 2010 and our global reach has also increased dramatically: in 2020 approximately 74 percent of our vaccines were distributed outside the U.S., up from 28 percent in 2010.', 'More than 70 million doses of two of our vaccines—GARDASIL® [Human Papillomavirus Quadrivalent (Types 6, 11, 16, and 18) Vaccine, Recombinant] and ROTATEQ® (Rotavirus Vaccine, Live, Oral, Pentavalent)—have been distributed in Gavi-eligible countries through 2019.', 'This represents important progress toward ensuring that these vaccines reach people in low-income settings with a high burden of disease.', 'We made progress in our efforts to help address Ebola virus disease.', 'In December 2019, ERVEBO® (Ebola Zaire Vaccine, Live), our vaccine to help prevent this disease, was approved by the U.S. FDA and also approved', 'Merck ESG Progress Report 2020/2021', 'in the Democratic Republic of Congo.', 'As of April 2021, the vaccine has been approved in nine African countries.', 'These approvals mark a historic moment for global public health and represent an unprecedented effort by a diverse set of partners from around the world.',

response efforts, in close collaboration with the WHO.', 'In the past three years, we have donated more than 300,000 doses of the investigational V920 to response efforts.', 'Access pricing Our company works with governments, international health and development organizations, donor groups, NGOs and others to support countries’ population health aims and help improve sustainable vaccination programs.', 'We use tiered pricing for vaccines as an equitable way to achieve dual objectives: to expand access for people who can benefit from vaccination; and to ensure sufficient return on investment over time to support the complex and costly research, development and manufacturing capacity necessary to create and supply new vaccines and address post-licensure regulatory requirements.', 'We consider a variety of factors in arriving at a price in a given country, including the local burden of disease, the health economic value of the vaccine, the country’s ability to support vaccine delivery and achieve population health coverage, its level of economic development, its fiscal capacity for investments in health and actual health spending, as well as its mechanism and policies for procuring vaccines.', 'In addition, we work with governments to address affordability challenges and increase system efficiencies to support the sustainability of immunization programs.', 'Overview', 'GRI/SASB:', 'General disclosures Economic Environmental Social Indices', '59', ' We also consider inequities in access within a country.', 'Where regulations and infrastructure allow, reduced pricing has been offered to support government- or donor-funded coverage of lower-economictier segments.', 'Our commitment to helping protect global health by improving the affordability, availability, accessibility and use of our vaccines around the world is fundamental to our business and overall mission.', 'We offer GARDASIL, which helps to protect against HPV-related diseases, at an access price that is significantly less than the value-based price in other countries.', 'The access price is exclusive to the public sectors of the countries eligible for support from Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance.', 'In 2015, we extended our current Gavi prices for GARDASIL through 2025 to Gavi-graduated countries with a per-capita gross national income (GNI) not exceeding $3,200.', 'This action greatly assists Gavi-transitioned countries by facilitating access to these vaccines in those countries, while also making sure they remain affordable and sustainable in the long term.', 'In the short period of time since we made our price commitment to countries transitioning out of Gavi support, numerous countries have taken advantage of the offer to introduce or continue existing national HPV vaccination programs.', 'We also remain actively engaged with Gavi on policy efforts to improve access to vaccines in Gavi-transitioned countries.', 'We believe that our pricing approach contributes to broader access to our vaccines while taking into account our need to continue investing in vaccine research, development and production.', 'Manufacturing and supply In the last few years, countries around the world have enacted new or expanded vaccination programs.', 'This has contributed to an unprecedented increase in global demand for vaccines.', 'We are committed to increasing our capacity and supply capability.', 'Our commitment to invest in capital projects over five years has increased to $20 billion, with a significant portion dedicated to vaccines.', 'In fact, in 2019, we supplied our highest ever quantity of vaccines globally.', 'Maintaining product quality is paramount.', 'To provide high-quality vaccines to people who need them, we manage our supply chain through policies and procedures designed to keep the distribution system secure.', 'We continue to explore potential strategic partnerships with other manufacturers to increase supply and promote greater access in local markets.', 'COVID-19 manufacturing agreements In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we have entered into multiple agreements to support efforts to expand the

responded to the unique challenges of a global pandemic without compromising our sustainability commitment.', 'We contributed directly to the worldwide fight against COVID-19, and our associates demonstrated tremendous dedication as they turned challenges into impactful opportunities to help our customers and the global community.', 'In recent years, the increased urgency for bold leadership around diversity and inclusion (D+I) and climate change has inspired us to aim even higher with our sustainability goals.', 'As with all our endeavors at Danaher, the spirit of continuous improvement that’s at the heart of the Danaher Business System (DBS) has motivated our pursuits and helped us positively impact the world around us in meaningful ways.', 'At Danaher, we view sustainability as a fundamental responsibility and an increasingly important strategic priority that touches every aspect of our business.', 'To us, sustainability is a commitment to Helping Realize Life’s Potential for generations of stakeholders— considering the long-term interests of our associates, customers, shareholders, business partners, communities and planet in everything we do.', 'With DBS as our driving force, we have made measurable progress across our three sustainability pillars: the Innovation that fuels world-shaping advances across an array of scientific disciplines; the People at the heart of our teams, along with their families and communities; and the Environment that sustains us.', 'GRI: 102-14, UN: SDG-13', 'Innovation Innovation Defines Our Future, one of our five Core Values,

help customers develop and produce new vaccines and therapeutics in record time, and rapidly expand production capacity to meet increased demand.', 'At the same time, we continued to invest for the future across our businesses, focusing our innovation efforts on new technologies and solutions in anticipation of the challenges our customers will encounter.', 'Across Life Sciences, our innovative offering is helping drive a revolution in biology that holds the promise of making more life-saving treatments available to more patients by applying scientific and technological breakthroughs at scale.', 'Our Diagnostics businesses are unified around making a difference in acute care, empowering clinicians with the tools they need for faster, more accurate diagnoses to drive better patient outcomes.', 'And in Environmental & Applied Solutions, our businesses are focused on protecting the world’s most precious resources.', 'At Danaher, our world-shaping innovations are the product of a rigorous model and toolset we call the DBS Innovation Engine, a clear methodology to develop, protect and measure the impact of our growing body of intellectual property.', 'Our strength in replicable processes helps us ensure a systematic approach to ongoing innovation at Danaher while fostering the necessary flexibility for creativity and disruptive ideas.', 'We are also investing in cultivating

The Best Team Wins.', 'We believe that the best team is a diverse and engaged one, where each team member is inspired to do their best work and feels a powerful sense of belonging.', 'Though our D+I journey is by no means new, its importance continues to grow.', 'In last year’s Sustainability Report we included quantitative targets for our diversity representation, and based on our continued progress we are increasing our 2025 goal for U.S. People of Color to 38% from 35%.', 'This year’s Report reflects even greater transparency in our diversity metrics and our commitment to human rights.', 'You will see our new policy statement on human rights as well as new D+I metrics and data that we are publicly disclosing for the first time, with a particular focus on diversity representation and pay equity.', 'We are also taking a closer look at how engagement and promoting leaders from within can help us build and strengthen our winning team.', 'We have made progress, especially at the leadership level, but the diversity of our overall associate population has not yet met our aspirations.', 'To achieve this, we are pursuing a D+I breakthrough across the entire Company.', 'At Danaher, when we reach for bold objectives that we care deeply about, we turn to Policy Deployment (PD), a DBS tool that helps our operating companies determine their critical few Improvement Priorities and create new, sustainable processes to execute their strategic action plans.', 'I’m pleased to announce that beginning in 2021, all Danaher operating companies have added D+I

requirements around mitigating our environmental impact—including our commitment to leverage DBS to support our environmental program and goals.', 'Every day across Danaher, we strive to positively

create a better world is limitless.', 'Our deep commitment to continuous improvement compels us to take meaningful actions that benefit the greater good and to fulfill our obligations as global stewards of the environment.', 'As we seek to make measurable progress on this front, we are fortunate to have DBS as our driving force.', 'In 2020, we announced our goals to reduce our energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions, and the percentage of nonhazardous/non-regulated waste sent to landfill or incineration—each by 15% by the year 2024.', 'To help operationalize these improvements across our businesses, we have broadened the application of our DBS energy management and waste reduction toolkits.', 'We believe that setting explicit goals provides the transparency and

operating companies have incorporated customer feedback and innovated products and solutions to address sustainability-specific needs.', 'In addition, Danaher’s businesses are increasingly focused on improving efficiency across our production and distribution processes, production assets, buildings and transport/mobility in relation to energy reduction, efficiency, waste and water management.',

world class team that is fully integrated with all parts of R&D.', 'We are assembling vast datasets into a data lab, and, in-house or with partners, developing advanced analytical methods including AI and machine learning, to analyze these data to solve problems that make our R&D teams more effective and efficient, and often enable earlier delivery of new possibilities.', 'We are increasingly leveraging data science and digital health to accelerate innovation at every step of the R&D process to generate insights that allow us to better understand the diseases we are tackling.', 'For example, data science helps us determine which compounds show the most promise, bring the best molecules into clinical development and design, and execute clinical trials more effectively for exactly the right patients.', 'One major impact of using data science-driven algorithms can be the earlier detection of disease in patients and determination of the most suitable medicines, especially for those with progressive diseases.', 'Today, we have more than 100 data science and digital health projects, powering more than 90% of our development pipeline.', 'Examples of our progress in data science and digital health in 2021 included: Generating unprecedented data to address multiple diseases: In January 2021, we became a Founding Industry Member of the Our Future Health consortium, which aims to collect one of the most comprehensive and most diverse datasets ever from 5 million volunteers in the UK.', 'Johnson & Johnson and other pharma peers will be able to analyze this dataset

200,000 UK Biobank participants (of a total 500,000) was made available to researchers to enable them to better understand the role of genetics for health outcomes and potentially advance drug discovery and development.', 'The dataset will allow researchers globally to study the 98% of genetic code that is not protein-coded and previously had no known purpose.', 'Enhancing clinical trials: Data science is also enhancing the speed, efficiency and inclusiveness of our clinical trials.', 'In the early stages of the COVID-19', 'pandemic, for example, we were able to gather comprehensive datasets and leverage advanced analytics to understand how COVID-19 was spreading worldwide, where it would likely peak next and where the potential for viral mutations would be highest.', 'These predictions proved remarkably accurate and enabled us to place clinical trial sites in “hot spots” where participants would be more likely to have exposure to COVID-19—meaning we could more quickly determine the efficacy of vaccines.', 'This helped reduce the vaccine development timeline while generating efficacy data across multiple COVID-19 variants of interest.', 'This effort, undertaken with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, was recognized with the 2021 Innovative Applications in Analytics Award from the Institute for Operations Research and the Management Sciences (INFORMS), regarding the creative and unique application of analytical techniques.', 'Finding early markers of disease: Speed is critical when it comes to identifying patients and providing the proper treatment, yet for many, rare and difficult-todetect diseases, diagnosis often comes late—or never at all.', 'For example, for patients with PAH, the average time from onset of symptoms to diagnosis is two years, causing delay in treatment and a lower average five-year survival rate.', 'Using the results of echocardiograms, we are applying AI, together with external collaborators, to help identify early markers of PAH to help change the lives of those living with the disease.', 'Enabling more targeted therapies: The use of data science helps us select the optimum therapy for individual patients.', 'For example, we are using AI to analyze histopathology images from patients with bladder cancer to detect mutations that may make patients more likely to respond to new medicines and facilitate recruitment into clinical trials for potentially lifesaving therapies.', 'We are also leveraging data science to help identify the most appropriate people for our Phase 3 trial for a vaccine to prevent certain E. coli infections, that are becoming increasingly resistant to commonly used antibiotics.', 'We applied machine learning to real-world data (RWD) to better understand the patient

business, it’s clear that Abbott is a company that endures.', 'That’s because we’ve long understood that the key to sustaining our enterprise is a willingness to evolve it, to anticipate changes in the environment and to adapt Abbott in ways that make us best able to achieve our fundamental purpose — helping people live healthier, fuller lives.', 'We’ve amply demonstrated that ability throughout our history, strategically reshaping Abbott to become one of the world’s leading health technology companies, with a broad portfolio and global reach that let us help more people than ever before.', 'The past few years have been among the most challenging in our lifetimes, but they’ve also highlighted for us the critical nature of the work we do and the significant positive impact we can have for patients and for the communities in which we operate.', 'But we know that if we want to sustain that impact in a changing world, we can’t rely on the same playbooks we’ve used before.', 'So, incorporating input from internal and', 'external stakeholders, we developed a 10-year plan to identify the areas we need to focus on in order to grow sustainably.', 'Central to this plan is the idea that we can do the most good by pursuing our fundamental mission as a company: bringing life-changing technologies and products to the people and places that need them.', 'That’s why we’re building affordability into our products to increase access to them, and breaking down barriers that prevent people from getting the care they need.', 'And to support that core purpose, we’ve set ourselves ambitious goals in key areas that strengthen our foundation for the future, including building the workforce of tomorrow, responsibly applying data to advance care, building a more resilient, diverse and responsible supply chain, and protecting health by safeguarding the environment.', 'This report is the first to detail the progress we’ve made on these 2030 goals and, as you’ll read, we’re making real strides in all of these areas.', 'We’re setting the foundation for our long-term success, but we’re also remaining responsive to the pressing issues of today.', 'For example, our contributions to the fight against COVID-19 remained important and impactful (see page 6).', 'We also stepped up in a variety of ways in response to the crisis in Ukraine, donating $6 million in funding and much-needed products to rebuild critical healthcare infrastructure and deliver emergency and primary healthcare services and supplies, working with humanitarian organizations including International Medical Corps, Americares, CARE and Project HOPE.', 'The values that drove those actions were also in evidence in our decision, in 2022, to recall infant formula produced at one of our U.S. plants (see page 60).', 'Our people are committed to our Customer Pledge to make our products as if they’re for our own families; and we’ll be redoubling our efforts – across every business, across every part of the globe – to ensure that our long-established reputation for excellence and the highest product quality will remain our bedrock.', 'At Abbott, we’re in the business of making people’s lives better, and we manage all aspects of the company to ensure we’ll be doing that for decades to come.', 'Our fundamental goal is simple: we are working for a world with fewer barriers — one that enables people to live their fullest possible lives — creating healthier people, healthier communities and a healthier world.', 'Sincerely,', 'Robert B.
