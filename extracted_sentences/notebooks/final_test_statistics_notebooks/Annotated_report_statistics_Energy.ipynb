'To all our Stakeholders', 'n 2021, Total became TotalEnergies: A new name for a new ambition to become a major player in the energy transition, engaged towards getting to net zero by 2050, together with society.', 'This choice stems from a deeply-held conviction that everyone on the planet has the right to have access to energy – reliable, affordable energy that is a source of economic and social development.', 'At the same time, people expect a clear and responsible commitment from businesses to preserve the climate for future generations.', 'The energy transition is under way.', 'Our Company is transforming to provide tangible, sustainable solutions to the dual challenge of more energies, less emissions.', 'Two objectives: reporting on our progress and expanding on our ambition In 2021, our shareholders broadly supported this ambition through their vote at the Annual Shareholders’ Meeting.', 'One year later, we are publishing this Sustainability & Climate – 2022 Progress Report to show how our ambition is reflected in the deployment of our strategy and in our investment decisions, as well as to share our 2021 achievements, which demonstrate and stake out the path of our transformation for meeting our 2030 objectives and our ambition of getting to net zero by 2050, together with society.', 'This report also provides an opportunity for us to explain even more clearly and transparently our climate ambition, our progress, the pertinence of our 2030 objectives and our ability to meet or exceed them, and in so doing, show our stakeholders that we are already on the right track.', 'As we promised, each year the TotalEnergies Board of Directors reviews the relevance of its ambitions, as well as the appropriateness of its strategy and targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions in the light of progress in international and national policies, new scenarios concerning decarbonization trajectories, advances in low carbon technologies, action taken by other sectors, including its customers, and other changes in society in terms of energy transition and sustainable development.', '0 4-0 5', 'That is why, through this report, we are expanding on the ambition we submitted to our shareholders in 2021.', 'For the first time, we describe our 2050 vision of a net zero TotalEnergies, together with society.', 'Renewable electricity will account for half of its production; new decarbonized molecules from biomass (biofuels and biogas) or from renewable electricity (hydrogen and e-fuels) will represent a quarter; and hydrocarbons (oil and gas) the remaining quarter, with their residual emissions fully captured, recycled or offset.', 'This vision is not a mirage or greenwashing.', 'It is based on measurable objectives to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions in the short (2025), medium (2030) and long (2050) term, covering our industrial operations (Scope 1+2) and the emissions generated by our customers’ use of our energy products (Scope 3).', 'We affirm our ambitious target of a more than 30% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions related to sales of petroleum products (Scope 3 Oil) by 2030 compared to 2015.', 'To that, we add phased targets for reducing methane emissions (50% from 2020 levels by 2025 and 80% from 2020 levels by 2030) to move towards zero methane and an objective of less than 0.1 million cubic meters per day for routine gas flaring at our operated assets by 2025, before eliminating flaring completely by 2030.', 'Objectives aligned with society’s net zero ambition According to assessments by respected independent third parties, our target of a 40% reduction by 2030 in our net Scope 1+2 emissions compared to 2015 is in line with the commitments made by countries with a net zero pledge, including the European Union with its \"Fit for 55\" package.', 'I am also pleased that Transition Pathway Initiative (TPI) announced that TotalEnergies is one of three oil and gas firms that “have set emissions reduction targets that are ambitious enough to reach net zero by 2050 and to align with TPI’s 1.5°C benchmark.” This report also includes our analysis of the International Energy Agency’s normative Net Zero Emissions scenario, which some observers are now using as guidance.', 'Even though we do not think that our societies can match the scenario’s trend in the short term, we do share the 2050 end-point described by the IEA for carbon neutrality.', 'For this reason, we have decided to take the scenario into account, for testing the resilience of our portfolio and projects and ensuring the strength of our balance sheet.', 'Our contribution to the development of renewable energies, as called for in the Net Zero Emissions scenario, accelerated in 2021.', 'Our investments in renewables and electricity accounted for 25% of total investments, which is more than the 20% we forecast one year ago.', 'Combined with our investments in new molecules, this means that soon more than 30% of our investments will be devoted to decarbonized energy.', 'In the interests of full disclosure, we are including the taxonomy of our operations for the first time, ahead of the new European regulations.', 'Our ambition is backed by a clear and disciplined investment strategy, with the objective of channeling half of our future investments to growing renewable energies, gas and new decarbonized molecules.', 'The other half will be used to maintain our traditional production base.', 'In this way, we will be able to gradually build up an integrated portfolio of multi-energy assets that all share two crucial criteria for ensuring a commodity-producing company’s sustainable profitability in a period of energy transition: low production costs and low CO2 emissions.', 'The results obtained in 2021 back up our ambition.', 'We installed 10 GW of renewable electricity capacity, increased our LNG sales to 42 Mt (99% of which sold to net zero countries), reduced the share of our sales from petroleum products to 44% of the total from 65% in 2015, lowered emissions from our operated facilities (Scope 1+2) by 20% from 2015 and reduced the carbon footprint of our products sold in Europe by 14% compared to 2015.', 'All of these results allow us to deliver energy to our customers that has a more than 10% lower lifecycle carbon intensity than in 2015.', 'In this report, you will also find, for the first time, an assessment of the Scope 1+2 emissions of our non-operated assets and our emissions on an', 'equity share basis, as well as the geographic spread of our Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions by region.', 'In carrying out our transformation and advancing on the path to net zero, we are not alone.', 'We are working to engage customers, suppliers, researchers, start-ups and others.', 'In 2021, we multiplied our low-carbon collaborations and partnerships and we intend to drive further progress with all the players in our value chain, especially in new mobilities.', 'Working for a just transition, together with our stakeholders Since our climate ambition is intrinsically linked to our sustainable development ambition, you will also find a discussion of our efforts to have a positive impact, initiated with our stakeholders, based on dialogue and transparency.', 'We affirm our commitment to offering our employees around the world a safe, inclusive and stimulating work environment where they can make the most of future-oriented skills.', 'I would like to salute their engagement: we have them to thank for allowing us to achieve the best accident rate in our sector in 2021.', 'We developed this new ambition together – in the midst of the Covid-19 pandemic –and we are deploying it together within the framework of a just transition.', 'Respect for Each Other, and therefore for human rights, is a cornerstone of our Code of Conduct.', 'In this report, we give tangible examples to describe how we ensure respect for human rights in all our operations and how we work with communities to create value in our host territories.', 'Care for the environment is also a key focus of our sustainable development approach.', 'This report details our environmental requirements and our new objectives for biodiversity, for managing scarce water resources and for the circular economy.', 'As I write this, two realities are unfolding.', 'On the one hand, Russia’s armed aggression against Ukraine threatens people, European stability and the energy market’s equilibrium.', 'On the other, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s new report powerfully reminds us of the climate emergency.', 'In this environment, explaining our ambition and showing how it is being put in place takes on its full meaning.', 'Guided by our values and backed by our talents, I am confident in our ability to keep moving forward, to resolutely drive the transformation of our industrial model and to help, with our stakeholders, shape the just transition to which our societies aspire.', 'Patrick Pouyanné Sustainability & Climate 2022 Progress Report', ' MESSAGE FROM MARIE-CHRISTINE COISNE-ROQUETTE, Lead Independent Director and Chairwoman of the

IEA’s Net Zero Emissions (NZE) Scenario is a “normative” scenario that describes a changing world energy demand that would be consistent with limiting the global temperature rise to 1.5°C “without overshooting the related carbon budget”.', 'The NZE Scenario’s vision for 2050 features the following: • Electrification of final demand would rise to 49% from 20% today, with 88% decarbonized electricity versus 28% in 2020.', 'The use of coal would be virtually eliminated in 2050 and capacity for renewables would rise eightfold (20 for solar and wind, 2.7 for hydroelectricity).', '• Demand for oil would stand at 24 Mb/day, down 75% from 2019.', 'The 2030 crossing point corresponds roughly to linearization of the decline between now and 2050, i.e., a 25 Mb/day decrease every ten years (very sharp immediate fall with no further acceleration).', '• Demand for natural gas would stand at 29 Mboe/day, down 57% from 2019.', 'In 2050, green gas (decarbonized hydrogen, ammonia and biogas) would account for 10% of the global energy mix versus 6% for natural gas.', '• Net zero would be achieved thanks to 7.6 Gt of CO2 storage per year by 2050.', 'This “normative” scenario requires a drastic change in energy demand between 2020 and 2030: • In the NZE Scenario, demand would drop by around 0.7% a year between 2020 and 2030 (even though the global population and GDP continue to rise) in order to immediately bend the trajectory of global CO2 emissions.', '• That would involve a massive, concerted effort with regard to energy efficiency, which would improve by a spectacular 4.2% a year between 2020 and 2030; this compares to 1.5% a year on average over the last 20 years.', '• Demand for oil would decline by 26% over the decade to 72 Mb/day.', '• Demand for natural gas would level out between 2019 and 2025 and then decline to 62 Mboe/day in 2030 versus 68 Mboe/day in 2019 (down 0.9% per year).', '0 8-0 9', 'As this is a “normative” scenario, the IEA does not present it as a forecast of changes in energy demand, but rather as a blueprint that would need to be followed to achieve the 2050 objective.', 'The IEA specifies that the NZE Scenario is shaped by numerous “uncertainties”, including the speed with which demand and behaviors adapt, the real level of energy efficiency, the pace at which new decarbonization technologies such as hydrogen and CCS scale up, etc.', 'While we share the “normative” scenario’s vision for the energy mix in 2050, the trajectory mapped out for demand between 2020 and 2030 is undeniably at odds with current trends.', 'This applies to demand for energy overall, and to demand for oil, gas and coal.', 'The IEA’s own short- and long-term forecasts, published since May 2021, do not in any way support the assumptions of the NZE scenario.', 'Demand for coal in 2021 exceeded 2019 levels, and the IEA expects an increase of 0.5% a year between now and 2024.', 'According to its latest forecasts, demand for oil should be higher in 2022 than in 2019.', 'And worldwide gas demand increased by 4% in 2021, with the IEA expecting a 2% rise in 2022.', 'The NZE Scenario requires more than 1000 GW of new solar and wind capacity to be deployed each year between 2020 and 2030, which is four times as much as the 250 GW added in 2020.', 'This only makes a collective effort to change the global energy mix, still over 80% fossil-based, even more urgent and essential.', 'The highly demanding assumptions used for the trend in energy demand up to 2030 have led the IEA to affirm that the world no longer needs any new oil and gas projects because the natural field depletion of around 4% a year is in line with the modeled decline in oil consumption.', 'Conversely, an excessively sharp decline in oil and gas supply in an environment where demand is not adjusted accordingly would, of course, lead to higher prices.', 'With this in mind, it should be noted that the current level of investment in upstream oil and gas is below the level modeled by the IEA in the NZE Scenario for 2022-2030 ($320 billion and $350 billion in 2020 and 2021 versus $366 billion a year in the NZE Scenario).', '1', 'Transforming to Reinvent Energy In affirming its ambition to be a world-class player in the energy transition and to get to net zero by 2050, together with society, TotalEnergies has committed to profoundly transforming its production and sales while continuing to meet the energy needs of a growing population.', 'The Company is developing a wide range of energies in an integrated approach (from production to distribution to the end user) in order to decarbonize its energy offering and generate a competitive advantage that will create long-term value for its shareholders and stakeholders and secure its future.', 'Sustainability & Climate 2022 Progress Report', ' On one hand, the energy transition depends on the development of new molecules (biofuels and biogas, clean hydrogen, and synthetic fuels combining hydrogen and carbon) that TotalEnergies has the core skills to produce.', 'It is expanding in these markets with a focus on circular resource management.', 'On the other hand, the energy transition involves electrifying energy uses, which requires a massive increase in the supply of green electrons.', 'TotalEnergies is deploying across the entire renewable electricity value chain, from production and storage to trading and sales, in accordance with a selective, profitable approach.', 'Its goal is to rank among the top five global producers of solar- and wind-generated electricity by 2030.', 'Concerning gas, which is a transition fuel, TotalEnergies is pursuing its development across the liquefied natural gas (LNG) value chain to strengthen its position as the world’s thirdlargest LNG company.', 'LNG plays a key role in the net zero roadmaps of numerous coal-consuming countries and is the ideal partner to intermittent renewable energies.', 'As for oil, the Company is very selective and focuses its investments on low breakeven, low emissions projects.', 'As they evolve, energy markets are becoming increasingly interconnected and interdependent, particularly since electricity – the energy at the center of the transition – is a secondary energy, meaning that it depends on other energies and markets.', 'What’s more, electricity will be increasingly produced from intermittent sources that depend on weather factors that cannot be controlled.', 'Our integrated multi-energy strategy, combined with its solid financial base, are strengths and sources of resilience

our staff and contractors affected by the conflict and we are doing everything we can to help them.', 'Shell is helping in the relief effort and working with governments to find ways to secure energy supplies for Europe and other markets.', 'We also took decisive actions in support of global economic measures against Russia and you can read about them in the media release.', 'As the world faces these new challenges, and even as the COVID-19 pandemic continues, it must not lose sight of the importance of taking action on climate change.', 'Our Powering Progress strategy, which we launched in 2021, sets out how Shell can play a leading role in helping the world to reduce its carbon emissions.', 'At the heart of our strategy lies our own target to become a net-zero emissions energy business

PERFORMANCE DATA', 'ACCELERATING TOWARDS NET ZERO In 2021, we took an important step towards becoming a net-zero emissions business with a new target to reduce our absolute emissions from our operations (Scope 1 and Scope 2) by 50% by 2030, compared with 2016 levels on a net basis.', 'By the end of 2021, Shell had reduced Scope 1 and 2 emissions from our operations, and from the energy we buy to run our operations, by 18% from 83 million tonnes in 2016 to 68 million tonnes.', 'We also achieved our first short-term target of a 2-3% reduction in net carbon intensity (NCI) by the end of 2021.', 'Shell’s NCI in 2021 was 77 gCO2e/MJ which was a 2.5% reduction from the 2016 reference year.', 'We are also working with our customers and across sectors to help them find their own pathways to achieve net-zero emissions.', 'This will help grow demand for new low-carbon products.', 'But Powering Progress goes beyond achieving our net-zero targets.', 'In 2021, we started incorporating new ambitions within our business to respect the environment and to power people’s lives.', 'We also continued to support the UN Global Compact’s corporate governance principles on human rights, environmental protection, anti-corruption and better labour practices.', 'RESPECTING NATURE In this report, we have set out our commitments on biodiversity, water, and on helping to create a circular economy and reduce waste.', 'It is also of the utmost importance that we continue to work to prevent oil spills.', 'In 2021, we reduced the number of operational spills of more than 100 kilograms by 40%, compared with 2020.', 'However, in Nigeria, spills caused by oil theft and sabotage of pipelines continued amid heightened security risks.', 'We are dealing with these challenges and the impact they have on the environment, on local communities and on our business.', 'CONTRIBUTING TO COUNTRIES AND COMMUNITIES We are working with our suppliers to find ways to reduce greenhouse gas emissions across our supply chains.', 'In 2021, we rolled out a new digital platform which enables our suppliers to track performance on emissions reduction, share best practice and exchange emissions data with their own supply chains.', 'The supply of affordable, reliable and sustainable energy is crucial for raising living standards and for addressing other global challenges, including inequality.', 'In 2021, we continued to develop social investment programmes to improve access to energy in Ethiopia, Mozambique, Pakistan and South Africa.', 'In closing, I would like to thank the members of the independent Report Review Panel, who help us provide balanced and relevant reporting.', 'We have made the report more concise this year to make it easier for readers to understand our performance.', 'Each section guides you to our shell.com global website, where updates will keep you informed about our sustainability performance throughout the year.', 'This report sits with the Annual Report and the Energy Transition Report, which also provide information on our sustainability performance.', 'Sustainability is always a work in progress.', 'Shell has goals to lower our carbon emissions,

Shell.', 'During this process, Shell has considered our feedback in relation to the quality of sustainability reporting, particularly regarding content and presentation of information.', 'The panel notes that while the report is situated within the wider shell.com suite of information, the panel has not reviewed content on the website, nor is this part of its remit.', 'The panel notes that Shell has undertaken significant changes to its approach in the Sustainability Report that reflect a shift in how different stakeholders access information.', 'We welcome the clear movement towards the inclusion of more sustainabilityrelated data within the Annual Report as a signal that it is business-critical and strategic information.', 'We also note that the Sustainability Report has been designed to support stakeholders who wish to access sustainability data.', 'More qualitative content and relevant information material to the organisation, which was previously included in the report, now sits on the main website.', 'While understanding the evolution of reporting, we note the importance of ensuring that readers who wish to engage further on a topic are directed to the website to find up-to-date and relevant information.', 'We encourage Shell to think particularly about providing context to sections in which data are presented.', 'Such context would help readers interpret the quantitative information in the report.', 'In addition, we suggest paying special attention to the presentation of visual, tabular and graphic information.', 'These are all useful instruments to convey complex information as long as they are accessible to lay readers, for example by providing relevant comparative elements, benchmarks and signposts to significant data points.', 'There are areas of disclosure that we welcome particularly, including continued efforts on tax transparency, supplier conduct and compliance, as well as confirming where activities such as Arctic Circle activity will not take place, as well as where they could.', 'Language in some areas has become more precise and aligned to relevant international standards and external expectations.', 'For example, Shell now uses the term net carbon intensity in relation to measuring progress against net-zero emissions targets.', 'Looking ahead to the 2022 report, the panel would encourage Shell to: Provide clear context for data that are presented; Sufficiently explain how Shell plans to reach its targets; Depict progress against targets over time; Strengthen the human rights section with more explicit information about engaging with suppliers and other business partners, including joint-venture partners, to explain how human rights impacts throughout the value chain are being addressed in line with core international standards; Clearly explain what topics are material for Shell; Provide data assurance for sustainability topics beyond climate; Draw more connections between different ESG issues [including climate and human rights]; and Present more reflections on challenges that may have occurred during the year including steps it is taking to respond to litigation, advocacy campaigns or other incidents as appropriate and taking into account external stakeholders’ expectations.', '\\ue812 More in this report Sustainability at Shell | About our data | Our standards and policies | GRI

began reporting voluntarily on our environmental, safety and social performance with the first Shell Report in 1997.', 'We support transparency and share information and data in this report and on www.shell.com.', 'There are inherent limitations to the accuracy of environmental, safety and social performance data.', 'We recognise that our data will be affected by these limitations, so we continue to improve data integrity by strengthening our internal controls.', 'We provide all non-financial data in this report on a 100% basis for companies and joint ventures where we are the operator unless otherwise stated, in line with industry practice.', 'We believe that this boundary best reflects regulatory requirements, as well as internal policies, for the management of potential health, safety, environmental and social impacts.', 'We refer to the number of people employed or contracted on a full-time equivalent basis.', 'Operations acquired or divested during 2021 are included only for the period in which we operated these assets.', 'Other data are collected from external sources, employee surveys and other internal sources as indicated.', 'Some data in the social performance data table come from an internal survey completed by the senior Shell representative in each country.', 'The accuracy of environmental and social data may be lower than that of data obtained through our financial systems.', 'We only include data in this report for 2021 that were confirmed by the end of March 2022.', 'If incidents are reclassified or confirmed, or if significant data changes occur after preparation of this report, they will be updated in the following year’s publication.', 'ASSURANCE We have clear standards and reporting requirements for our health, safety, security, environment and social performance (HSSE & SP) data.', 'Shell companies are required to consider and adopt these standards, which define management roles and responsibilities, the scope of data at facilities and how data are calculated and collected.', 'These standards are part of our HSSE & SP Control Framework.', 'To ensure we provide accurate information, our assurance process for HSSE & SP data is also a key element of the HSSE & SP Control Framework.', 'Some examples of the assurance mechanisms in this process are: self-assessments at the facility level; internal audits at all levels of Shell; quarterly reviews and assessments of the data at all levels; an annual series of meetings between leaders at Group level and senior business managers to discuss outcomes and reporting parameters; and formal sign-off by Shell’s senior country leaders.', 'The Carbon Reporting Committee (CRC), which was formed in 2021, is tasked with ensuring that greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions measures, both absolute emissions and carbon intensity, and associated metrics, comply with all regulatory and legal requirements.', 'The Report Review Panel of independent experts helps ensure our reporting is balanced, relevant and responsive to stakeholders’ interests.', 'LRQA Limited has provided limited assurance of our net carbon intensity (measured and reported using the Net Carbon Footprint methodology), Scope 1 and Scope 2 greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions data under operational control for 2021 and Scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions from energy products included in our net carbon intensity.', 'Limited assurance means nothing has come to the auditor’s attention that would indicate that the greenhouse gas data and information as presented in the Greenhouse Gas Assertion were not materially correct.', 'The most recent assurance statements are available at www.shell.com/ ghg.', 'Conversions into US and Canadian dollars are based on the average exchange rates for

four other industrial companies in the Seine basin to launch development studies for carbon capture and maritime export infrastructure.', '• In Belgium, the Company and its partners are studying the CO2 Antwerp@C project to collect and transport CO2 emissions from the Antwerp industrial port.', 'In all three cases, the CO2 would be stored in depeleted reservoirs in the North Sea.', 'Developing transport and storage projects — • In Norway, the Company, together with Equinor and Shell, launched Northern Lights, the first large-scale carbon transport and storage project.', 'Approved by the Norwegian government in 2020, the project is currently in the construction phase.', 'It will allow industrial emitters in Norway and elsewhere in Europe to store their emissions.', '• In the Netherlands, TotalEnergies and its partners are studying the Aramis project designed to develop a logistics chain and hub in the port of Rotterdam to transport CO2 to depleted offshore fields, some of

light of Europe’s weight in its Scope 3 emissions in 2015 (256 Mt out of 410 Mt), the Company has set a specific target of reducing its Scope 1+2+3 emissions in Europe by 30% in absolute terms over the same period, as the reduction in sales of petroleum products will focus particularly on Europe.', 'Our objectives for 2030 TotalEnergies has set a target for 2030 of reducing its global Scope 3 emissions –\\u2009i.e., those from the energy products used by our customers\\u2009– to below 2015 levels, even though over the same period the Company plans to produce and sell 30% more energy products due, in particular, to growth in sales of elec- tricity and LNG.', 'Conversely, in order to prepare for the decline in demand for oil by the end of the decade, the Company has embarked on a voluntary strategy of adapting its Downstream activities in the refining and distribution of petroleum products to align them with its oil production, and it has set itself a new target of lowering

'To all our Stakeholders', 'n 2021, Total became TotalEnergies: A new name for a new ambition to become a major player in the energy transition, engaged towards getting to net zero by 2050, together with society.', 'This choice stems from a deeply-held conviction that everyone on the planet has the right to have access to energy – reliable, affordable energy that is a source of economic and social development.', 'At the same time, people expect a clear and responsible commitment from businesses to preserve the climate for future generations.', 'The energy transition is under way.', 'Our Company is transforming to provide tangible, sustainable solutions to the dual challenge of more energies, less emissions.', 'Two objectives: reporting on our progress and expanding on our ambition In 2021, our shareholders broadly supported this ambition through their vote at the Annual Shareholders’ Meeting.', 'One year later, we are publishing this Sustainability & Climate – 2022 Progress Report to show how our ambition is reflected in the deployment of our strategy and in our investment decisions, as well as to share our 2021 achievements, which demonstrate and stake out the path of our transformation for meeting our 2030 objectives and our ambition of getting to net zero by 2050, together with society.', 'This report also provides an opportunity for us to explain even more clearly and transparently our climate ambition, our progress, the pertinence of our 2030 objectives and our ability to meet or exceed them, and in so doing, show our stakeholders that we are already on the right track.', 'As we promised, each year the TotalEnergies Board of Directors reviews the relevance of its ambitions, as well as the appropriateness of its strategy and targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions in the light of progress in international and national policies, new scenarios concerning decarbonization trajectories, advances in low carbon technologies, action taken by other sectors, including its customers, and other changes in society in terms of energy transition and sustainable development.', '0 4-0 5', 'That is why, through this report, we are expanding on the ambition we submitted to our shareholders in 2021.', 'For the first time, we describe our 2050 vision of a net zero TotalEnergies, together with society.', 'Renewable electricity will account for half of its production; new decarbonized molecules from biomass (biofuels and biogas) or from renewable electricity (hydrogen and e-fuels) will represent a quarter; and hydrocarbons (oil and gas) the remaining quarter, with their residual emissions fully captured, recycled or offset.', 'This vision is not a mirage or greenwashing.', 'It is based on measurable objectives to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions in the short (2025), medium (2030) and long (2050) term, covering our industrial operations (Scope 1+2) and the emissions generated by our customers’ use of our energy products (Scope 3).', 'We affirm our ambitious target of a more than 30% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions related to sales of petroleum products (Scope 3 Oil) by 2030 compared to 2015.', 'To that, we add phased targets for reducing methane emissions (50% from 2020 levels by 2025 and 80% from 2020 levels by 2030) to move towards zero methane and an objective of less than 0.1 million cubic meters per day for routine gas flaring at our operated assets by 2025, before eliminating flaring completely by 2030.', 'Objectives aligned with society’s net zero ambition According to assessments by respected independent third parties, our target of a 40% reduction by 2030 in our net Scope 1+2 emissions compared to 2015 is in line with the commitments made by countries with a net zero pledge, including the European Union with its \"Fit for 55\" package.', 'I am also pleased that Transition Pathway Initiative (TPI) announced that TotalEnergies is one of three oil and gas firms that “have set emissions reduction targets that are ambitious enough to reach net zero by 2050 and to align with TPI’s 1.5°C benchmark.” This report also includes our analysis of the International Energy Agency’s normative Net Zero Emissions scenario, which some observers are now using as guidance.', 'Even though we do not think that our societies can match the scenario’s trend in the short term, we do share the 2050 end-point described by the IEA for carbon neutrality.', 'For this reason, we have decided to take the scenario into account, for testing the resilience of our portfolio and projects and ensuring the strength of our balance sheet.', 'Our contribution to the development of renewable energies, as called for in the Net Zero Emissions scenario, accelerated in 2021.', 'Our investments in renewables and electricity accounted for 25% of total investments, which is more than the 20% we forecast one year ago.', 'Combined with our investments in new molecules, this means that soon more than 30% of our investments will be devoted to decarbonized energy.', 'In the interests of full disclosure, we are including the taxonomy of our operations for the first time, ahead of the new European regulations.', 'Our ambition is backed by a clear and disciplined investment strategy, with the objective of channeling half of our future investments to growing renewable energies, gas and new decarbonized molecules.', 'The other half will be used to maintain our traditional production base.', 'In this way, we will be able to gradually build up an integrated portfolio of multi-energy assets that all share two crucial criteria for ensuring a commodity-producing company’s sustainable profitability in a period of energy transition: low production costs and low CO2 emissions.', 'The results obtained in 2021 back up our ambition.', 'We installed 10 GW of renewable electricity capacity, increased our LNG sales to 42 Mt (99% of which sold to net zero countries), reduced the share of our sales from petroleum products to 44% of the total from 65% in 2015, lowered emissions from our operated facilities (Scope 1+2) by 20% from 2015 and reduced the carbon footprint of our products sold in Europe by 14% compared to 2015.', 'All of these results allow us to deliver energy to our customers that has a more than 10% lower lifecycle carbon intensity than in 2015.', 'In this report, you will also find, for the first time, an assessment of the Scope 1+2 emissions of our non-operated assets and our emissions on an', 'equity share basis, as well as the geographic spread of our Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions by region.', 'In carrying out our transformation and advancing on the path to net zero, we are not alone.', 'We are working to engage customers, suppliers, researchers, start-ups and others.', 'In 2021, we multiplied our low-carbon collaborations and partnerships and we intend to drive further progress with all the players in our value chain, especially in new mobilities.', 'Working for a just transition, together with our stakeholders Since our climate ambition is intrinsically linked to our sustainable development ambition, you will also find a discussion of our efforts to have a positive impact, initiated with our stakeholders, based on dialogue and transparency.', 'We affirm our commitment to offering our employees around the world a safe, inclusive and stimulating work environment where they can make the most of future-oriented skills.', 'I would like to salute their engagement: we have them to thank for allowing us to achieve the best accident rate in our sector in 2021.', 'We developed this new ambition together – in the midst of the Covid-19 pandemic –and we are deploying it together within the framework of a just transition.', 'Respect for Each Other, and therefore for human rights, is a cornerstone of our Code of Conduct.', 'In this report, we give tangible examples to describe how we ensure respect for human rights in all our operations and how we work with communities to create value in our host territories.', 'Care for the environment is also a key focus of our sustainable development approach.', 'This report details our environmental requirements and our new objectives for biodiversity, for managing scarce water resources and for the circular economy.', 'As I write this, two realities are unfolding.', 'On the one hand, Russia’s armed aggression against Ukraine threatens people, European stability and the energy market’s equilibrium.', 'On the other, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s new report powerfully reminds us of the climate emergency.', 'In this environment, explaining our ambition and showing how it is being put in place takes on its full meaning.', 'Guided by our values and backed by our talents, I am confident in our ability to keep moving forward, to resolutely drive the transformation of our industrial model and to help, with our stakeholders, shape the just transition to which our societies aspire.', 'Patrick Pouyanné Sustainability & Climate 2022 Progress Report', ' MESSAGE FROM MARIE-CHRISTINE COISNE-ROQUETTE, Lead Independent Director and Chairwoman of the Governance and Ethics Committee', 'Governance: A Board of Directors on the Front Line', 'orporate stakeholders have increasingly high expectations concerning sustainable development.', 'For TotalEnergies, this is an opportunity more than a constraint, and that’s why we have put sustainability at the heart of our strategy.', 'I’m not just talking about climate, which is the main driver of our transformation, but also about people’s well-being, care for the environment and creating value for society.', 'Our business strategy, like our net zero ambition, is part of a transition dynamic that involves society as a whole.', 'We are delighted that businesses, governments, consumers and citizens have grasped the scale of the sustainability challenges.', 'TotalEnergies’ mission is to meet people’s growing need for energy, and its ambition is to produce increasingly low-carbon energies that remain affordable and reliable.', 'The Company is undergoing a profound transformation to get to net zero by 2050, together with society.', 'We are on the right track to meet our objectives for 2030, not only for renewable electricity (35 GW in 2025, 100 GW in 2030), but also more broadly for all our operations.', 'The entire Company is working to develop new energies and reduce the lifecycle carbon intensity of the products we provide to our customers.', 'The Company supports its employees by giving them the resources they need to make this transformation an opportunity for their own development.', '0 6 - 07', 'A board actively involved in the transformation The Board of Directors challenges and approves the strategy proposed by the Company’s management.', 'It plays a front-line role in supporting and accompanying the transformation.', 'The Board’s make-up illustrates TotalEnergies’ convictions concerning openness and diversity.', 'We have five different nationalities represented among our 14 Directors, six women and nine members who have specific competencies on climate/ sustainable development issues.', 'As Lead Independent Director, I meet with investor groups on a regular basis.', 'The debate over climate and energy sometimes inspires contradictory demands.', 'We need to listen carefully and understand those demands to determine the best balance in terms of needs and timing.', 'The sudden end to oil that some dream of would not be possible or

ambition and 2030 objectives for sustainable development and the energy transition toward net zero, together with society, and presented them to our shareholders so they could voice their opinion.', 'This ambition has received massive support from shareholders, with 92% favorable.', 'After talking to Christiana Figueres in 2020, the Board invited Fatih Birol, Executive Director of the International Energy Agency (IEA), in 2021, in order to get a better view of the underlying factors in the IEA’s Net Zero scenario.', 'In 2021, we added climate-target-related performance criteria to other sustainable development criteria (HSE, CSR, HR and diversity) in the determination of the Chairman and CEO’s variable compensation.', 'The Oil & Gas growth criterion in this calculation was replaced by two criteria concerning his steering of the transformation and profitable growth in renewables and electricity.', 'The granting of performance shares includes a criterion relating to the decline in indirect (Scope 3) emissions from the end use of energy products by TotalEnergies customers.', 'This multi-energy strategy requires a long-term view, and it will take time for TotalEnergies’ new strategic direction to produce its full effects.', 'During its annual strategic reviews, the Board will examine the appropriateness of this strategy and its targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions in the light of progress in international and national policies, new decarbonization scenarios, advances in low carbon technologies, action taken by other sectors – including our customers with our active support – and other changes in society concerning the energy transition.', 'This Sustainability & Climate 2022 Progress Report, which follows the TCFD1 recommendations,

IEA’s Net Zero Emissions (NZE) Scenario is a “normative” scenario that describes a changing world energy demand that would be consistent with limiting the global temperature rise to 1.5°C “without overshooting the related carbon budget”.', 'The NZE Scenario’s vision for 2050 features the following: • Electrification of final demand would rise to 49% from 20% today, with 88% decarbonized electricity versus 28% in 2020.', 'The use of coal would be virtually eliminated in 2050 and capacity for renewables would rise eightfold (20 for solar and wind, 2.7 for hydroelectricity).', '• Demand for oil would stand at 24 Mb/day, down 75% from 2019.', 'The 2030 crossing point corresponds roughly to linearization of the decline between now and 2050, i.e., a 25 Mb/day decrease every ten years (very sharp immediate fall with no further acceleration).', '• Demand for natural gas would stand at 29 Mboe/day, down 57% from 2019.', 'In 2050, green gas (decarbonized hydrogen, ammonia and biogas) would account for 10% of the global energy mix versus 6% for natural gas.', '• Net zero would be achieved thanks to 7.6 Gt of CO2 storage per year by 2050.', 'This “normative” scenario requires a drastic change in energy demand between 2020 and 2030: • In the NZE Scenario, demand would drop by around 0.7% a year between 2020 and 2030 (even though the global population and GDP continue to rise) in order to immediately bend the trajectory of global CO2 emissions.', '• That would involve a massive, concerted effort with regard to energy efficiency, which would improve by a spectacular 4.2% a year between 2020 and 2030; this compares to 1.5% a year on average over the last 20 years.', '• Demand for oil would decline by 26% over the decade to 72 Mb/day.', '• Demand for natural gas would level out between 2019 and 2025 and then decline to 62 Mboe/day in 2030 versus 68 Mboe/day in 2019 (down 0.9% per year).', '0 8-0 9', 'As this is a “normative” scenario, the IEA does not present it as a forecast of changes in energy demand, but rather as a blueprint that would need to be followed to achieve the 2050 objective.', 'The IEA specifies that the NZE Scenario is shaped by numerous “uncertainties”, including the speed with which demand and behaviors adapt, the real level of energy efficiency, the pace at which new decarbonization technologies such as hydrogen and CCS scale up, etc.', 'While we share the “normative” scenario’s vision for the energy mix in 2050, the trajectory mapped out for demand between 2020 and 2030 is undeniably at odds with current trends.', 'This applies to demand for energy overall, and to demand for oil, gas and coal.', 'The IEA’s own short- and long-term forecasts, published since May 2021, do not in any way support the assumptions of the NZE scenario.', 'Demand for coal in 2021 exceeded 2019 levels, and the IEA expects an increase of 0.5% a year between now and 2024.', 'According to its latest forecasts, demand for oil should be higher in 2022 than in 2019.', 'And worldwide gas demand increased by 4% in 2021, with the IEA expecting a 2% rise in 2022.', 'The NZE Scenario requires more than 1000 GW of new solar and wind capacity to be deployed each year between 2020 and 2030, which is four times as much as the 250 GW added in 2020.', 'This only makes a collective effort to change the global energy mix, still over 80% fossil-based, even more urgent and essential.', 'The highly demanding assumptions used for the trend in energy demand up to 2030 have led the IEA to affirm that the world no longer needs any new oil and gas projects because the natural field depletion of around 4% a year is in line with the modeled decline in oil consumption.', 'Conversely, an excessively sharp decline in oil and gas supply in an environment where demand is not adjusted accordingly would, of course, lead to higher prices.', 'With this in mind, it should be noted that the current level of investment in upstream oil and gas is below the level modeled by the IEA in the NZE Scenario for 2022-2030 ($320 billion and $350 billion in 2020 and 2021 versus $366 billion a year in the NZE Scenario).', '1', 'Transforming to Reinvent Energy In affirming its ambition to be a world-class player in the energy transition and to get to net zero by 2050, together with society, TotalEnergies has committed to profoundly transforming its production and sales while continuing to meet the energy needs of a growing population.', 'The Company is developing a wide range of energies in an integrated approach (from production to distribution to the end user) in order to decarbonize its energy offering and generate a competitive advantage that will create long-term value for its shareholders and stakeholders and secure its future.', 'Sustainability & Climate 2022 Progress Report', ' On one hand, the energy transition depends on the development of new molecules (biofuels and biogas, clean hydrogen, and synthetic fuels combining hydrogen and carbon) that TotalEnergies has the core skills to produce.', 'It is expanding in these markets with a focus on circular resource management.', 'On the other hand, the energy transition involves electrifying energy uses, which requires a massive increase in the supply of green electrons.', 'TotalEnergies is deploying across the entire renewable electricity value chain, from production and storage to trading and sales, in accordance with a selective, profitable approach.', 'Its goal is to rank among the top five global producers of solar- and wind-generated electricity by 2030.', 'Concerning gas, which is a transition fuel, TotalEnergies is pursuing its development across the liquefied natural gas (LNG) value chain to strengthen its position as the world’s thirdlargest LNG company.', 'LNG plays a key role in the net zero roadmaps of numerous coal-consuming countries and is the ideal partner to intermittent renewable energies.', 'As for oil, the Company is very selective and focuses its investments on low breakeven, low emissions projects.', 'As they evolve, energy markets are becoming increasingly interconnected and interdependent, particularly since electricity – the energy at the center of the transition – is a secondary energy, meaning that it depends on other energies and markets.', 'What’s more, electricity will be increasingly produced from intermittent sources that depend on weather factors that cannot be controlled.', 'Our integrated multi-energy strategy, combined with its solid financial base, are strengths and sources of resilience that will allow us to be a major provider of the sustainable energy the world needs and make the most of these changes, including the potential price volatility they may cause.', '1 0-1 1',

emissions close to zero (below 0.1 MtCO2e/year), which would be fully offset by nature-based carbon sink solutions.', '• Around half of the energy produced by TotalEnergies would be renewable electricity with corresponding storage capacity, or around 500 TWh/year.', 'This would require developing around 400 GW of renewable capacity [2030 target: 100 GW in 10 years and 120 TWh/year].', '• New molecules would account for around 25% of the energy produced by Total Energies, equivalent to 50 Mt/year, in the form of biogas, hydrogen, or synthetic liquid fuels from the following circular reaction: H2 + CO2 e-fuels.', '• TotalEnergies would produce around 1 Mb/day of hydrocarbons (or close to four times less than in 2030, in line with the reduction outlined in the IEA’s Net Zero

the adoption of carbon pricing, and applies an internal carbon price when evaluating its own projects (see p. 32-33).', 'By integrating an energy source’s carbon content in its price, carbon pricing makes the most emission-intensive sources more expensive.', 'In particular, putting a price on carbon gives all players an incentive to shift faster from coal to renewable energies and natural gas for electricity production.', 'Over the long term, it also offers a way to channel investment to research into low-carbon technologies and carbon capture and storage.', 'The launch of China’s emissions

the pricing disparities from country to country, the Company also supports the creation of Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanisms to prevent what is known as “carbon leakage.” In Europe, for example, the price of carbon surpassed €80 per ton on the ETS market (industrial facilities and power generation) in 2021, whereas most industrial operators outside Europe are not exposed to such high carbon costs.', 'As a result, there is a risk that production could relocate to regions with less ambitious climate objectives, which would not only penalize employment in Europe but also negate efforts to reduce emissions worldwide.', 'Draft legislation to establish Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanisms is pending at the European Union, and proposals are also under consideration in the United States and Canada, among other countries.', 'Any such legislation must ensure that the lowestemitting facilities remain competitive while encouraging trade partners to establish their own carbon pricing systems.', 'the European ETS market and the return of the United States to discussions on climate all augur positively for the development of carbon pricing.', 'According to the World Bank’s Carbon Pricing Dashboard, more than 21% of global emissions are now covered by 64 carbon pricing systems worldwide.', 'Since 2014 the Company has been supporting a range of international initiatives that call for the implementation of regulatory mechanisms tailored to local conditions.', 'TotalEnergies is a founding member of the Climate Leadership Council (CLC), which promotes a balanced approach to

our position in Russia – and drives us to support the humanitarian efforts in the region.', 'As I write this letter, our thoughts remain with everyone affected by what is happening.', 'Sustainability, resilience and safety As well as embedding sustainability across our strategy, we designed it to be resilient across a wide range of scenarios.', 'As recent events heighten uncertainty and global energy security concerns, we are positioned to help keep the energy flowing that the world desperately needs.', 'We do this recognizing that nothing is more important than safety.', 'While we have seen some improvements in our safety performance over the past year, tragically a bp contractor died in an accident at our Castellon refinery in Spain.', 'We have more work to do to eliminate accidents and injuries so that everyone goes home safe to their loved ones every day.', 'Nothing is more important.', 'Leaning into greening The strategic progress we have made so far, and the pace at which society has been moving on sustainability, has given us confidence to accelerate the greening of bp.', 'We now expect that by 2025, more than 40% of our capital expenditure will be in our transition growth businesses, and around 50% by 2030.', '1', 'bp sustainability report 2021', 'We have also increased our net zero aims.', 'On aim 1, we are now aiming to cut our operational emissions in half by 2030 (up from 30-35%).', 'And on aim 3 (covering the lifecycle emissions for the energy products we sell) we now aim to reduce carbon intensity to net zero by 2050 or sooner – up from 50% – and have increased the volume of emissions covered by this aim, which now includes physically traded sales of energy products.', 'Uniquely among our peers, we are aiming to be net zero across operations, production and sales.', 'Diversifying and decarbonizing We have a lot more to learn, but our experience so far is that our purpose – reimagining energy for people and our planet – can help us diversify and decarbonize bp and at the same time create real value and returns for our shareholders.', 'What does that mean in practice?', 'It means that by doubling down on five transition growth engines where we have real strengths – bioenergy, convenience, EV charging, renewables and hydrogen – we can grow as a company and at the same time advance towards our aim of net zero on the products we sell (aim 3).', 'Or take our aim 4, which is to install methane measurement at all our major oil and gas processing sites by 2023.', 'While we work towards that, our methane intensity has come down by more than 40% since 2019 (from 0.12 to 0.07%).', 'This includes reduced operational methane emissions, and more bp-produced gas available to sell to our customers.', 'And at our Gelsenkirchen sites in Germany, we have reduced our Scope 2 emissions by more than half-a-million tonnes in 2021 (in line with aim 1), helped by our trading team’s long-term arrangement to purchase renewable energy.', 'Focused on delivery With our direction set, and the major organizational changes behind us, we are now fully focused on delivering our strategy and the sustainability aims that underpin it.', 'Thank

wants and needs into the future.', 'Sustainability in action Against this backdrop, and as we have seen the world’s low carbon ambitions gather momentum, we have been in action across the three focus areas – net zero, people and planet.', 'Our aims have helped us plan and prioritize our work.', 'In 2021, that work was about continuing to deliver in the areas that, for bp, are more mature, while defining and embedding our newer aims in areas where we are building our understanding of what is needed, and what methodologies and structures will best enable us to deliver.', 'Performance and progress This report sets out our performance against those aims where we have clear targets and goals, as well as our progress in the areas that are less well defined.', 'To share a few examples, this includes: • Quadrupling our renewables development pipeline to over 23GW including 5.2GW in offshore wind (contributing to our aim 11).', '• Reducing operational Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 35%

transition (aim 12) and our partnership with Aberdeen to help them deliver their net zero vision (aim 10).', 'Interconnected aims Our aims are connected to the three pillars of our strategy – resilient hydrocarbons, convenience and mobility, and low carbon energy – and many are also connected to each other.', 'Perhaps the clearest example is Net Zero Teesside and the related projects that bp is leading in the NorthEast of England.', 'We are working to develop firstof-a-kind gas-fired power generation with carbon capture, blue and green hydrogen, and further carbon capture capacity for

uncertainties and challenges, and, like so many others, I am horrified by the war in Ukraine.', 'I feel deeply for those suffering no matter where they are.', 'All of us at Shell are concerned about our staff and contractors affected by the conflict and we are doing everything we can to help them.', 'Shell is helping in the relief effort and working with governments to find ways to secure energy supplies for Europe and other markets.', 'We also took decisive actions in support of global economic measures against Russia and you can read about them in the media release.', 'As the world faces these new challenges, and even as the COVID-19 pandemic continues, it must not lose sight of the importance of taking action on climate change.', 'Our Powering Progress strategy, which we launched in 2021, sets out how Shell can play a leading role in helping the world to reduce its carbon emissions.', 'At the heart of our strategy lies our own target to become a net-zero emissions energy business by 2050, in step with society’s progress in achieving the Paris climate goals.', 'In this, our 25th Sustainability Report, we share how we are working towards our Powering Progress goals.', 'SAFETY IS ESSENTIAL One critical area in which we simply must do better is safety, which is essential to our strategy.', 'We have made progress on improving the safety of our operations since the early 2000s.', 'We have not been able to eliminate all fatal incidents involving Shell employees and contractors.', 'The number of safety incidents increased in 2021.', 'I am saddened by the deaths of eight of our

PERFORMANCE DATA', 'ACCELERATING TOWARDS NET ZERO In 2021, we took an important step towards becoming a net-zero emissions business with a new target to reduce our absolute emissions from our operations (Scope 1 and Scope 2) by 50% by 2030, compared with 2016 levels on a net basis.', 'By the end of 2021, Shell had reduced Scope 1 and 2 emissions from our operations, and from the energy we buy to run our operations, by 18% from 83 million tonnes in 2016 to 68 million tonnes.', 'We also achieved our first short-term target of a 2-3% reduction in net carbon intensity (NCI) by the end of 2021.', 'Shell’s NCI in 2021 was 77 gCO2e/MJ which was a 2.5% reduction from the 2016 reference year.', 'We are also working with our customers and across sectors to help them find their own pathways to achieve net-zero emissions.', 'This will help grow demand for new low-carbon products.', 'But Powering Progress goes beyond achieving our net-zero targets.', 'In 2021, we started incorporating new ambitions within our business to respect the environment and to power people’s lives.', 'We also continued to support the UN Global Compact’s corporate governance principles on human rights, environmental protection, anti-corruption and better labour practices.', 'RESPECTING NATURE In this report, we have set out our commitments on biodiversity, water, and on helping to create a circular economy and reduce waste.', 'It is also of the utmost importance that we continue to work to prevent oil spills.', 'In 2021, we reduced the number of operational spills of more than 100 kilograms by 40%, compared with 2020.', 'However, in Nigeria, spills caused by oil theft and sabotage of pipelines continued amid heightened security risks.', 'We are dealing with these challenges and the impact they have on the environment, on local communities and on our business.', 'CONTRIBUTING TO COUNTRIES AND COMMUNITIES We are working with our suppliers to find ways to reduce greenhouse gas emissions across our supply chains.', 'In 2021, we rolled out a new digital platform which enables our suppliers to track performance on emissions reduction, share best practice and exchange emissions data with their own supply chains.', 'The supply of affordable, reliable and sustainable energy is crucial for raising living standards and for addressing other global challenges, including inequality.', 'In 2021, we continued to develop social investment programmes to improve access to energy in Ethiopia, Mozambique, Pakistan and South Africa.', 'In closing, I would like to thank the members of the independent Report Review Panel, who help us provide balanced and relevant reporting.', 'We have made the report more concise this year to make it easier for readers to understand our performance.', 'Each section guides you to our shell.com global website, where updates will keep you informed about our sustainability performance throughout the year.', 'This report sits with the Annual Report and the Energy Transition Report, which also provide information on our sustainability performance.', 'Sustainability is always a work in progress.', 'Shell has goals to lower our carbon emissions,

PERFORMANCE DATA', 'Report Review Panel recommendations The panel has had the opportunity to review two drafts of the 2021 Sustainability Report and provided both written and verbal feedback to Shell.', 'During this process, Shell has considered our feedback in relation to the quality of sustainability reporting, particularly regarding content and presentation of information.', 'The panel notes that while the report is situated within the wider shell.com suite of information, the panel has not reviewed content on the website, nor is this part of its remit.', 'The panel notes that Shell has undertaken significant changes to its approach in the Sustainability Report that reflect a shift in how different stakeholders access information.', 'We welcome the clear movement towards the inclusion of more sustainabilityrelated data within the Annual Report as a signal that it is business-critical and strategic information.', 'We also note that the Sustainability Report has been designed to support stakeholders who wish to access sustainability data.', 'More qualitative content and relevant information material to the organisation, which was previously included in the report, now sits on the main website.', 'While understanding the evolution of reporting, we note the importance of ensuring that readers who wish to engage further on a topic are directed to the website to find up-to-date and relevant information.', 'We encourage Shell to think particularly about providing context to sections in which data are presented.', 'Such context would help readers interpret the quantitative information in the report.', 'In addition, we suggest paying special attention to the presentation of visual, tabular and graphic information.', 'These are all useful instruments to convey complex information as long as they are accessible to lay readers, for example by providing relevant comparative elements, benchmarks and signposts to significant data points.', 'There are areas of disclosure that we welcome particularly, including continued efforts on tax transparency, supplier conduct and compliance, as well as confirming where activities such as Arctic Circle activity will not take place, as well as where they could.', 'Language in some areas has become more precise and aligned to relevant international standards and external expectations.', 'For example, Shell now uses the term net carbon intensity in relation to measuring progress against net-zero emissions targets.', 'Looking ahead to the 2022 report, the panel would encourage Shell to: Provide clear context for data that are presented; Sufficiently explain how Shell plans to reach its targets; Depict progress against targets over time; Strengthen the human rights section with more explicit information about engaging with suppliers and other business partners, including joint-venture partners, to explain how human rights impacts throughout the value chain are being addressed in line with core international standards; Clearly explain what topics are material for Shell; Provide data assurance for sustainability topics beyond climate; Draw more connections between different ESG issues [including climate and human rights]; and Present more reflections on challenges that may have occurred during the year including steps it is taking to respond to litigation, advocacy campaigns or other incidents as appropriate and taking into account external stakeholders’ expectations.', '\\ue812 More in this report Sustainability at Shell | About our data | Our standards and policies | GRI

worldwide.', 'In early 2021, TotalEnergies became a major player in biogas in France by acquiring Fonroche Biogaz, with 500 GWh of installed capacity.', 'The facility will use livestock manure from dairy farms to produce more than 40 GWh per year of biomethane; as a result, 45 kt of CO2e emissions will be avoided each year.', '— TotalEnergies, working with Engie, is developing the MassHylia green hydrogen project at the La Mède biorefinery.', 'It will be supplied by solar and wind farms with capacity of almost 300 MW.', 'The 125 MW electrolyzer will produce over 10,000 tons of green hydrogen a year, meeting the needs of the biorefinery and reducing its emissions by 140,000 tCO2/year.', '• At the Zeeland refinery, the Company plans to capture carbon from the steam methane reforming unit (SMR1) that produces hydrogen from natural gas.', 'It is also developing a 150 MW electrolyzer intended to be linked to an offshore wind field.', 'A unit to produce sustainable aviation fuels that emit less than half the CO2 of their fossil equivalents and incorporate over 90% waste materials.', 'Two 25 MW photovoltaic power plants, equivalent to the elec- tric power needs of 30,000

2015.', 'Our levers The main route to achieving these objectives is developing emissions reduction projects on our industrial sites, using the best technologies available: improving energy efficien- cy, reducing flaring, reducing methane emissions, supplying renewable electricity and using CCS for residual emissions.', 'To reach our net emissions targets, nature based solutions (NBS1) will, by 2030, offset some of our emissions (5 to 10 Mt/y).', 'Our progress in 2021 Scope 1+2 emissions decreased from 41.5 Mt in 2020 to 37.0 Mt (excluding the impact of Covid) in 2021 thanks to 120

including a significant upgrade to the OML58 facility in Nigeria.', 'CO2, From 2010 to 2013, TotalEnergies developed a pilot project in Lacq, France, involving a complete CCS chain, in which carbon from a steam generator was captured using oxy-combustion technology (a European first) and then transported and stored in a depleted reservoir.', 'TotalEnergies allocated $100 million to CCS research and projects in 2021, and by 2030 it expects to be expanding storage capacity by around 10 Mt annually.', '— In the Netherlands, the Company is studying a project to capture 900,000 tons/year of CO2 generated by the Zeeland refinery’s hydrogen plant as of 2026.', 'The carbon would then be transported and stored as part of the Aramis project.', '• In France, in July 2021, TotalEnergies joined with four other industrial companies in the Seine basin to launch development studies for carbon capture and maritime export infrastructure.', '• In Belgium, the Company and its partners are studying the CO2 Antwerp@C project to collect and transport CO2 emissions from the Antwerp industrial port.', 'In all three cases, the CO2 would be stored in depeleted reservoirs in the North Sea.', 'Developing transport and storage projects — • In Norway, the Company, together with Equinor and Shell, launched Northern Lights, the first large-scale carbon transport and storage project.', 'Approved by the Norwegian government in 2020, the project is currently in the construction phase.', 'It will allow industrial emitters in Norway and elsewhere in Europe to store their emissions.', '• In the Netherlands, TotalEnergies and its partners are studying the Aramis project designed to develop a logistics chain and hub in the port of Rotterdam to transport CO2 to depleted offshore fields, some of which are operated by TotalEnergies.', '• In the United Kingdom, the Company is working with its partners on the Northern Endurance Partnership transport and storage project, which aims to decarbonize the Teesside and Humberside industrial regions.', 'CCS PROJECTS IN EUROPE', 'Backed by an average annual budget of $100 million between 2020 and 2030, TotalEnergies aims to build up a stock of 100

agroforestry management project that will sequester more than 10 Mt of CO2.', 'management with the project', 'In support of the European Union’s ambitions on the path toward carbon neutrality and in light of Europe’s weight in its Scope 3 emissions in 2015 (256 Mt out of 410 Mt), the Company has set a specific target of reducing its Scope 1+2+3 emissions in Europe by 30% in absolute terms over the same period, as the reduction in sales of petroleum products will focus particularly on Europe.', 'Our objectives for 2030 TotalEnergies has set a target for 2030 of reducing its global Scope 3 emissions –\\u2009i.e., those from the energy products used by our customers\\u2009– to below 2015 levels, even though over the same period the Company plans to produce and sell 30% more energy products due, in particular, to growth in sales of elec- tricity and LNG.', 'Conversely, in order to prepare for the decline in demand for oil by the end of the decade, the Company has embarked on a voluntary strategy of adapting its Downstream activities in the refining and distribution of petroleum products to align them with its oil production, and it has set itself a new target of lowering Scope 3 emissions from petroleum products sold worldwide by over 30% between 2015 and 2030.', 'Deployment of charging infrastructure • 150,000 charge points worldwide by 2025.', '• 300 service

provide its customers with storage capacity of more than 10 Mt CO2/year by 2030, with the ambi- tion of lifting capacity to more than 50 Mt CO2/year by 2050.', 'March 2021: TotalEnergies signs CPPAs with Microsoft (47 MW) and Orange (100 GWh/year) that include construction of dozens of solar power plants across France.', 'July 2021: The Company signs two CPPAs, one with Air Liquide (50 GWh/year of renewable power over 15 years in Belgium) and the other with Amazon (474 MW of renewable power generation capacity in the U.S. and Europe).', 'In support of those commitments by the European Commis- sion, it has set a target in Europe of reducing Scope 1+2+3 emissions by 30% between 2015 and 2030.', 'Emissions from operated facilities have declined by approxi- mately 20% since 2015.', 'This includes 4 Mt of emissions from CCGT power plants following the implementation of the Com- pany’s new strategy in electricity to have flexible generation capacity; the decline for operated oil &

'To all our Stakeholders', 'n 2021, Total became TotalEnergies: A new name for a new ambition to become a major player in the energy transition, engaged towards getting to net zero by 2050, together with society.', 'This choice stems from a deeply-held conviction that everyone on the planet has the right to have access to energy – reliable, affordable energy that is a source of economic and social development.', 'At the same time, people expect a clear and responsible commitment from businesses to preserve the climate for future generations.', 'The energy transition is under way.', 'Our Company is transforming to provide tangible, sustainable solutions to the dual challenge of more energies, less emissions.', 'Two objectives: reporting on our progress and expanding on our ambition In 2021, our shareholders broadly supported this ambition through their vote at the Annual Shareholders’ Meeting.', 'One year later, we are publishing this Sustainability & Climate – 2022 Progress Report to show how our ambition is reflected in the deployment of our strategy and in our investment decisions, as well as to share our 2021 achievements, which demonstrate and stake out the path of our transformation for meeting our 2030 objectives and our ambition of getting to net zero by 2050, together with society.', 'This report also provides an opportunity for us to explain even more clearly and transparently our climate ambition, our progress, the pertinence of our 2030 objectives and our ability to meet or exceed them, and in so doing, show our stakeholders that we are already on the right track.', 'As we promised, each year the TotalEnergies Board of Directors reviews the relevance of its ambitions, as well as the appropriateness of its strategy and targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions in the light of progress in international and national policies, new scenarios concerning decarbonization trajectories, advances in low carbon technologies, action taken by other sectors, including its customers, and other changes in society in terms of energy transition and sustainable development.', '0 4-0 5', 'That is why, through this report, we are expanding on the ambition we submitted to our shareholders in 2021.', 'For the first time, we describe our 2050 vision of a net zero TotalEnergies, together with society.', 'Renewable electricity will account for half of its production; new decarbonized molecules from biomass (biofuels and biogas) or from renewable electricity (hydrogen and e-fuels) will represent a quarter; and hydrocarbons (oil and gas) the remaining quarter, with their residual emissions fully captured, recycled or offset.', 'This vision is not a mirage or greenwashing.', 'It is based on measurable objectives to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions in the short (2025), medium (2030) and long (2050) term, covering our industrial operations (Scope 1+2) and the emissions generated by our customers’ use of our energy products (Scope 3).', 'We affirm our ambitious target of a more than 30% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions related to sales of petroleum products (Scope 3 Oil) by 2030 compared to 2015.', 'To that, we add phased targets for reducing methane emissions (50% from 2020 levels by 2025 and 80% from 2020 levels by 2030) to move towards zero methane and an objective of less than 0.1 million cubic meters per day for routine gas flaring at our operated assets by 2025, before eliminating flaring completely by 2030.', 'Objectives aligned with society’s net zero ambition According to assessments by respected independent third parties, our target of a 40% reduction by 2030 in our net Scope 1+2 emissions compared to 2015 is in line with the commitments made by countries with a net zero pledge, including the European Union with its \"Fit for 55\" package.', 'I am also pleased that Transition Pathway Initiative (TPI) announced that TotalEnergies is one of three oil and gas firms that “have set emissions reduction targets that are ambitious enough to reach net zero by 2050 and to align with TPI’s 1.5°C benchmark.” This report also includes our analysis of the International Energy Agency’s normative Net Zero Emissions scenario, which some observers are now using as guidance.', 'Even though we do not think that our societies can match the scenario’s trend in the short term, we do share the 2050 end-point described by the IEA for carbon neutrality.', 'For this reason, we have decided to take the scenario into account, for testing the resilience of our portfolio and projects and ensuring the strength of our balance sheet.', 'Our contribution to the development of renewable energies, as called for in the Net Zero Emissions scenario, accelerated in 2021.', 'Our investments in renewables and electricity accounted for 25% of total investments, which is more than the 20% we forecast one year ago.', 'Combined with our investments in new molecules, this means that soon more than 30% of our investments will be devoted to decarbonized energy.', 'In the interests of full disclosure, we are including the taxonomy of our operations for the first time, ahead of the new European regulations.', 'Our ambition is backed by a clear and disciplined investment strategy, with the objective of channeling half of our future investments to growing renewable energies, gas and new decarbonized molecules.', 'The other half will be used to maintain our traditional production base.', 'In this way, we will be able to gradually build up an integrated portfolio of multi-energy assets that all share two crucial criteria for ensuring a commodity-producing company’s sustainable profitability in a period of energy transition: low production costs and low CO2 emissions.', 'The results obtained in 2021 back up our ambition.', 'We installed 10 GW of renewable electricity capacity, increased our LNG sales to 42 Mt (99% of which sold to net zero countries), reduced the share of our sales from petroleum products to 44% of the total from 65% in 2015, lowered emissions from our operated facilities (Scope 1+2) by 20% from 2015 and reduced the carbon footprint of our products sold in Europe by 14% compared to 2015.', 'All of these results allow us to deliver energy to our customers that has a more than 10% lower lifecycle carbon intensity than in 2015.', 'In this report, you will also find, for the first time, an assessment of the Scope 1+2 emissions of our non-operated assets and our emissions on an', 'equity share basis, as well as the geographic spread of our Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions by region.', 'In carrying out our transformation and advancing on the path to net zero, we are not alone.', 'We are working to engage customers, suppliers, researchers, start-ups and others.', 'In 2021, we multiplied our low-carbon collaborations and partnerships and we intend to drive further progress with all the players in our value chain, especially in new mobilities.', 'Working for a just transition, together with our stakeholders Since our climate ambition is intrinsically linked to our sustainable development ambition, you will also find a discussion of our efforts to have a positive impact, initiated with our stakeholders, based on dialogue and transparency.', 'We affirm our commitment to offering our employees around the world a safe, inclusive and stimulating work environment where they can make the most of future-oriented skills.', 'I would like to salute their engagement: we have them to thank for allowing us to achieve the best accident rate in our sector in 2021.', 'We developed this new ambition together – in the midst of the Covid-19 pandemic –and we are deploying it together within the framework of a just transition.', 'Respect for Each Other, and therefore for human rights, is a cornerstone of our Code of Conduct.', 'In this report, we give tangible examples to describe how we ensure respect for human rights in all our operations and how we work with communities to create value in our host territories.', 'Care for the environment is also a key focus of our sustainable development approach.', 'This report details our environmental requirements and our new objectives for biodiversity, for managing scarce water resources and for the circular economy.', 'As I write this, two realities are unfolding.', 'On the one hand, Russia’s armed aggression against Ukraine threatens people, European stability and the energy market’s equilibrium.', 'On the other, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s new report powerfully reminds us of the climate emergency.', 'In this environment, explaining our ambition and showing how it is being put in place takes on its full meaning.', 'Guided by our values and backed by our talents, I am confident in our ability to keep moving forward, to resolutely drive the transformation of our industrial model and to help, with our stakeholders, shape the just transition to which our societies aspire.', 'Patrick Pouyanné Sustainability & Climate 2022 Progress Report', ' MESSAGE FROM MARIE-CHRISTINE COISNE-ROQUETTE, Lead Independent Director and Chairwoman of the

International Energy Agency (IEA), in 2021, in order to get a better view of the underlying factors in the IEA’s Net Zero scenario.', 'In 2021, we added climate-target-related performance criteria to other sustainable development criteria (HSE, CSR, HR and diversity) in the determination of the Chairman and CEO’s variable compensation.', 'The Oil & Gas growth criterion in this calculation was replaced by two criteria concerning his steering of the transformation and profitable growth in renewables and electricity.', 'The granting of performance shares includes a criterion relating to the decline in indirect (Scope 3) emissions from the end use of energy products by TotalEnergies customers.', 'This multi-energy strategy requires a long-term view, and it will take time for TotalEnergies’ new strategic direction to produce its full effects.', 'During its annual strategic reviews, the Board will examine the appropriateness of this strategy and its targets for reducing

IEA’s Net Zero Emissions (NZE) Scenario is a “normative” scenario that describes a changing world energy demand that would be consistent with limiting the global temperature rise to 1.5°C “without overshooting the related carbon budget”.', 'The NZE Scenario’s vision for 2050 features the following: • Electrification of final demand would rise to 49% from 20% today, with 88% decarbonized electricity versus 28% in 2020.', 'The use of coal would be virtually eliminated in 2050 and capacity for renewables would rise eightfold (20 for solar and wind, 2.7 for hydroelectricity).', '• Demand for oil would stand at 24 Mb/day, down 75% from 2019.', 'The 2030 crossing point corresponds roughly to linearization of the decline between now and 2050, i.e., a 25 Mb/day decrease every ten years (very sharp immediate fall with no further acceleration).', '• Demand for natural gas would stand at 29 Mboe/day, down 57% from 2019.', 'In 2050, green gas (decarbonized hydrogen, ammonia and biogas) would account for 10% of the global energy mix versus 6% for natural gas.', '• Net zero would be achieved thanks to 7.6 Gt of CO2 storage per year by 2050.', 'This “normative” scenario requires a drastic change in energy demand between 2020 and 2030: • In the NZE Scenario, demand would drop by around 0.7% a year between 2020 and 2030 (even though the global population and GDP continue to rise) in order to immediately bend the trajectory of global CO2 emissions.', '• That would involve a massive, concerted effort with regard to energy efficiency, which would improve by a spectacular 4.2% a year between 2020 and 2030; this compares to 1.5% a year on average over the last 20 years.', '• Demand for oil would decline by 26% over the decade to 72 Mb/day.', '• Demand for natural gas would level out between 2019 and 2025 and then decline to 62 Mboe/day in 2030 versus 68 Mboe/day in 2019 (down 0.9% per year).', '0 8-0 9', 'As this is a “normative” scenario, the IEA does not present it as a forecast of changes in energy demand, but rather as a blueprint that would need to be followed to achieve the 2050 objective.', 'The IEA specifies that the NZE Scenario is shaped by numerous “uncertainties”, including the speed with which demand and behaviors adapt, the real level of energy efficiency, the pace at which new decarbonization technologies such as hydrogen and CCS scale up, etc.', 'While we share the “normative” scenario’s vision for the energy mix in 2050, the trajectory mapped out for demand between 2020 and 2030 is undeniably at odds with current trends.', 'This applies to demand for energy overall, and to demand for oil, gas and coal.', 'The IEA’s own short- and long-term forecasts, published since May 2021, do not in any way support the assumptions of the NZE scenario.', 'Demand for coal in 2021 exceeded 2019 levels, and the IEA expects an increase of 0.5% a year between now and 2024.', 'According to its latest forecasts, demand for oil should be higher in 2022 than in 2019.', 'And worldwide gas demand increased by 4% in 2021, with the IEA expecting a 2% rise in 2022.', 'The NZE Scenario requires more than 1000 GW of new solar and wind capacity to be deployed each year between 2020 and 2030, which is four times as much as the 250 GW added in 2020.', 'This only makes a collective effort to change the global energy mix, still over 80% fossil-based, even more urgent and essential.', 'The highly demanding assumptions used for the trend in energy demand up to 2030 have led the IEA to affirm that the world no longer needs any new oil and gas projects because the natural field depletion of around 4% a year is in line with the modeled decline in oil consumption.', 'Conversely, an excessively sharp decline in oil and gas supply in an environment where demand is not adjusted accordingly would, of course, lead to higher prices.', 'With this in mind, it should be noted that the current level of investment in upstream oil and gas is below the level modeled by the IEA in the NZE Scenario for 2022-2030 ($320 billion and $350 billion in 2020 and 2021 versus $366 billion a year in the NZE Scenario).', '1', 'Transforming to Reinvent Energy In affirming its ambition to be a world-class player in the energy transition and to get to net zero by 2050, together with society, TotalEnergies has committed to profoundly transforming its production and sales while continuing to meet the energy needs of a growing population.', 'The Company is developing a wide range of energies in an integrated approach (from production to distribution to the end user) in order to decarbonize its energy offering and generate a competitive advantage that will create long-term value for its shareholders and stakeholders and secure its future.', 'Sustainability & Climate 2022 Progress Report', ' On one hand, the energy transition depends on the development of new molecules (biofuels and biogas, clean hydrogen, and synthetic fuels combining hydrogen and carbon) that TotalEnergies has the core skills to produce.', 'It is expanding in these markets with a focus on circular resource management.', 'On the other hand, the energy transition involves electrifying energy uses, which requires a massive increase in the supply of green electrons.', 'TotalEnergies is deploying across the entire renewable electricity value chain, from production and storage to trading and sales, in accordance with a selective, profitable approach.', 'Its goal is to rank among the top five global producers of solar- and wind-generated electricity by 2030.', 'Concerning gas, which is a transition fuel, TotalEnergies is pursuing its development across the liquefied natural gas (LNG) value chain to strengthen its position as the world’s thirdlargest LNG company.', 'LNG plays a key role in the net zero roadmaps of numerous coal-consuming countries and is the ideal partner to intermittent renewable energies.', 'As for oil, the Company is very selective and focuses its investments on low breakeven, low emissions projects.', 'As they evolve, energy markets are becoming increasingly interconnected and interdependent, particularly since electricity – the energy at the center of the transition – is a secondary energy, meaning that it depends on other energies and markets.', 'What’s more, electricity will be increasingly produced from intermittent sources that depend on weather factors that cannot be controlled.', 'Our integrated multi-energy strategy, combined with its solid financial base, are strengths and sources of resilience

price of carbon surpassed €80 per ton on the ETS market (industrial facilities and power generation) in 2021, whereas most industrial operators outside Europe are not exposed to such high carbon costs.', 'As a result, there is a risk that production could relocate to regions with less ambitious climate objectives, which would not only penalize employment in Europe but also negate efforts to reduce emissions worldwide.', 'Draft legislation to establish Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanisms is pending at the European Union, and proposals are also under consideration in the United States and Canada, among other countries.', 'Any such legislation must ensure that the lowestemitting facilities remain competitive while encouraging trade partners to establish their own carbon pricing systems.', 'the European ETS market and the return of the United States to discussions on climate all augur positively for the development of carbon pricing.', 'According to the World Bank’s Carbon Pricing Dashboard, more than 21% of global emissions are now covered by 64 carbon pricing systems worldwide.', 'Since 2014 the Company has been supporting a range of international initiatives that call for the implementation of regulatory mechanisms tailored to local conditions.', 'TotalEnergies is a founding member of the Climate Leadership Council (CLC), which promotes a balanced approach to

our position in Russia – and drives us to support the humanitarian efforts in the region.', 'As I write this letter, our thoughts remain with everyone affected by what is happening.', 'Sustainability, resilience and safety As well as embedding sustainability across our strategy, we designed it to be resilient across a wide range of scenarios.', 'As recent events heighten uncertainty and global energy security concerns, we are positioned to help keep the energy flowing that the world desperately needs.', 'We do this recognizing that nothing is more important than safety.', 'While we have seen some improvements in our safety performance over the past year, tragically a bp contractor died in an accident at our Castellon refinery in Spain.', 'We have more work to do to eliminate accidents and injuries so that everyone goes home safe to their loved ones every day.', 'Nothing is more important.', 'Leaning into greening The strategic progress we have made so far, and the pace at which society has been moving on sustainability, has given us confidence to accelerate the greening of bp.', 'We now expect that by 2025, more than 40% of our capital expenditure will be in our transition growth businesses, and around 50% by 2030.', '1', 'bp sustainability report 2021', 'We have also increased our net zero aims.', 'On aim 1, we are now aiming to cut our operational emissions in half by 2030 (up from 30-35%).', 'And on aim 3 (covering the lifecycle emissions for the energy products we sell) we now aim to reduce carbon intensity to net zero by 2050 or sooner – up from 50% – and have increased the volume of emissions covered by this aim, which now includes physically traded sales of energy products.', 'Uniquely among our peers, we are aiming to be net zero across operations, production and sales.', 'Diversifying and decarbonizing We have a lot more to learn, but our experience so far is that our purpose – reimagining energy for people and our planet – can help us diversify and decarbonize bp and at the same time create real value and returns for our shareholders.', 'What does that mean in practice?', 'It means that by doubling down on five transition growth engines where we have real strengths – bioenergy, convenience, EV charging, renewables and hydrogen – we can grow as a company and at the same time advance towards our aim of net zero on the products we sell (aim 3).', 'Or take our aim 4, which is to install methane measurement at all our major oil and gas processing sites by 2023.', 'While we work towards that, our methane intensity has come down by more than 40% since 2019 (from 0.12 to 0.07%).', 'This includes reduced operational methane emissions, and more bp-produced gas available to sell to our customers.', 'And at our Gelsenkirchen sites in Germany, we have reduced our Scope 2 emissions by more than half-a-million tonnes in 2021 (in line with aim 1), helped by our trading team’s long-term arrangement to purchase renewable energy.', 'Focused on delivery With our direction set, and the major organizational changes behind us, we are now fully focused on delivering our strategy and the sustainability aims that underpin it.', 'Thank

conflict in Ukraine is devastating.', 'As Bernard says in his introduction, our purpose is guiding us as we look to help in the ways we can.', 'One is by supporting organizations providing comfort, shelter and aid.', 'Another is by maintaining our focus on keeping energy flowing today while transforming bp to sustainably deliver more and more of the reliable, affordable, clean energy the world wants and needs into the future.', 'Sustainability in action Against this backdrop, and as we have seen the world’s low carbon ambitions gather momentum, we have been in action across the three focus areas – net zero, people and planet.', 'Our aims have helped us plan and prioritize our work.', 'In 2021, that work was about continuing to deliver in the areas that, for bp, are more mature, while defining and embedding our newer aims in areas where we are building our understanding of what is needed, and what methodologies and structures will best enable us to deliver.', 'Performance and progress This report sets out our performance against those aims where we have clear targets and goals, as well as our progress in the areas that are less well defined.', 'To share a few examples, this includes: • Quadrupling our renewables development pipeline to over 23GW including 5.2GW in offshore wind (contributing to our aim 11).', '• Reducing operational Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 35% compared to the 2019 baseline (aim 1).', '2', 'bp sustainability report 2021', '• Evaluating our net positive impact methodology for biodiversity at some of our projects, including the Tangguh

transition (aim 12) and our partnership with Aberdeen to help them deliver their net zero vision (aim 10).', 'Interconnected aims Our aims are connected to the three pillars of our strategy – resilient hydrocarbons, convenience and mobility, and low carbon energy – and many are also connected to each other.', 'Perhaps the clearest example is Net Zero Teesside and the related projects that bp is leading in the NorthEast of England.', 'We are working to develop firstof-a-kind gas-fired power generation with carbon capture, blue and green hydrogen, and further carbon capture capacity for storing emissions from UK industries.', 'As well as developing bp’s interests in each of these business areas, successful delivery of these projects would', 'support low carbon energy investment (aims 5 and 11); decarbonization of regions, cities and corporates (aim 10); a just transition (aim 12); and support and create thousands of skilled jobs (aim 13).', 'Putting sustainability at the core of bp Approaching strategy and sustainability in this integrated way is enabling us to prioritize and capture the opportunities in the energy transition – those best aligned to bp’s capabilities and

our staff and contractors affected by the conflict and we are doing everything we can to help them.', 'Shell is helping in the relief effort and working with governments to find ways to secure energy supplies for Europe and other markets.', 'We also took decisive actions in support of global economic measures against Russia and you can read about them in the media release.', 'As the world faces these new challenges, and even as the COVID-19 pandemic continues, it must not lose sight of the importance of taking action on climate change.', 'Our Powering Progress strategy, which we launched in 2021, sets out how Shell can play a leading role in helping the world to reduce its carbon emissions.', 'At the heart of our strategy lies our own target to become a net-zero emissions energy business

PERFORMANCE DATA', 'ACCELERATING TOWARDS NET ZERO In 2021, we took an important step towards becoming a net-zero emissions business with a new target to reduce our absolute emissions from our operations (Scope 1 and Scope 2) by 50% by 2030, compared with 2016 levels on a net basis.', 'By the end of 2021, Shell had reduced Scope 1 and 2 emissions from our operations, and from the energy we buy to run our operations, by 18% from 83 million tonnes in 2016 to 68 million tonnes.', 'We also achieved our first short-term target of a 2-3% reduction in net carbon intensity (NCI) by the end of 2021.', 'Shell’s NCI in 2021 was 77 gCO2e/MJ which was a 2.5% reduction from the 2016 reference year.', 'We are also working with our customers and across sectors to help them find their own pathways to achieve net-zero emissions.', 'This will help grow demand for new low-carbon products.', 'But Powering Progress goes beyond achieving our net-zero targets.', 'In 2021, we started incorporating new ambitions within our business to respect the environment and to power people’s lives.', 'We also continued to support the UN Global Compact’s corporate governance principles on human rights, environmental protection, anti-corruption and better labour practices.', 'RESPECTING NATURE In this report, we have set out our commitments on biodiversity, water, and on helping to create a circular economy and reduce waste.', 'It is also of the utmost importance that we continue to work to prevent oil spills.', 'In 2021, we reduced the number of operational spills of more than 100 kilograms by 40%, compared with 2020.', 'However, in Nigeria, spills caused by oil theft and sabotage of pipelines continued amid heightened security risks.', 'We are dealing with these challenges and the impact they have on the environment, on local communities and on our business.', 'CONTRIBUTING TO COUNTRIES AND COMMUNITIES We are working with our suppliers to find ways to reduce greenhouse gas emissions across our supply chains.', 'In 2021, we rolled out a new digital platform which enables our suppliers to track performance on emissions reduction, share best practice and exchange emissions data with their own supply chains.', 'The supply of affordable, reliable and sustainable energy is crucial for raising living standards and for addressing other global challenges, including inequality.', 'In 2021, we continued to develop social investment programmes to improve access to energy in Ethiopia, Mozambique, Pakistan and South Africa.', 'In closing, I would like to thank the members of the independent Report Review Panel, who help us provide balanced and relevant reporting.', 'We have made the report more concise this year to make it easier for readers to understand our performance.',

Shell.', 'During this process, Shell has considered our feedback in relation to the quality of sustainability reporting, particularly regarding content and presentation of information.', 'The panel notes that while the report is situated within the wider shell.com suite of information, the panel has not reviewed content on the website, nor is this part of its remit.', 'The panel notes that Shell has undertaken significant changes to its approach in the Sustainability Report that reflect a shift in how different stakeholders access information.', 'We welcome the clear movement towards the inclusion of more sustainabilityrelated data within the Annual Report as a signal that it is business-critical and strategic information.', 'We also note that the Sustainability Report has been designed to support stakeholders who wish to access sustainability data.', 'More qualitative content and relevant information material to the organisation, which was previously included in the report, now sits on the main website.', 'While understanding the evolution of reporting, we note the importance of ensuring that readers who wish to engage further on a topic are directed to the website to find up-to-date and relevant information.', 'We encourage Shell to think particularly about providing context to sections in which data are presented.', 'Such context would help readers interpret the quantitative information in the report.', 'In addition, we suggest paying special attention to the presentation of visual, tabular and graphic information.', 'These are all useful instruments to convey complex information as long as they are accessible to lay readers, for example by providing relevant comparative elements, benchmarks and signposts to significant data points.', 'There are areas of disclosure that we welcome particularly, including continued efforts on tax transparency, supplier conduct and compliance, as well as confirming where activities such as Arctic Circle activity will not take place, as well as where they could.', 'Language in some areas has become more precise and aligned to relevant international standards and external expectations.', 'For example, Shell now uses the term net carbon intensity in relation to measuring progress against net-zero emissions targets.', 'Looking ahead to the 2022 report, the panel would encourage Shell to: Provide clear context for data that are presented; Sufficiently explain how Shell plans to reach its targets; Depict progress against targets over time; Strengthen the human rights section with more explicit information about engaging with suppliers and other business partners, including joint-venture partners, to explain how human rights impacts throughout the value chain are being addressed in line with core international standards; Clearly explain what topics are material for Shell; Provide data assurance for sustainability topics beyond climate; Draw more connections between different ESG issues [including climate and human rights]; and Present more reflections on challenges that may have occurred during the year including steps it is taking to respond to litigation, advocacy campaigns or other incidents as appropriate and taking into account external stakeholders’ expectations.', '\\ue812 More in this report Sustainability at Shell | About our data | Our standards and policies | GRI

estimates to 2020 from various sources, particularly the extensive International Energy Agency energy statistics.', 'As with Sky, this scenario assumes that society achieves the 1.5°C stretch goal of the Paris Agreement.', 'It is rooted in stretching but realistic development dynamics today but explores a goal-oriented way to achieve that ambition.', 'We worked back in designing how this could occur, considering the realities of the situation today and taking into account realistic timescales for change.', 'Of course, there is a range of possible paths in detail that society could take to achieve this goal.', 'Although achieving the goal of the Paris Agreement and the future depicted in Sky 1.5 while maintaining a growing global economy will be extremely challenging, today it is still a technically possible path.', 'SHELL’S NET CARBON FOOTPRINT Also, in this report we may refer to Shell’s \"Net Carbon Footprint\" or \"Net Carbon Intensity\", which include Shell’s carbon emissions from the production of our energy products, our suppliers’ carbon emissions in supplying energy for that production and our customers’ carbon emissions associated with their use of the energy products we sell.', 'Shell only controls its own emissions.', 'The use of the term Shell’s \"Net Carbon Footprint\" or \"Net Carbon Intensity\" are for convenience only and not intended to suggest these emissions are those of Shell plc or its subsidiaries.', 'SHELL’S NET-ZERO EMISSIONS TARGET Shell’s operating plan, outlook and budgets are forecasted for a ten-year period and are updated every year.', 'They reflect the current economic environment and what we can reasonably expect to see over the next ten years.', 'Accordingly, they reflect our Scope 1, Scope 2 and Net Carbon Footprint (NCF) targets over the next ten years.', 'However, Shell’s operating plans cannot reflect our 2050 net-zero emissions target and 2035 NCF target, as these targets are currently outside our planning period.', 'In the future, as society moves towards net-zero emissions, we expect Shell’s operating plans to reflect this movement.', 'However, if society is not net zero in 2050, as of today, there

those Non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures is dependent on future events some of which are outside the control of Shell, such as oil and gas prices, interest rates and exchange rates.', 'Moreover, estimating such GAAP measures with the required precision necessary to provide a meaningful reconciliation is extremely difficult and could not be accomplished without
