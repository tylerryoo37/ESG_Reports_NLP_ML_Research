emissions are attributed to enteric emissions (from the animals’ digestive systems), 34% from feed source and 11% from manure management.', 'The remaining (15%) of emissions are from fertilizer usage, fuel and electricity.', 'We see animal welfare as inseparable from the climate impact of dairy farming – there is a clear link between healthy, productive animals and lower emissions.', 'So we are working with farmers on both fronts – to decrease emissions and improve animal welfare.', 'Typical elements for carbon improvement at a farm level include the selection of feed sources, fertilizer and slurry usage, herd health and yield from forage.', 'We have initially focused on our liquid milk supply, where we have the closest relationship with our farmer suppliers.', 'This is a key step towards working with our remaining supplier network to monitor carbon emissions on farm, set reduction targets and report on progress.', 'At Mondelēz our goal is to reduce our end-to-end CO2e emissions by 10%

our value chain and has formed strategic partnerships with communities, NGOs, governments and suppliers to eliminate it from occurring within cocoa communities.', 'In cocoa-growing communities, child labor is a complex issue resulting from a mix of poverty, cultural norms and misunderstandings about what constitutes appropriate child work.', 'In many communities, child-appropriate work on the family farm or in the household is an important part of young people’s learning and cultural development.', 'However, a lack of stable income and educational opportunities in rural areas can lead families to depend on children putting in long hours at home and on the farms, which are often the families’ sole source of income.', 'Paired with lack of awareness about appropriate work, this puts children at risk of performing farm work that is hazardous to their health and development.', 'Not only does child labor pose a potential danger to children, it also plays a role in further entrenching intergenerational poverty in rural communities.', 'Hershey has developed a multifaceted approach that includes improving community and farmer awareness.', 'We also invest in preventive, supplier-led approaches that monitor farmers to check that child labor is not occurring and providing resources and oversight to help remediate instances of child labor if they are found.', 'What Is Child Labor?', 'Hershey uses the International Labour Organization (ILO) definition: Child labor is work that is mentally, physically, socially or morally dangerous and harmful to children and/or interferes with their schooling.', 'Not all work performed by children, such as helping their parents around the home and assisting in a family business, is classified as child labor.', 'Such activities are sometimes referred to as “light work.” The worst forms of child labor put children at the greatest risk and are the highest priority for elimination.', 'Most instances of inappropriate child labor involve tasks such as carrying heavy loads like firewood or water, contact with agrochemicals or clearing of land with sharp tools.', 'Child labor is distinct from forced labor, which is defined by the ILO as: Situations in which persons are coerced to work through the use of violence or intimidation, or by more subtle means such as accumulated debt, retention of identity papers or threats of denunciation to immigration authorities.', 'Hershey is a member of ICI’s Forced Labor Sub-Group, working with our peers and technical experts to advance knowledge, skills, and action on preventing, monitoring, identifying and addressing forced labor in cocoa supply chains.', 'Identifying and Addressing Child Labor Our regular review of key risks in the cocoa supply chain (as outlined in our cocoa due diligence process on page 23) continues to highlight the importance of monitoring, preventing and remediating instances of child labor.', 'CLMRS, championed by the ICI and proven to be an effective measure in helping to protect against child labor, is the leading method of child labor detection and remediation among children aged 5–17 years old.', 'It is implemented by supply chain partners and community-based groups that identify child labor and monitor and help remediate when cases are found.', 'Supply chain partners are responsible for collecting and reporting on this data.', 'Hershey began implementing industry aligned best practice CLMRS executed by supply chain and community partners in 2018.', 'Supply chain and community partners identify potential child labor situations and investigate, monitor and remediate when cases are found.', 'For Hershey, “remediated” means that through our supply chain partners a child has received mitigation efforts appropriate to their situation, such as being enrolled in school.', 'As a result, the child no longer participates in activities defined as child labor and is no longer at risk of being enlisted to undertake these activities.', 'Due to case-by-case differences between child labor situations, remediation can be done at the child, household or community level.', 'Remediation responsiveness, therefore, can range from almost instant (e.g., household awareness training that is conducted when data is collected and/or cases found) to 6–18 months (e.g., renovation of classrooms or school canteens to get kids back to school).', 'Children identified as victims of child labor receive two or three follow-up visits over several months to establish whether they are out of child labor.', 'Continued monitoring then reveals whether those children stay out of child labor consistently or are identified once more engaging in potentially hazardous activities.', '25', 'The Big Picture', 'The Hershey Company | 2021 ESG

additional follow-up by local authorities.', 'By increasing farmers’ awareness of what constitutes child labor (such as children carrying heavy loads and being exposed to farm pesticides) and

pruning of cocoa trees helps to prevent tree mold and diseases and reduces the need for farmers to apply agrochemicals and pesticides.', 'The Big Picture', 'Our Company', 'Cocoa', 'In addition to providing an invaluable service to farmers, in 2021, these community pruning teams provided 372 young adults (39 of them women) in cocoa-growing communities with valuable skills and knowledge about cocoa farming, while also helping to support their families with extra income.', 'Continuing Our Work to Understand and Promote Farmer Incomes In 2021, we published our Living Wage & Income Position Statement and began taking additional steps to understand the gaps between farmers’ current income and a living income.', 'Working with the research firm Ipsos, we implemented a new biannual impact assessment methodology to capture data on farmer and household income.', 'This research will allow us to measure the efficacy of our programs in addressing farmer livelihoods, including improving income.', 'In conducting our research, we use benchmarks endorsed by the Living Income Community of Practice (LICOP), which defines living income as: “The net annual income required for a household in a particular place to afford a decent standard of living for all members of that household.” Collection of baseline data was completed in late 2021 for Côte d’Ivoire and will finish in Ghana in early 2022.', 'Initial results suggest that while only a small percentage of cocoa farming households earn a household income above the Living Income Benchmark, the majority are above the national poverty line in Côte d’Ivoire.', 'Further analysis will be focused on better understanding how the Cocoa For Good program can support farmer livelihoods to increase the percentage of households above the Living Income threshold.', 'For our key performance metrics from the year, see page 31.', 'Responsible Sourcing and Human Rights', 'Environment', 'Our People', 'Youth', 'Community', 'About This

land titles, a lack of clarity on land tenure arrangements, limited knowledge of good agricultural practices and resource-challenged law enforcement agencies.', 'To stop deforestation in our supply chain, Hershey is investing in helping farmers secure land titles where they farm, spreading climatepositive farming methods and investing in protecting the uniquely rich ecosystems where cocoa is produced in Côte d’Ivoire and Ghana.', 'Since 2018, Hershey has publicly committed to no new deforestation in our global cocoa supply chain and to implementing shade-grown cocoa with agroforestry tree-planting programs.', 'In 2021, Hershey supported the nationwide “1 Day, 50 Million Trees” reforestation campaign led by the Ministry of Water Resources and Forests in Côte d’Ivoire.', 'Farm Locations and Deforestation Throughout the past few years we funded comprehensive mapping of cocoa farms in Côte d’Ivoire and Ghana where our suppliers source the cocoa volume used in Hershey products.', 'The mapping provides a baseline deforestation rate through measuring annual tree cover loss and closely monitoring farm locations for encroachment into protected forest areas.', 'Securing Land Titles to Unlock Land Value Without proper land titles, it is difficult for farmers to access financing or make necessary changes on their farms to prevent deforestation, promote reforestation and apply agroforestry and climate-smart cocoa farming.', 'Through our partnership with the USAID Integrated Land and Resource Governance (ILRG) Project, we support communities in Ghana to clarify and document land rights as well as improve land-use planning practices through agroforestry.', 'In 2021, our engagement with ILRG and one of our suppliers, ECOM, assisted 1,244 farmers in acquiring land title documentation.', 'In 2020, we co-launched with the German Agency for International Cooperation (GIZ), the Government of Côte d’Ivoire and other partners the Côte d’Ivoire Land Partnership program (CLAP) to promote affordable land titling as a catalyst for halting deforestation.', 'Due to our intervention and design of relevant land tenure documents that are government sanctioned and community accepted, this partnership was able to shorten the time of delivery and costs of securing land titles, greatly improving farmers’ access.', 'In addition, in Zégo, a town in Côte d’Ivoire’s Lôh-Djiboua region, CLAP provided members of the village land management committee with technical training on the use of GPS devices to record land rights, with a special focus on landuse contracts with tenants.', 'Benefiting from fit-for-purpose technology, community members can now record land rights locally and formalize owner-tenant agreements, something previously cost-prohibitive for these communities.', 'Continuing Our Landscape Programs We continued our Kakum Agroforestry Landscape Program partnership in Ghana, which covers an area equivalent to 20 times the size of Manhattan and includes the Kakum National Park, an intact tropical rainforest covering 145 square miles (375 square kilometers) that is home to antelopes, elephants, monkeys and a number of other endangered wildlife species.', 'This partnership promotes and supports community-led landscape management, spreads climate-smart cocoagrowing practices and provides training for extra income-generating activities.', '30', 'The Hershey Company | 2021 ESG Report', 'The Big Picture', 'Our Company', 'Cocoa', 'Promoting Cocoa Agroforestry in Ghana The Kakum Cocoa Agroforestry Landscape Project engages the chocolate and cocoa sector companies along with the Ghana Cocoa Board, Ghana Forestry Commission and the Nature Conservation Research Centre.', 'The project fosters sustainability at a landscape scale — both on farms and across the surrounding expanse of cocoa and forest lands — in the environment surrounding world-renowned Kakum National Park, in Ghana’s Central Region.', 'So far, the project has developed management plans covering nearly 40,000 hectares of cocoa, food crop and forestfallow lands in more than 80 communities that border the Kakum National Park.', 'In addition, the project is implementing cocoa agroforestry activities and climate-smart interventions that benefit thousands of cocoa farmers and their communities.', 'This includes planting more than 30,000 multipurpose shade tree seedlings since 2018.', 'The initiative supports the development of an innovative community-based landscape governance system to improve natural resource management, reduce deforestation and enhance forest protection.', 'At the same time, it aims to expand cocoa agroforestry practices and income diversification through emerging botanical supply chains.', 'Many farmers in these communities have also benefited from income diversification through harvesting and selling kombo nuts.', 'Over the long term, the project will transform the Kakum cocoa-forest landscape toward a more sustainable agroforestry system, in which forests are protected, cocoa farmers and their families experience improved well-being and empowerment, and socioeconomic and ecological resilience to

In 2021, we announced three ambitious new packaging goals: • Eliminate hard-to-recycle PVC by the end of 2022.', '• Ensure 100% of our plastic packaging is recyclable, reusable or compostable by 2030.', '• Reduce our packaging weight by an additional 25 million pounds by 2030.', 'As of December 31, 2021, qualified alternatives have been identified for more than 50% of PVC, with conversions underway.', 'The balance of Hershey’s PVC is on track to have qualified alternatives identified by the end of 2022.', 'We are driving our recyclable plan by finding materials that reduce our reliance on mixedplastic materials that are not recyclable and are actively qualifying single-material alternatives that are more easily recyclable.', 'Within this space, we expect to begin conversion on some items in the U.S. as early as 2022.', 'In addition to recyclable plastics, we are exploring paper and compostable alternatives across several regions, including the U.S., Mexico, Brazil and Asia.', 'Beyond these efforts, we continue to drive circularity by increasing our use of recycled materials across our portfolio.', 'One example is the transition to 100% recycled material for corrugate cases by our Reese’s and Monterrey facilities.', 'This effort alone has saved almost 625,000 hours of energy, over 14,000 trees and almost two million gallons of water.', 'It also reduced GHG emissions by over 12 million pounds.', 'Lastly, we continue our long-standing commitment to reducing packaging waste to landfill by eliminating unnecessary packaging.', 'In 2021 alone, we eliminated 9.5 million pounds of material through packaging elimination, redesign and downgauging.', 'Our focus extends beyond just the consumer package to include secondary, transport and display packaging where we are investing in design solutions that drive distribution efficiencies to eliminate extra trucks on the road to minimize associated GHG emissions.', 'Exploring sustainable packaging requires a holistic approach that balances safety, quality, consumer needs, and manufacturing and distribution requirements.', 'Our priority is to make sure Hershey packaging continues to deliver high-quality and safe,

(“PMI” or the “Company”) is widely known as a cigarette company, in 2016 it announced its new purpose: to deliver a smoke-free future by focusing its resources on developing, scientifically substantiating, and responsibly commercializing smoke-free products that are less harmful than smoking, with the aim of completely replacing cigarettes as soon as possible.', 'These innovative alternative products do not burn tobacco or create smoke, and therefore emit significantly lower levels of carcinogens and other toxic substances than cigarettes.', 'Nicotine, while addictive and not risk-free, is not the primary cause of smoking-related disease.', 'The primary cause is the harmful chemicals emitted while burning tobacco and contained in the smoke.', 'Eliminating combustion from nicotine-containing products is the way to significantly reduce their toxicity.', 'Thanks to rapid advances in science and technology, and a strong PMI commitment, these products are now a reality.', 'In 2016, with the full support of the Board of Directors, the Company announced its new purpose of delivering a smoke-free future.', 'Since then, the Company has fully aligned its employees with this purpose and swiftly shifted its organizational focus and resources to smokefree alternatives.', 'The Company is essentially disrupting its traditional business from the inside out and is leading the industry in this unprecedented transformation.', 'Building on the Board’s Letter to Shareholders and the first Statement of Purpose in PMI’s 2017 and 2020 Proxy Statements respectively, we reaffirm PMI’s purpose and acknowledge that, as the Company continues to transform its business and organization, its core effort to provide smoke-free alternatives that appeal to today’s adult smokers— and to work hard to convince them to switch—will not be enough.', 'The Company needs to continue earning the trust and active cooperation of a host of stakeholders, from supply chain partners to regulators and public health authorities.', 'PMI’s smoke-free product portfolio currently includes heat-not-burn products, nicotine-containing vapor products, and oral nicotine products, all without combustion.', 'Their development and manufacturing follow high standards of quality and consistency.', 'The Company is committed to scientifically substantiating the harm reduction potential of its smoke-free alternatives compared to cigarette smoking, including through rigorous preclinical and clinical assessments and sophisticated systems toxicology.', 'Our scientific findings are publicly available and peerreviewed, and we have submitted many of our findings to regulatory authorities, including the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.', 'The totality of the scientific evidence makes the Company confident that switching completely to smoke-free products is likely to present less risk of harm than continuing to smoke.', 'Postmarket surveillance is necessary to continue building this confidence and, over time, quantify the reduction in morbidity and mortality through epidemiology.', 'A smoke-free future is attainable, and the benefits it can bring to the people who would otherwise continue to smoke, and hence to global public health, are enormous.', 'However, the Company cannot succeed alone.', 'Together with governments and civil society, we can maximize this opportunity through a consensus that smoke-free alternatives, when subject to proper government oversight and regulation, are part of a sound tobacco policy.', 'Smoking causes serious disease, and the best way to avoid the harms of smoking is never to start or, for those who smoke, to quit.', 'For decades, tobacco control has focused on strict fiscal, marketing, and other measures to deter initiation and to encourage cessation.', 'These must be continued.', 'Nevertheless, while smoking prevalence rates continue to slowly decline, the World Health Organization projects that the estimated number of 1.1 billion people who smoke tobacco products today will remain largely unchanged by 2025, reflecting population growth.1 1', 'To be clear, these smoke-free alternatives are not risk-free and should not be used by youth or adults who would not otherwise continue to smoke or use other nicotine products.', 'The Company must market its smoke-free alternatives responsibly to minimize any unintended use while maximizing the switching of adult smokers who would otherwise continue smoking.', 'WHO Global Report on Trends in Prevalence of Tobacco Smoking 2015.', '7', ' Philip Morris International – Integrated Report 2021', 'Overview', 'PMI’s key stakeholder constituencies, which are fundamental to both the achieving of its purpose and to the pace of its progress, will be affected in different ways by PMI’s transformation.', 'The Company will seek to engage and collaborate with relevant stakeholders to speed the transformation while mitigating negative consequences.', 'While cigarette sales today remain the largest part of PMI’s business in most countries, this is changing rapidly.', 'The Company is actively accelerating the decline of cigarette smoking beyond what traditional tobacco control measures can achieve alone.', 'To make its progress both measurable and verifiable, the Company developed a set of bespoke key performance indicators called Business Transformation Metrics.', 'This set of metrics and related goals, which PMI reports on periodically, allow stakeholders to assess both the pace and the scale of its transformation and showcase how it is allocating resources away from its traditional cigarette business, aiming to base success on a future where it no longer makes or sells cigarettes.', 'Consumers Adult smokers and adult nicotine users are at the core of PMI’s business transformation.', 'The public health benefit of smoke-free products depends not only on their potential to reduce the risk of smokingrelated disease compared to continued smoking but also on if they are actually used as alternatives to cigarettes by as many adult smokers as possible.', 'For smokers to switch to them, these alternatives must be accessible.', 'Increasing accessibility means improving consumer awareness, acceptability, as well as the availability and affordability of our smoke-free products.', 'Acceptability means delivering experiences that satisfy the needs of adult smokers while significantly reducing the exposure to the harmful and potentially harmful constituents of cigarette smoke.', 'It is vital that we engage with adult smokers to raise awareness of smoke-free products and their benefits compared with cigarettes.', 'Although the Company’s transformation journey started with a vision centered on the critical mission of phasing out cigarettes, this is not its sole or ultimate end goal.', 'Researching and developing noncombustible alternatives that are scientifically substantiated to be less harmful than cigarettes was the first step.', 'Broadening access for adult smokers while simultaneously and deliberately working to phase out cigarette smoking completed the equation of its smoke-free purpose.', 'In the process, the Company has expanded its social, human, intellectual, and manufactured capital in ways that allow it to go a step further, moving from a value proposition centered on doing less harm toward one where it can seek to have a net positive impact on society.', 'While PMI will continue to responsibly sell cigarettes as long as there is a significant legitimate demand, it will leverage its leading position to accelerate switching to better alternatives, continuing to focus its commercial efforts toward raising awareness of, and informing adult smokers in appropriate ways about, scientifically substantiated smoke-free products and the benefits of switching versus continued smoking.', 'The Company carefully monitors the results of its marketing to minimize any unintended use of its smoke-free products by nonsmokers, especially youth.', 'PMI is now actively working to expand its purpose and evolve into a broader lifestyle, consumer wellness and healthcare company, extending its value proposition and innovative capability to commercialize products that go beyond tobacco and nicotine.', 'This is built on two key growth areas: (1) wellness products, where the Company is developing and looking to commercialize scientifically substantiated consumer health products and solutions with the aim to improve people’s lives (2) healthcare products, where it has already committed resources to its development pipeline of over-the-counter and prescription products.', 'In addition, PMI’s new businesses will leverage its know-how and capabilities in areas such as inhalation and aerosolization to create better products to target unmet medical and consumer needs and deliver a better experience and enhanced products for consumers and patients.', 'This is part of a larger transformation that puts science, technology, and sustainability at the heart of PMI’s future by building on the Company’s expertise and investment in aerosol chemistry and physics, device technology, clinical research, and best-inclass preclinical safety and inhalation models.', '8', 'Strategy', 'Product impact', 'Operational impact', 'Employees', 'Fundamentals', 'Reporting and performance', 'The Company is urging this important stakeholder group to seize the immense opportunity that smoke-free products present for advancing public health within the current generation of smokers.', 'PMI asks the public health community to scrutinize its smoke-free products, to provide feedback for improvement, and to be open to considering that PMI’s purpose aligns with the societal goal to change the health trajectories of the people who smoke.', 'PMI’s ability to accomplish its purpose depends on the skills, dedication, and relentless efforts of its employees.', 'The Company’s focus on a smoke-free future and long-term opportunities in wellness and healthcare has enhanced its ability to attract the new talent needed to support its transformation.', 'The Company compensates its employees fairly and provides important benefits.', 'It supports them with enriching job experiences, training, and education to help them develop new skills and maximize their employability in a

investments in the growth of smoke-free products and in building new capabilities in wellness and healthcare.', 'Staying competitive in the cigarette category during this interim period provides the infrastructure needed to support our smoke-free growth, allowing us to create a future where cigarettes no longer exist.', 'Notably, where permitted, it provides the primary way we engage and connect with adult smokers and trade partners to raise awareness of smoke-free products and explain why they are a better option than continued smoking.', '“We are convinced that impactful and systemic change

explore growth opportunities in products that do not contain tobacco or nicotine.', 'Combustible cigarettes The global combustible cigarette sector includes four large international

on our contracted farmers.', 'We seek to minimize the negative effects by improving the socioeconomic wellbeing and resilience of tobacco-farming communities (read more here).', 'We seek solutions

that remove carbon by restoring and enhancing plants and the ecosystem while also providing benefits in the areas of biodiversity, water, and social impact.', 'Given the multifaceted and complex nature of sustainable development, trade-offs are inherent to decision-making.', 'In some circumstances, we are compelled to make sacrifices in one sustainability area to obtain benefits in another, at least for a period.', 'In other instances, addressing a particular topic may limit how we tackle another.', 'For example, the core of our smoke-free strategy is to raise awareness of smoke-free products among adult smokers and broaden access to them.', 'In doing so, however, it is critical that we limit our initiatives to minimize the risk that our messages will reach unintended audiences—namely, nonsmokers and youth.', 'In designing our strategies and programs, it is vital that we accurately analyze, comprehend, and account for situations of forced compromise, guided by our sustainability materiality assessment.', 'Incorporating three lenses (stakeholder perspectives, outward impacts, and inward impacts), our sustainability materiality assessment serves as a compass with which to calibrate and prioritize competing ESG issues.', 'When appropriately addressed, some trade-offs can be a source of innovation, as such compromises press us to come up with novel ways to address the tensions that are present.', 'By embedding an integrated approach to sustainability within our business, we are able to monitor and tackle multiple issues simultaneously, identifying effective solutions that leverage interdependencies to make progress.', 'Necessary trade-offs such as this often occur in the course of our business transformation.', 'For instance, the manufacturing processes of smoke-free consumables are more resourceintensive than for cigarettes—a circumstance that runs counter to our energy and water conservation efforts in our direct operations.', 'We are

C A L ASSESSMENT Toxicological assessments are used to determine whether the reduced formation of HPHCs leads to reduced toxicity and reduced risk of smoking-related diseases in laboratory models.', 'CLINICAL ASSESSMENT Clinical assessments help determine the extent to which adult smokers would find the product an acceptable alternative to cigarettes.', 'They assess whether a reduction in the formation of HPHCs measured in the laboratory leads to a reduction in HPHC exposure when an adult smoker switches to the product and investigate whether switching from cigarettes to a smoke-free product has a beneficial effect on a smoker’s health profile by reducing the risk of smokingrelated diseases compared with continued smoking.', '• No combustion in our IQOS tobacco heating system: The primary cause of smokingrelated disease is the long-term exposure to the high levels of harmful chemicals generated by burning tobacco.', 'By avoiding combustion, we can significantly reduce or eliminate the formation of harmful and potentially harmful constituents (HPHCs).', '• Reduction in emissions of harmful and potentially harmful constituents: We compared the chemical composition of the aerosol produced by IQOS with the smoke from a reference cigarette designed for scientific research purposes and found that the levels of HPHCs in the aerosol are reduced on average by 90 to 95 percent compared with those found in the reference cigarette’s smoke.', 'In addition, extensive chemical characterization of the IQOS aerosol showed that there are approximately 10 times fewer constituents in IQOS aerosol than in the reference cigarette smoke.', '• No negative impact on overall indoor air quality: We also conducted chemistry and quality studies, which demonstrated that the use of IQOS does not negatively impact indoor air quality.', '• Reduced toxicity: We conducted toxicological studies for IQOS, both in vitro and in vivo, to determine whether the reduced formation of HPHCs in the aerosol leads to reduced toxicity.', 'Results from the in vitro studies show that the IQOS aerosol is significantly less cytotoxic and genotoxic than the smoke from cigarettes.', 'The in vivo studies found that, compared with cigarette smoke, the reduced exposure to toxicants results in significantly reduced lung inflammation and respiratory toxicity.', '• Reduced risk of cardiovascular disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and lung cancer in laboratory models: We conducted several systems toxicology studies to assess the disease-relevant biological mechanisms affected by exposure to toxicants, using human-derived in vitro cell cultures and organotypic tissue cultures.', 'These showed that, compared with the reference cigarette smoke, the IQOS aerosol has a significantly reduced impact on key mechanisms involved in the development of respiratory and cardiovascular diseases.', 'We also completed an in vivo study to assess the potential of the IQOS aerosol to reduce the risk of lung inflammation, emphysema, and lung cancer compared with cigarette smoke.', 'The results of this study show that, in contrast to cigarette smoke, the aerosol of IQOS does not increase the incidence and number of lung tumors.', 'It also confirmed a significantly reduced effect of IQOS aerosol on lung inflammation and emphysema.', 'PERCEPTION A N D B E H AV I O R Perception and behavior studies help us evaluate risk perceptions and patterns of use of smoke-free products among various adult consumer groups.', 'For smoke-free products to have an overall positive impact on public health, it is important that adult smokers use them, that those intending to quit tobacco and nicotine altogether are not dissuaded by these products, and that nonsmokers do not use them.', 'LO N G -T E R M ASSESSMENT We continue to assess our smoke-free products after they are on the market.', 'Long-term assessment will confirm whether these products reduce the risk of smoking-related disease.', '• Post-market monitoring and use patterns: We constantly monitor reports to identify safety concerns and health-related adverse events potentially associated with the use of our smokefree products.', 'Further, we conduct post-market studies to understand how IQOS is used and by whom, helping us measure the extent to which adult smokers switch to the product.', 'By conducting repeated studies in 53 countries among adult IQOS users, involving in total about 70,000 participants, we have been able to measure IQOS use patterns among adult users over time.', 'Overall, the data from these studies confirm that IQOS is reaching the intended audience of adult smokers (with a significant proportion of individuals who purchase the product switching fully to it and stopping smoking) and is of very limited interest to adults who have never used nicotine products or who had already stopped using tobacco.', 'Finally, our post-market studies confirm that consumers understand that IQOS presents less risk than cigarettes but is not risk-free and presents more risk than tobacco and nicotine cessation.', '• Long-term effects of product use: Long-term epidemiological data are needed to accurately quantify the overall disease risk reduction effect associated with switching from cigarette smoking to the use of smoke-free products, as well as to evaluate the excess disease risk associated with the use of these products compared with not using tobacco and nicotine.', 'Generating reliable epidemiological evidence requires that smoke-free products be available on the market for many years.', 'Further, the products must be used for a sufficiently long period by a sufficient portion of adult smokers who have switched to them.', 'This renders epidemiological studies impracticable in a premarket setting or in the early phase of market introduction.', '• Real-world evidence: We initiated time-trend studies in 2020 to complement our other research.', 'These studies use existing data to estimate the prevalence and incidence of disease.', 'They explore factors associated with health outcomes at the population level.', 'Independent evidence already links the launch of IQOS to an accelerated decline in cigarette sales in Japan, the first country in which IQOS was launched nationwide, in 2015.', 'We assessed time series of Japanese hospital data and health insurance claims for two smoking-related diseases (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and ischemic heart disease) to detect a potential impact of the introduction of IQOS at the population level.', 'We obtained hospitalization rates for selected smoking-related endpoints: COPD, COPD exacerbations, and ischemic heart disease.', 'This data came from two databases: Medical Data Vision and Japan Medical Data Center.', 'We compared rates of hospitalization for these endpoints before and after the introduction of heated tobacco products (HTPs) in Japan.', 'We found that observed hospitalization rates dropped below predicted rates shortly after launch.', 'Those decreases so far are modest but measurable.', 'There are many limitations to this type of research, and these results by themselves do not indicate a causal relationship.', 'We are therefore assessing the possibility of running the same type of assessment in other countries where HTP uptake is sufficient and real-world datasets are available.', 'In addition, independent studies that measure disease risk using epidemiology are starting to emerge (see the example from South Korea using data from the National Health Insurance Service on the next page).', '• Nicotine uptake: When a smoker is switching to IQOS, the nicotine uptake and urge-to-smoke scores are comparable to continued smoking.', 'This suggests that switchers can find IQOS acceptable and satisfying as an alternative to smoking.', '• Reduced exposure to harmful chemicals: Our clinical studies on IQOS completed to date have involved thousands of participants and up to 12 months of exposure.', 'They have found that smokers who switched completely to IQOS during the studies were exposed to significantly lower levels of harmful chemicals compared with those who continued to smoke.', 'Further, they showed that the levels of 15 biomarkers of exposure in participants switching completely to IQOS were comparable to the levels of those who quit tobacco and nicotine for the duration of the study.', '• Positive impact on smokers’ health: In a six-month clinical study of healthy volunteers, we measured eight health indicators that are known to change favorably following smoking cessation.', 'We observed that after participants had switched from smoking to IQOS for six months, each of these indicators improved in the direction expected upon smoking cessation, five of them with statistical significance.', 'We completed a six-month extension study to understand what the same markers look like 12 months after switching.', 'a 70', '• Good product understanding and low intent to use among nonsmokers: The results of our premarket studies show that the adult consumer groups tested have a very good understanding that IQOS presents less risk of harm than cigarettes but is not risk-free and that it is riskier than nicotine cessation.', 'Additionally, when assessed in the context of specific communication materials, more than 90 percent of participants in consumer studies understood that IQOS is not intended for nonsmokers, and more than 80 percent comprehended that quitting the use of tobacco and nicotine altogether is the best way to reduce the risk of tobacco-related diseases.', 'Visit PMIscience.com to read our scientific results to date with our smoke-free products',

researchers were able to showcase that, compared with continued smoking, switching to smoke-free products was associated with 23 percent lower risk of developing cardiovascular disease among both recent switchers and longterm switching.1 Long-term quitters, or those who had quit all products for more than five years, were associated with 37 percent lower risk.', 'As of the end of 2021, 21.7

appropriately, this approach can incentivize adult smokers to switch away from cigarettes and other combustible tobacco products and encourage manufacturers to channel their investments and R&D away from cigarettes and toward smoke-free alternatives.', 'The recommended price of our consumables depends on R&D, production, compliance and commercialization costs, as well as the excise taxation regime in the countries where they are sold.', 'Currently, the production costs of the heated tobacco units used with IQOS devices are, on average, somewhat higher than those of cigarettes.', 'HTUs undergo a proprietary manufacturing process that is vastly different from the manufacture of cigarettes, and they require an increased level of quality assurance in factories.', 'The manufacture of HTUs also incurs other costs that do not apply to cigarettes, such as the costs of scientifically substantiating the reduced-risk profile of these products, and ongoing post-market studies.', 'Importantly, they entail much higher commercialization costs compared with cigarettes due to the need to properly introduce consumers to these new products and explain their functionalities.', 'The combined effect of manufacturer costs and tax differences is such that the price to the consumer of IQOS HTUs is typically below that of premium cigarettes—or can even be at the low end of cigarette pricing.', 'As of the end of 2021, we estimate that our HTUs are on average priced the same as or lower than an adult smoker’s current cigarette brand for 58 percent of smokers in the geographies

global certification from the nonprofit EQUAL-SALARY Foundation following an intensive quantitative and qualitative review of our pay and related practices.', 'This independent certification verifies that PMI pays men and women equally for equal work everywhere the company operates.', 'The original certification was valid until April 2022 and we are proud to confirm the re-certification, valid until March 2025.', 'As part of the process, we conducted a quantitative compensation assessment in 2021 that confirmed that men and women are paid equally for equal work.', 'Moreover, auditors from PricewaterhouseCoopers validated additional qualitative aspects regarding equality such as the commitment of top management to gender equality and equal pay, the objectivity of our P&C pay policies

2,000 additional employees in non-managerial positions.', 'This new program is aligned with our quickly evolving environment and ways of working—particularly as we increasingly work in project-based, crossfunctional, multidisciplinary, and virtual teams.', 'The approach is built on three fundamental priorities: clear objectives for all employees derived from the company strategy, continuous feedback from multiple sources, and the incorporation of the “how” element in line with PMI’s leadership model.', 'This new approach provides a more holistic picture of the value and impact each employee brings.', 'Our training is delivered through our global e-learning platform, FUSE.', 'By the end of 2021, around 75 percent of our workforce had access to and were actively engaged on the

skills that will allow us to meet our strategic targets.', 'Every PMI employee owns their development, and we know that not everyone learns in the same way or at the same pace.', 'Consequently, our portfolio of learning products is flexible, incorporating online self-paced resources, virtual classrooms, and in-person sessions.', 'Our Global Learning Network, made up of close to 800 employee volunteers representing a broad range of countries, functions, and seniority levels, plays a vital role in informing the design and delivery of our learning products.', 'Working closely with these team members allows us to stay learner-focused in our approach and truly understand what our employees need and value.', 'Overall, more than 92 percent of our employees were covered by formal performance reviews in 2021.1 In addition to the new performance management program, we improved our talent review process in 2021 to ensure employees’ careers and development are discussed in a structured, objective, and fair manner.', 'Some of the new learning solutions we provided to our people in 2021 include: • Consumer centricity: PMI’s first global learning game, Bee Wow, is a custom, data-driven training solution focused on building consumer-centric behaviors, knowledge, and skills.', 'Since its global launch in October 2021, more than 1,500 employees have completed the game, gaining knowledge and confidence in the training subjects and implementing this learning into their day-to-day work.', 'The program continues to achieve results and receive external recognition,

The first program, developed with our Inclusion & Diversity team, was for high-potential female employees.', 'This initiative recognized that women often operate within systems built on masculine norms—systems that are still adapting to be fully inclusive.', 'With a focus on personal growth and development, the initiative was designed to provide participants strategies and tactics with which to navigate common barriers, create a sense of community and belonging, and focus on what is truly important to them in their lives and careers.', 'More than 50 senior female leaders participated in the six-month program, which incorporated virtual classrooms, one-to-one sessions with an external coach, and group activities.', 'Meanwhile, our Operations function continued to expand its voluntary lifelong learning program.', 'Designed to improve equity, be inclusive, and enable growth, the program empowers employees to choose the skills they want to learn to shape their careers in the direction of their choice.', 'There are no prerequisites for signing up for a course, and PMI offers bridge courses so employees at all levels can enter the program where they fit and progress toward higher levels and certifications.', 'The online certification programs vary in length and difficulty, ranging from a few hours up to 18 months, with some counting toward a master’s or other advanced degree at a designated partner university.', '• Leadership succession: The second program was designed to help us build a succession pipeline for our Company Management.', 'Participants in the nine-month program first established individual development plans.', 'Through trainings by external partners such as INSEAD and Duke Corporate Education, as well as individual and group coaching, the program helped participants bolster the critical business and leadership capabilities they will need to be ready to step into a senior management role when the right position is identified for them.', 'In addition to the core elements offered by our external partners, participants were able to select from a number of elective elements targeting their areas of expertise and interest.', 'In 2021, we rolled out access to all employees in our Operations function (totaling around 21,000 people), as well as to specific additional functions and geographies.', 'By year-end, the program counted around 3,000 active learners across 50 countries, who logged an estimated 38,000 training hours during 2021 and obtained 1,680 academic certifications.', 'More broadly, in 2021, we started identifying and mapping potential training and education areas in which to invest to meet the emerging demands of our company and the job market.', 'We will fine-tune and expand this preliminary work in 2022, laying the groundwork for a more holistic approach to lifelong learning.', 'This will guide our progress toward our newly introduced aspiration to provide 70 percent of our employees with structured lifelong learning offers by 2025.', 'Improving equity: providing access to opportunities that boost employability PMI is changing, and so is the world of work.', 'New technologies are disrupting the business

and sustainability performances.', 'We have set this vision and defined steps across all our manufacturing sites to guide our progress.', 'People capability development provides the foundation for this journey.', 'We want to support our factory workers in shifting from reactive tasks to proactive interventions by increasing their skill levels and supporting them with effective technology.', 'Along the way, we are deploying extensive learning opportunities (with both internal and external certifications) to help ensure our people are future-fit and highly employable.', 'Areas on which we need to focus further are employee reward and recognition, as well as career opportunities.', 'Moreover, while on a positive trend, our employee well-being rating—collected as part of a separate survey—shed light on the need to promote and protect our employees’ mental health and well-being (read more here).', 'We examine our engagement scores through a range of filters, including function, location, tenure, age, gender, grade, and working arrangements during COVID-19.', 'This segmentation helps us to shape action plans more precisely.', 'When we analyze results by gender, for instance, we see the engagement results improved compared with the previous year for both women (31 to 32 points) and men (33 to 36 points), but the gap between the genders has increased.', 'Although we anticipate that this journey typically will take six or seven years to achieve, the pace is specific to each manufacturing site and guided by the pillars of our Open+ program, our lean methodology aimed at eliminating losses and building the necessary capabilities to deliver sustainable results.', 'As with previous surveys, we will use the 2021 results to deliver concrete improvements across the company, which we will disclose in our next report.', '128', 'Promoting employee volunteering PMI has a long-standing commitment to support the communities where our employees live and work and where we source tobacco.', 'This support is provided in the form of monetary contributions and in-kind donations (see the list of our 2021 social contributions here), as well as volunteer work by our employees.', 'Beyond supporting local communities, volunteering can motivate and enrich the lives of our employees, help them develop new skills, and enhance their perception of PMI as a great place to work.', 'This is in addition to the existing customary practice of giving employees paid leave for participating in initiatives organized by the company during traditional work hours.', 'In 2021, amid the COVID-19 pandemic, we piloted the guidelines without broadly promoting them, and only a limited number of employees took part in the program.', 'In 2022, we plan to significantly increase awareness of the program among employees to empower them and assimilate volunteer work as a regular practice.', 'At the end of 2020, we established global guidelines to further encourage those who would like to contribute their time, energy, and efforts to improving life in their communities.', 'Every PMI employee is eligible to take two days per year of paid leave for volunteering activities.', 'Moreover, the company commits to match—with up to five additional paid leave days—any additional volunteer work employees choose to do on their own time.', 'Our efforts to promote

psychological safety, trust, belonging, and diversity.', 'We averaged the scores attributed to those six questions to build an “inclusion index.” At 76 percent, the index showed an overall high perception of inclusion within PMI.', 'Around half of the participants responded positively to all questions, and the experience of inclusion by women versus men did not highlight any significant discrepancy (inclusion index of 74 percent for women and 78 percent for men).', 'However, the exercise shed light on notable differences regarding individual questions.', 'For instance, questions linked to “integrating differences” and “decision-making” scored high, while lower scores were accorded to questions linked to “fair treatment” and “psychological safety.” Also, the gap between women

percent the labor hours required for the land preparation of one hectare in Malawi.', 'Meanwhile in Mozambique, we initiated a mechanization pilot which we expect will cover 170 hectares.', 'In Argentina, the mechanization program continued in 2021 with the objective to improve farm productivity, mitigate potential risks associated with manual tasks, and contribute to soil conservation.', 'These services included soil preparation, transplanting, CPA spraying, and harvesting, with the predominant activity being soil preparation.', 'In the North West region of Argentina where flue-cured tobacco is grown, the mechanization initiatives generated a 30 percent reduction in the overall labor hours needed for the various crop stages.', 'In the North East region, where our Burley farmers are located, mechanized farmers were able to reduce by more than 50 percent the labor requirements for land preparation and have achieved an 18 percent increase in yields in the last crop season compared with nonmechanized farmers.', 'In India, the focus of the mechanization program is to increase labor efficiency and, in 2021, we implemented multiple initiatives with varying coverage among the farmer base.', 'These initiatives included seeding machines, transplanters, cultivators combined with fertilizer applicator, suckercide applicators, and stringing machines.', 'The predominant initiative is combining cultivators with fertilizer applicators, with 69 machines to date covering over 2,200 hectares and more than 2,800 farmers.', 'In Pakistan, the focus of the mechanization program is to increase labor efficiency while mitigating potential risks associated with manual tasks.', 'The initiatives implemented so far include mechanical earthing up machines, mechanical transplanters, CPA applicators, and stringing machines.', 'The predominant initiatives are mechanical earthing up, where we have 109 machines, covering 3,600 hectares and around 2,500 farmers and stringing machines where we have 168 machines, covering 549 hectares and 262 farmers.', 'The results obtained showed us that, with the mechanical transplanter, farmers were able to gain 41 percent efficiency compared with manual transplanting, the earthing up tools increased efficiency by 82 percent versus the manual work, the suckercide applicator led to a 25 percent efficiency gain, and, finally, the stringing machine resulted in a 27 percent efficiency gain compared with the manual stick and tying, also contributing to a reduction of child labor incidents.', 'Robust analyses and studies to define living income values and assess current farmer incomes (and the potential gap between the two) across our sourcing markets form the backbone of our approach.', 'The insights captured in these studies allow us to track the proportion of contracted farmers making a living income.', 'This proportion increased significantly in 2021, reaching 67 percent (up from 48 percent in 2020), as a result of both important progress achieved in some focus markets like Argentina, Malawi, and Mozambique, as well as increased data availability in countries like Brazil, Greece, and Turkey.',

'Implementing targeted interventions to close the living income gap Driven by the results of our assessments, we implement various initiatives to improve income levels.', 'While we tailor activities to local realities and needs, our overall strategy is universal: Firstly, we aim to improve tobacco crop productivity and competitiveness.', 'Secondly, we seek to support households in diversifying their sources of income.', 'Improving productivity Our first focus is on enhancing tobacco production and encouraging farm efficiency.', 'We support the farmers in maximizing efficiencies on their farms— for example, by hiring only the labor required, making careful use of inputs such as fertilizer, and finding ways to increase yields per hectare.', 'The mechanization of certain steps of tobacco cultivation (such as field preparation) can maximize efficiencies by achieving labor savings and elevating yields.', 'In 2021, we continued to expand our mechanization program in Malawi and provide an opportunity for farmers to improve their productivity in tobacco.', 'A total of more than 1,600 smallholder farmers, covering nearly 2,900 hectares opted for mechanization services provided by 32 local entrepreneurs.', 'This mechanization initiative, in combination with other agricultural practices, 149', ' Improve the quality of life of people in our supply chain', 'Philip Morris International – Integrated Report 2021', 'Overview', 'Supporting households in diversifying their income sources We also look at opportunities to implement other income-generating activities.', 'Notably, the cultivation of complementary crops beyond tobacco can improve farm income while enhancing resilience against climate change and economic uncertainty.', 'In 2021, we estimate that around two-thirds of our contracted farmers also grew crops other than tobacco.', 'Mitigating the impact of the gradual decrease in our tobacco demand The growth of our smoke-free business intentionally results in a simultaneous decline of our cigarette business.', 'This translates into a gradual decrease in our overall demand for tobacco leaf.', 'Over the past five years, our demand for leaf fell 21 percent, from 370 million kilograms in 2016 down to approximately 291 million kilograms in 2021.', 'This resulted in a reduction in the volume of tobacco we purchase in some markets and the elimination of our sourcing activities in others.', 'Such change has an undeniable impact on contracted farmers, especially those whose primary source of income traditionally has derived from tobacco growing.', 'For instance, during the year, we supported the establishment of microbusiness programs in Indonesia with 104 women beneficiaries to produce backyard crops such as herbs, spices, yams, and papaya.', 'Meanwhile, in Argentina and India (reaching 236 and 360 farmers, respectively) we expanded the production of okra, cluster bean, tomato, cowpea, and maize.', 'Additionally, in Pakistan, the initiatives to produce mushrooms and backyard vegetables were expanded to close to 600 farmers and around 2,400 farmers respectively.', 'We are aiming to address and, to the extent we can, minimize the negative effects of this shift.', 'We do this through a dedicated assessment of the unique realities and contingencies that define each country or region where we source tobacco, building an understanding of the local ecosystem to tailor and implement sustainable solutions that can help farmers transition to sustainable alternative livelihoods where needed.', 'Lastly, in Mozambique, we expanded the treadlepump and winter-crop support project to an additional 1,760 farmers, bringing the total beneficiaries to date to over 3,000, with an estimated 600 hectares under treadle-pump irrigation production.', 'In some cases, farmers are not heavily reliant on tobacco production for their livelihoods, have the means to easily switch to other crops, or will continue to grow tobacco for other customers.', 'In other geographies, we provide additional support to help mitigate the negative impact of our reduced purchases (read, for instance, about our efforts in Colombia—where we stopped purchasing tobacco—in our 2020 Integrated Report).', 'Strategy', 'Product impact', 'Operational impact', 'Enhancing access to water, sanitation, and hygiene among tobacco-farming communities',

farms owned and operated by other households or companies.', 'The link between poverty and inadequate access to water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) is well established.', 'We know, too, that enhancing WASH infrastructure can substantially improve the wellbeing and livelihoods of community members.', 'Many of the gender inequalities faced by women in general are exacerbated for women in agriculture.', 'Globally, less than 15 percent of agricultural land is owned by women,1 and women involved in tobacco farming often face structural and cultural barriers such as gender gaps in earnings, financial inclusion, access to credit, employment segmentation, lack of ownership of land and property, inadequate opportunities to receive training or technical support, and difficulty balancing domestic responsibilities.', 'To ensure all farmers within PMI’s footprint have basic access to water by 2025 and to sanitation and hygiene by 2030, we developed a framework guided by the Joint Monitoring Programme for Water Supply, Sanitation and Hygiene (JMP), established by the WHO and UNICEF.', 'In 2021, we collected global WASH data through farm-by-farm monitoring and surveys, applying JMP’s universal indicators.', 'This research has identified Argentina as an additional priority market for drinking water access (alongside Malawi and Mozambique), and an implementation plan has been developed focused on springs protection.', 'We also developed water quality guidelines, water availability guidelines, and an animated training video that explains the concepts and importance of WASH to our farmers.', 'Since the inception of our ALP program, gender equality and fair treatment have been incorporated as key principles in all the countries from which we source tobacco.', 'When we evolved the program to include a Step Change approach in 2018, we seized the opportunity to strengthen our contribution to gender equality, taking into consideration the instrumental role women play in improving household economic conditions and addressing child labor and other social challenges.', 'Consequently, PMI’s ALP program now deploys across our sourcing markets several initiatives focused on women empowerment.', 'These initiatives include, for instance, self-help groups in India through which women help one another start microbusinesses, a women-only ALP task force to perform monitoring in Pakistan, and entrepreneurship training and information on healthcare services for women farmers and their spouses in Argentina.', 'Joint efforts with our suppliers on providing drinking water access in Malawi and Mozambique continued in 2021, with the drilling of 114 new handpump boreholes in Malawi, 55 in Mozambique, and the rehabilitation of 50 boreholes in Malawi and 50 boreholes in Mozambique.', 'Since many boreholes are nonfunctioning in Africa, rehabilitation is an essential part of our strategy.', '1', 'More broadly, the initiatives we implement to help contracted farmers earn a living income support the elimination of farming inefficiencies.', 'They also promote practices—such as mechanization and irrigation technologies— that improve

in Switzerland to purchase a certain amount of tobacco cultivated in the country.', 'In that regard, due to the uniqueness of the contractual relationship our company has through SOTA with SwissTabac

expected to deliver significant carbon reductions in the years to come.', 'Meanwhile, in Portugal, we completed the installation of a solar carport at our Tabaqueira factory, which we expect will reduce carbon emissions by up to 828 tons per year.', 'Our sites and fleet are the parts of our value chain over which we have the greatest control.', 'To achieve our ambition of carbon neutrality in our direct operations by 2025, we combine good management practices with strategic energy-related investments.', 'We invest in optimizing energy and process efficiencies and replacing fossil fuel-based energy with renewable sources.', 'We compensate for our absolute carbon emissions as a last resort— once we have maximized our emissions reduction.', 'Worldwide, 7 percent of the energy used in our factories in 2021 was self-generated by innovative technologies (2020: 2 percent).', 'To increase this proportion, we developed an internal tool during 2021 that creates a portfolio of zero-carbon technologies and assesses them against specific risks and attributes.', 'Decarbonizing our factories Reducing carbon emissions in our manufacturing sites relies first and foremost on promoting efficient energy use.', 'We achieve this through our Drive 4 Zero program, which establishes a common way of working across our factories, advances a zero-loss mindset, and empowers employees to identify and implement improvements.', 'In addition to enhancing energy efficiency, this program offers environmental benefits such as reduced water consumption and waste.', 'With regard to energy use, the program triggered more than 200 projects worldwide in 2021, including, for example, the optimization of compressed air, steam, and cooling systems, heat-recovery projects, LED lighting, and electric motor replacement.', 'We also look at opportunities to leverage technology to deliver significant carbon savings.', 'For instance, in 2021, we deployed across all our manufacturing sites a new learning algorithm that allowed us to upgrade our ventilation and air conditioning system, decreasing the energy required to release the same humidity and temperature factory conditions by around 20 percent.', 'This tool will help us select and implement the most impactful solutions across our manufacturing sites.', 'We are also considering the establishment of direct power purchase agreements with large-scale solar, wind, hydro, and geothermal installations and small-scale hydropower schemes.', 'In 2021, 81 percent of the electricity used in our factories came from renewable sources (up from 78 percent in 2020), and we are on track to achieve our target of 100 percent by 2025.', 'Our efforts to enhance efficiency and switch to renewables offset the increased energy required to produce our smoke-free product consumables compared with cigarettes (the extra energy required is mainly due to the additional steam needed in the manufacturing

(scope 1+2) by 2025.', 'To reduce carbon emissions in our fleet, we invest in sustainable powertrains and effective driving to optimize energy consumption while improving operational efficiency.', 'During 2021, we selected more environmentally friendly powertrains such as hybrid and electric vehicles to guide the renewal of our fleet.', 'We anticipate these new vehicles will emit 40 percent less carbon emissions than the models they replaced.', 'Since rolling out our policy, more than 40 percent of approved models are powered by sustainable alternatives; this includes all of the newly

'Operational impact', 'Setting up our Portfolio of Climate Investments', 'Assigning a price—and hence a theoretical cost—to emissions makes the intangible tangible and further incentivizes action to reduce the emissions that contribute to global warming.', 'In 2021, we created a Portfolio of Climate Investments (PCI) to standardize and provide transparency on our approach to investments in offsets and insets.', 'Such investments compensate for unavoidable carbon emissions related to our direct operations and are essential to achieving our 2025 carbon neutrality goal.', 'Our shadow carbon price is integrated into the preparation and financial evaluation of business proposals that will impact our carbon emissions.', 'This was instrumental in helping justify the approval of eight carbon emission reduction projects in 2021.', 'While the shadow price helps prioritize the business case for investments in activities aimed at structurally reducing carbon emissions, our carbon levy helps determine the investments required to abate our emissions through offsetting or insetting initiatives.', 'The levy is designed to internalize costs and support behavioral change by imposing a virtual internal tax on selected business units for their GHG emissions.', 'This helps us determine a budget for a portfolio of climate investments dedicated to projects focused on nature-based solutions and community investments in markets relevant to PMI’s supply chain and to our global environmental strategy.', 'These projects aim to generate high-quality carbon insets with co-benefits such as biodiversity protection, water stewardship, and livelihoods development.', 'Overall, carbon emissions from our offices and warehouses decreased by 46 percent versus the 2019 baseline, continuing the positive trend from 2020.', 'This is due, in part, to awareness campaigns, more accurate internal emissions reporting, and reduced office use due to COVID-19 restrictions and precautions.', 'Product impact', 'Pricing carbon', 'PMI reviewed its carbon pricing policy in 2020 and took a pioneering approach by developing two complementary internal carbon pricing instruments: a shadow price of USD 65 per ton of CO2e and a carbon levy of USD 8 per ton of CO2e.', 'During the year, we continued to gain visibility into energy use at those sites and prepared action plans to optimize energy consumption and promote the switch to renewable sources.', 'We strengthened our capabilities to collect accurate environmental data for all our offices and warehouses, up from a third of them in 2020, extending accurate data collection to over 400 locations worldwide.', 'And we continued to define minimum energy efficiency expectations for office equipment in the markets where we have initially targeted carbon neutrality.', 'We plan to extend these expectations to additional markets by the end of 2022.', 'Strategy', 'We revise our shadow price and carbon levy annually to reflect changes in our risk and emissions profiles.', 'Fundamentals', 'Reporting and performance', 'We also anticipate a decrease in the levy budget as our emissions profile shrinks.', 'Where additional funding will be required for specific investments (e.g., unlocking innovative climate solutions and R&D), the advisory committee that governs the PCI will decide on approval.', 'A set of mechanisms and rules—the PCI quality criteria— allows PMI to efficiently evaluate which climate solutions are most appropriate to pursue.', 'Core carbon principles and additional attributes strongly support the development of nature-based solutions in PMI’s supply chain that generate benefits beyond carbon reduction or removal, such as ecosystem conservation and enhancement and positive impacts on local communities.', 'To assess whether an investment will meet our quality criteria and generate a positive impact, we employ an external due diligence process managed with a proprietary methodology developed with PMI’s carbon finance adviser Clarmondial.', 'This methodology considers GHG mitigation, biodiversity conservation, and community benefits.', 'Clarmondial also supported PMI in establishing relationships that can support the company’s long-term climate, community, and nature-related targets in priority countries.', 'To ensure management’s endorsement and alignment with the mid-term strategy of the company, the PCI is supervised by an advisory committee composed of cross-functional PMI senior leaders (including our Chief Sustainability Officer and SVP, Operations, among others).', 'The committee revises and validates the proposals prepared by the project team and approves the allocation of resources to the proposed climate solutions through an investment strategy that leverages the budget generated by PMI’s carbon levy scheme.', 'To support decarbonization efforts, PMI believes that limiting the use of market approaches (offsetting) in the short-term by prioritizing direct investment in our supply chain in the medium and long term (insetting) will result in a climate investment strategy that is cost-effective, transparent, consistent, and of high quality.', 'We expect a higher annual budget in the first years of running the PCI, in line with PMI’s business emissions profile, to support investments in a longterm climate solution.', 'The financial requirements of PMI’s PCI are expected to decrease once mediumand long-term scope 1+2 carbon reduction investments become operational and generate emissions reductions or removals.', 'In 2021, PMI’s PCI invested over USD 4 million in projects in Brazil, Laos, Malawi, Mozambique, and Uganda, with a focus on forest protection, reforestation, and the enhancement of quality of life through activities such as the provision of clean water access.', 'Moreover, the PCI focused on securing high-quality offsets to support PMI’s decarbonization journey, and provided the required carbon

around 20 percent of our total carbon footprint in 2021, with emissions generated mainly by the use of fertilizers, the process of curing tobacco, and mechanization.', 'Improving curing barn efficiency', 'In line with PMI’s 2040 net zero ambition and our 2030 science-based target trajectory, we are committed to achieving an absolute reduction in carbon emissions in our tobacco supply chain of 35 percent by 2025 and 50 percent by 2030 versus our 2019 baseline.', 'To deliver on these targets, we continue deploying efforts to decarbonize the tobacco curing process while implementing additional reduction initiatives focused on the use of fertilizer and mechanization.', 'As most farmers own their curing barns, we collaborate with them and our suppliers to provide guidance and support to make the barns more thermal-efficient.', 'We support improvement projects, which typically aim to enhance combustion efficiency, ventilation, heating control, and insulation.', 'In 2021, the improvement projects we carried out increased the efficiency of 11,181 barns—adding to a cumulative total of around 94,000 barns upgraded since 2014 across 13 countries.', 'Decarbonizing tobacco curing', 'In parallel, we continued to deliver training to farmers through our suppliers on fuel efficiency, barn maintenance, and fuel sustainability.', 'We mainly source three types of tobacco: Virginia, Burley, and Oriental.', 'While Burley and Oriental tobaccos, once harvested, are air- and sun-cured to dry out the leaves, Virginia tobacco (which represents close to half of our purchased volume and is sourced across 12 markets) is generally cured using an external heat source—a process called “flue-curing.” Curing barns can be heated with coal, diesel, natural gas, firewood, or biofuels containing agricultural or wood-sawing by-products.', 'Increasing the use of renewable fuels To reduce GHG emissions, we are gradually phasing out fossil fuels such as coal and diesel in favor of renewable fuels, including sustainable firewood and biomass.', 'Our Monitoring, Verification, and Reporting Framework for Sustainable Leaf Curing Fuels (MVR) allows us to systematically monitor the sustainability of all fuel types used in our tobacco supply chain.', 'The GHG emissions of flue-cured tobacco represented 4 percent of our total carbon footprint in 2021 and close to a quarter of the total GHG emissions generated in our tobacco supply chain.', 'In 2021, we exceeded our target of having 70 percent of our purchased flue-cured tobacco cured with renewables, achieving 75 percent.', 'Having achieved a 77 percent reduction in GHG emissions per kilogram of flue-cured tobacco between 2010 and 2020, we are now committed to a further 75 percent reduction in emissions generated by curing one kilogram of flue-cured tobacco by 2025 (versus our 2019 baseline).', 'To deliver on this ambitious target, we focus on improving curing-barn efficiency and increasing the use of renewable fuels.', 'We made good progress in 2021, achieving a 64 percent reduction in emissions per kilogram of tobacco from flue-curing versus 2019.', 'Progress was driven primarily by our work to ensure that the firewood and other wood-based materials used to cure the tobacco we purchase do not contribute to the deforestation of natural primary forests.', 'Our MVR enables us to assess the risk of deforestation represented by different wood fuels, collect sourcing information on the wood fuels farmers use to cure tobacco, and cross-check that those sources have forest management plans

the conversion of curing infrastructures to enable the switch to renewable fuels.', 'In 2021, 3 percent of the flue-cured tobacco we purchased was cured with coal (down from 11 percent in 2020); all of it originated from the Yunnan and Guizhou provinces of China.', 'In those regions, we continued to support the multistakeholder initiative, led by the China National Tobacco Corporation, to convert curing barns from coal to biomass and create a fuel pellets supply chain produced from agricultural waste.', 'Local communities are playing a vital role in the project, having created a network of pelletizing plants sufficient to provide enough bioenergy to support both the tobacco supply chain and the needs of local infrastructure such as public buildings.', 'In 2021, 85 percent of the tobacco we purchased from China was cured with biomass, up from 49 percent in 2020.', 'We remain committed to eliminating coal from our curing fuel portfolio by the end of 2023.', 'Reducing GHG emissions from fertilizers In 2021, emissions related to the use of fertilizers in tobacco production contributed to 8.5 percent of PMI’s total carbon footprint.', 'Nitrogen-based fertilizers are essential in commercial agriculture to assist farmers in achieving appropriate yields.', 'Continuous decrease of fertilizer application is challenging, therefore we are addressing fertilizer emissions from different angles.', 'The drivers that will help support emission reductions globally include the preference in volume allocation to markets using fertilizers more efficiently, the increase in

genetics.', 'What is nicotine?', 'Nicotine occurs naturally in tobacco and, at significantly lower levels, in some other plant varieties from the Solanaceae family, which includes tomatoes, potatoes, and eggplant.', 'It is possible to extract nicotine from tobacco, as is done to derive the nicotine contained in nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) products and e-liquids for e-cigarettes.', 'It is also possible to produce synthetic nicotine.', 'While this process is relatively costly, there are an increasing number of products (e-liquids and nicotine pouches) that are now using synthetic nicotine.', 'Continual use of nicotine may lead to dependence or physiological adaptations to maintain homeostasis, which are most evident in the emergence of withdrawal symptoms experienced during cessation.', 'In addition to other physiological responses, long-term use of nicotine can induce changes in the brain’s reward and stress systems, which may manifest as anxiety, dysphoria, and other negative affect states during long-term withdrawal.', 'Physiological dependence, coupled with altered responses from the reward and stress system, can make quitting very difficult.', 'The route of nicotine administration (e.g., via the lung, mouth, or skin) influences the speed and amount of nicotine uptake into the body.', 'When tobacco smoke or e-cigarette aerosol is inhaled into the lung, it is rapidly absorbed into the bloodstream and can reach the brain as quickly as 10–20 seconds after the puff is taken.', 'Nicotine from oral tobacco products (e.g., snus, nicotine pouches, NRT gum) is absorbed into the bloodstream through oral tissues, and the nicotine concentration in the blood rises gradually, reaching a plateau in about 30 minutes.', 'The rise in brain nicotine concentration is slower compared with the inhalation route.', 'A certain amount of the orally administered nicotine is swallowed and absorbed, mostly in the small intestine, before passing to the liver, where it is metabolized (i.e., transformed to facilitate excretion of nicotine from the body).', 'Nicotine, when absorbed through the skin, reaches a plateau concentration in the blood more slowly than via other routes of administration.', 'However, the level typically is maintained for a longer period.', 'The rapid uptake and delivery of nicotine to the brain’s reward system via lung delivery is thought to be a primary reason for the addictive potential of cigarettes and other inhaled tobacco products.', 'When someone smokes a cigarette, the nicotine levels peak quickly (in about six to 10 minutes), and then the level of nicotine drops fairly rapidly as it is metabolized.', 'Most nicotine replacement therapies do not provide this same pharmacokinetic profile, making them less likely to be addictive but also less likely to satisfy smokers.', 'Two critical factors are the dose and rate of nicotine delivery.', 'NRTs and other cessation products can help address nicotine withdrawal symptoms.', 'The use of NRTs is recommended for eight to 12 weeks, although use for six months or longer may be necessary to achieve optimal quit rates.', 'It makes sense to use NRTs to support smoking cessation for as long as the individual feels at risk of relapse.', 'NRTs, however, are not as satisfying as cigarette smoking.', 'Firstly, they do not provide the ritual, sensory experience, and social components that complete the experience of consuming nicotine via smoking.', 'Secondly, the route and speed of absorption of nicotine is different: Often, the NRTs that rapidly deliver high doses of nicotine, such as sprays and inhalators, are more satisfying to smokers than are those that slowly deliver nicotine at much lower doses, such as gums and patches.', 'Once nicotine is absorbed into the circulatory system, it is distributed to all body tissues and organs, including the brain.', 'There, nicotine binds to specific receptor molecules, mimicking the actions of a naturally occurring brain chemical, the neurotransmitter acetylcholine.', 'Nicotine is metabolized mainly in the liver.', 'Nicotine absorbed via the lung and oral tissues reaches the brain directly without first passing through the liver to be metabolized, whereas nicotine absorbed via the gut passes first through the liver to be metabolized and is partially excreted before reaching the brain.', '202',

Risks — Are there any other events or occurrences that could materially impact (positively/negatively) shareholder value?', 'Enterprise risks are evaluated based on: • Likelihood — The probability of an event occurring given the current business and processes, including mitigating factors.', 'Risks are categorized as high, medium or low based on probability of occurrence.', '• Impact — The significance of an event occurring.', 'Risks are classified into one of three levels of impact based on potential financial impact or severity of effect on strategy or reputation.', '• Velocity — The speed with which the adverse impact(s) of a risk is felt by a company after the risk event occurs.', 'Risks are classified based on timeframe within which the event will impact the company.', '• Leading Indicators — Forward looking, early warning signal that provides an effective means for identifying emerging risks.', '• Risk Response — Risk responses are the proposed manner to address, or not address, the risk.', 'Risk responses should be the results of an evaluation of the cost versus benefit of potential risk mitigation activities and the degree to which mitigation activities will reduce the impact and/or likelihood of a risk occurring.', 'Examples include: – Monitor — Not pursuing any additional risk mitigation or management, except monitoring the risk for change.', '– Avoid — Taking steps to remove risk, engage in alternative activity, or otherwise substantially eliminate exposure to risk.', '– Reduce — Taking steps to significantly reduce the exposure to a risk and/or the likelihood of its occurrence (e.g., institute controls to reduce the likelihood or impact of a risk occurring).', 'IS SUED: NOV. 202 1', '– Share — Shifting a significant portion of the cost of the consequences of a risk to a non-Altria entity (e.g., purchase insurance to reduce the impact of a risk).', 'Altria and its companies conduct annual external scans to identify emerging risks to the

Agricultural Practices (which in part focus on reducing environmental impacts), and continuing to monitor the evolution of alternative and renewable energy.', 'In establishing our 2030 long-term environmental targets, we set a target to reduce absolute Scope 3 emissions by 18%, which was validated by the SBTi.', 'By aligning our emissions targets with science-based targets methodology, we hope to do our part in limiting warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius in alignment with the Paris Agreement.', 'Investment in R&D Our Agronomy and Genetics groups support projects and initiatives to improve growers’ access to technology in tobacco production.', 'This includes tobacco breeding that may improve tobacco variety response to severe weather and chronic physical climate risks.', 'Some of the breeding projects are projected over the next 15 years, from proof of concept to commercially available.', 'We also sponsor projects for land-grant universities in tobacco producing regions to enhance production practices and technology to include tobacco curing fuel efficiency, plant breeding and agriculture engineering, which can help us make progress toward our 2030 Scope 3 greenhouse gas

Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions reduction targets and mitigate transition risks from potential GHG emissions pricing, Altria’s companies have implemented numerous emissions reduction projects.', 'One of the more substantial projects was replacing coal-fired boilers with natural gas boilers at three manufacturing facilities in Richmond,', 'IS SUED: NOV. 202 1', 'VA and Nashville, TN, in 2014.', 'We also have current, ongoing energyefficiency projects across various facilities, including: retrofitting lighting fixtures to more efficient technologies such as LED; optimizing set-points for refrigeration systems; replacing outdated HVAC units; and, reducing manufacturing waste and water consumption.', 'These projects also help manage transition risks related to costs to move to lower emissions technologies in the future and provide Altria’s companies the opportunity to move toward more resource efficient facilities over the coming years.', 'In 2020, we made the strategic decision to set longer-term, more ambitious science-based targets for GHG emissions and renewable electricity to be achieved by 2030.', 'Climate-Related Risks and Opportunities As we prepared our disclosure for this TCFD report, we acknowledge that – as described above – Altria has several key processes by which we identify and disclose potential climate-related risks and opportunities.', '• We disclose financially material climate-related risks in our annual reports on Form 10-K. • We also identify and monitor a broad set of potential, medium-term climate-related risks that do not currently pose substantial risk to Altria, which we discuss in more detail through our publicly available CDP responses.', '• The TCFD scenario analysis workshops allowed us to consider an even broader – and much longer-term – set of potential climatechange impacts with both negative and positive outcomes for Altria’s suppliers, adult tobacco consumers or businesses.', 'We believe these layers of risk

processing and manufacturing capabilities of USSTC’s existing facilities, allowing for shifts in production to occur in the event of severe weather impacting another location.', 'Our risk assessment processes have also helped mitigate transition risks.', 'An example of this is through encouraging transition to lower-emissions technologies in our facilities.', 'Our Safety, Health and Environment team assesses risks around emerging climate-related regulations as part of the group’s risk assessment processes, guided by our Environmental Management Framework.', 'They raised the transition risk related to potential increases in GHG emissions pricing.', 'To mitigate this risk, the assessment process encouraged transition to lower-emissions technologies in our facilities, such as the replacement of coal-fired boilers with natural gas boilers at three manufacturing facilities in 2014, along with current, ongoing energy efficiency projects across various facilities.', 'These initiatives lower our GHG emissions, therefore lowering our exposure to the transition risks associated with GHG emissions pricing.', 'Engagement & Partnership We recognize it is critical for business

accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), Altria’s management also reviews certain financial results, including operating companies income (OCI) (which is defined as operating income before general corporate expenses and amortization of intangibles) and diluted earnings (losses) per share (EPS), on an adjusted basis, which excludes certain income and expense items that management believes are not part of underlying operations.', 'These items may include, for example, loss on early extinguishment of debt, restructuring charges, asset impairment charges, acquisition-related costs, charges associated with tobacco and health litigation items, COVID-19 special items, resolutions of certain nonparticipating manufacturer (NPM) adjustment disputes under the

change, I’m often asked, “What is the role of business in society today?” Our founder, Sam Walton, gave us a timeless and meaningful purpose to save people money and help them live a better life.', 'As we celebrate Walmart’s 60th anniversary this year, that purpose still guides us as we work to create environmental, social and economic progress in ways that strengthen our business and benefit our stakeholders.', 'We believe a business’s long-term success will depend on its work to help create a strong, resilient society —for all.', 'In 2005, we committed to shifting our mindset and broadening our view to take a multi-stakeholder approach to our business.', 'This means not only do we want to be the primary destination for our customers and return value to our shareholders, but we want to do it in a way that creates value for all stakeholders —including our associates, suppliers and other partners, communities and the planet.', 'As we engage and serve our stakeholders, we grow and strengthen our business—and vice versa.', 'If the past couple years have reinforced anything, it’s the need for this kind of shared value approach.', 'At Walmart, this isn’t something sprinkled throughout our business or added on as an afterthought—we strive to use', 'this approach in all aspects of our business and help guide us.', 'Throughout our journey, we have set goals, measured progress and reported on that progress.', 'And we continually push ourselves, which is why we elevated our aspiration by making a commitment to become a regenerative company—one that puts people and nature at the center of our business practices.', 'This commitment touches all parts of our business.', 'It is anchored in our purpose—and we do that in a way that strives to create equitable opportunity for our associates and suppliers, enhance the sustainability of retail and product supply chains, help create more resilient communities and operate with the highest standards of ethics and integrity.', 'Having a healthy business for the long-term requires healthy relationships and a healthy planet.', 'It also requires trust.', 'It starts with us living our value of acting with integrity.', 'We aim to do that throughout all our work.', 'There is a path of opportunity for everyone here.', 'As I’ve visited stores, clubs and DCs over the past year, I’ve enjoyed talking with the many associates who are creating long, meaningful careers at Walmart.', 'Last year, we promoted more than 135,000 associates to positions of greater responsibility and we continue to support and invest in them with job training, rising wages and by making it easier to gain a college degree or certificate by covering the costs of tuition and books through our Live Better U program.', 'In the U.S., 40 percent of management promotions went to people of color and 45 percent to women.', 'Creating opportunities for people is an important part of our work to become a regenerative company and we believe our success will depend on advancing prosperity and equity for all.', 'It is also at the heart of our work with communities.', 'When disaster strikes, we are there with food, water and helping hands—but we are there every day strengthening communities.', 'Last year, in the U.S. alone, our associates volunteered close to 1,000 hours a day to causes they care about and the', 'company donated more than $1.5 billion in cash, food and other products globally.', 'Our experience confirms for us that, when we understand what a community needs and partner with others, we can strengthen the environment to create more opportunities for the people who live there and end up with a stronger business.', 'Regeneration also means strengthening our planet.', 'This spring, we hit a major milestone with Project Gigaton™: We are halfway toward our goal to reduce or avoid one billion metric tons of greenhouse gases from the global supply chain by 2030.', 'Since 2017, our suppliers have reported a cumulative total of more than 574 million metric tons of emissions reduced or avoided.', 'Additionally, we recently raised $2 billion through our first green bond and for the past four years we have received an A or Ascore from CDP for our transparency on climate action.', 'After 60 years in business, we are reflecting on the moments of celebration, challenge and change throughout our history.', 'These milestones have a way of making you think about the future.', 'Though you’ll see some of the progress we’ve made this past year in this report, we know there’s more to be done.', 'We will continue to look for ways to make a difference and remain eager to collaborate—we need more businesses and NGOs, as well as governments, to get involved and do more.', 'This work requires collective action.', 'When our children and grandchildren look back at the work we’re doing now, I hope it’s clear we were part of the solution— working every day to make this world a better place.',

volatile; the effects of climate change have intensified; social divides seem to have widened.', 'Yet despite such challenges—or as much spurred on by them— we are more committed than ever to our efforts to become a regenerative company, one that puts humanity and nature at the center of our business practices.', 'We believe that we maximize the value of our company for our customers and other stakeholders by tackling relevant, pressing societal issues through business.', 'In the pages of this year’s FY2022 Summary and the accompanying ESG Issue Briefs, we share our aspirations, strategies, progress and challenges related to our priority environmental, social and governance issues.', 'A few observations about our FY2022 disclosures: “Who’s #1?', 'The customer, always.” In a year where so many communities turned to Walmart for access to affordable food, consumables, COVID-19 vaccines and other everyday essentials, it became clearer than ever that delivering our customer proposition is itself a central ESG contribution.', 'Progress on rewiring systems for equity.', 'Because advancing equity in society requires transformation of complex systems, our strategies in arenas such as economic mobility, racial equity and human rights in supply chains involve long-term, intensive collaboration with others on business and philanthropic initiatives extending beyond the four walls of our company.', 'Substantial improvements in outcomes may be years in the', 'making.', 'Yet we are encouraged by emerging shifts in mindsets, practices, resource flows and policies within each of these arenas as well as progress within our own company.', 'Climate action: more than promises.', 'In the lead up to COP26 in Glasgow, many companies set goals to help the world get to net-zero emissions.', 'Walmart has been engaging in climate action since 2005 and enlisting suppliers to do the same since the launch of Project Gigaton™ in 2017.', 'This year we reported that we continue to make progress toward our science-based targets for emissions reduction (for example, reporting a 17.5% reduction in FY2021 relative to our 2015 baseline for Scope 1 and 2 emissions) and we significantly expanded our efforts and disclosures related to our nature goals.', 'No simple solutions.', 'When it comes to complex societal issues, stakeholders don’t always agree on the way forward and there can be many obstacles to progress.', 'Through our ESG reporting, we aim to provide insight into Walmart’s theories of change, systemic challenges and the efforts of Walmart teams and our partners to overcome them.', 'Decision-useful reporting.', 'Investors have asked businesses for more consistent and relevant ESG information.', 'Nobody wants an avalanche of data or—at the opposite end of the spectrum— high-level headlines; they want concrete facts regarding policies, practices and results relevant to the creation of shared value.', 'We aim to set the standard for decision-useful reporting.', 'This year, we have responded to investor requests for expanded disclosure in specific arenas (for example, public policy engagement; approach to nature).', 'We continue to aim for consistency and relevance through the structure of our ESG issue briefs and approach to metrics (e.g., clear definitions; sharing progress for the last three fiscal years).', 'A rose by any other name… Debates have intensified about terminology—ESG, stakeholder capitalism, inclusive capitalism, shared value, etc.—and whether all of this is just a passing fad.', 'Our view is simple: a company’s long‑term success depends on its performance on the societal issues most relevant to its business and stakeholders.', 'We can’t have a strong business without a thriving planet and the trust and engagement of customers, associates, suppliers, investors, civic partners and communities.', 'And the fundamentals of that are here to stay.', 'We remain optimistic.', 'In Walmart communities around the world, our customers,

incorporate one of the 5Rs into new product packaging at the beginning of the design phase, allowing progress to be tracked from the onset.', 'SECONDARY AND TERTIARY PACKAGING The intent of secondary and tertiary packaging is to protect the integrity of our products while also providing a High-Touch experience.', 'We are working to reduce the environmental impacts of shipping and its associated packaging, including by selecting more sustainable materials and eliminating excess material and volume.', 'For example, many brands now use dissolvable packaging peanuts in their shipping boxes and have reduced the amount of paper used in mailers.', 'In our Europe, Middle East, and Africa (EMEA) region, new shipping boxes are free of plastic, tape, and unnecessary paper, and branded inner boxes have been replaced with plain carton packaging that is FSC certified.', 'We are also teaching suppliers about our efforts to create more responsible secondary and tertiary packaging and look forward to continued collaboration.', '89', ' SUSTAINABILITY PACKAGING', 'TRAINING We keep employees and suppliers up to date on sustainable packaging initiatives through regular trainings and communications.', 'Our objectives are to share information, capture new ideas, and listen to feedback so that we can continually evolve our programs and improve our outcomes.', 'In fiscal 2021, we conducted numerous virtual sessions: INTERNAL TEAMS We conducted two webinar training sessions on the Sustainable Packaging Guidelines, principles, tools, and updates.', 'Each training was attended by more than 100 employees across global regions and functions.', 'Provided small group (5-30 people) training sessions for our marketing, packaging, and creative teams on the process for making responsible packaging claims.', 'SUPPLIERS We hosted a session that included representatives from nearly 400 supplier representatives to review updates made to improve our sustainability data collection in our supplier specification system.', 'SESSIONS WITH EXTERNAL ORGANIZATIONS We held a virtual training seminar with the Sustainable Packaging Coalition for more than 90 employees.', 'Participants selected training topics, such as sessions on ocean plastic, advanced recycling, and life-cycle analysis.', 'We kept our teams up to date on environmental regulation changes and proposed changes through webinars with external experts from Lorax EPI.', '90', ' SUSTAINABILITY PACKAGING', 'ADDRESSING PLASTIC USE We know that plastic use is among the most pressing sustainability issues today, and we are committed to tackling virgin plastic use and working to minimize plastic waste.', 'We have developed internal plastic guidelines to help drive the reduction of virgin and nonrecyclable plastic in our packaging, products, offices, facilities, and retail spaces.', 'Our guidelines include options such as pursuing more sustainable alternatives to single-use virgin plastic packaging, replacing plastic applicators used in our retail stores with paper or wood versions, reducing plastic water bottles and cutlery in our spaces, and reducing virgin and nonrecyclable plastic used in our visual merchandising.', 'As part of our commitment, we have developed an enterprise- wide goal specific to our virgin-fossil-based plastic.', 'We have also developed a more ambitious goal related to our use of PCR in packaging.', 'Excessive plastic waste in the environment is an issue that extends beyond our own business.', 'In fiscal 2021, The Estée Lauder Companies Charitable Foundation (ELCCF) awarded a grant to Plastics for Change, a nonprofit whose mission is to empower one million informal waste collectors by providing fair market access through its platform.', 'Read more on page 51.', 'PARTNERING TO BRING ADVANCED RECYCLING TO MARKET In fiscal 2021, we entered a partnership with SABIC, a global chemical industry leader, and Albéa, a beauty packaging manufacturer.', 'One of the first projects developed was to bring advanced recycled tube packages to market.', 'Origins is the first prestige beauty brand to leverage SABIC’s advanced recycling technology to produce a tube made from previously difficult-to-recycle, post-consumer mixed plastics material.', 'The brand’s global best-selling mask, Clear Improvement™ Active Charcoal Mask, is now packaged in a tube composed of a circular polymer resin made using SABIC’s certified circular polyethylene and polypropylene advanced recycling technology.', 'By using this recycling technology, we are helping to drive innovation toward the goal of a circular plastic economy.', 'WHAT IS ADVANCED (CHEMICAL) RECYCLING?', 'Traditional recycling streams for plastics are limited, and plastics can only be recycled a finite number of times.', 'Advanced recycling returns hard-to-recycle plastic back to its basic chemical building blocks.', 'Once the plastic has been broken down to its molecular state, it is then used to create high-performance plastics akin to a virgin material.', 'The use of advanced recycled material is an exciting technological development to support our sustainable packaging goals as this technology widens the scope of application in our packaging portfolio.', '91', 'OUR NEW GOAL In fiscal 2021, we established a new goal that by the end of calendar year 2030, we will reduce the amount of virgin petroleum plastic in our packaging to 50% or less.', 'SUSTAINABILITY PACKAGING', 'PACKAGING INNOVATION IN ACTION Our brands continue to enhance the sustainability profile of packaging within their portfolios.', 'In fiscal 2021, highlights included: CLINIQUE Launched PCR and bioresin blend in certain packages (bottles) and PCR in caps.', 'ORIGINS Launched tubes and caps made with at least 86% advanced recycled PCR, transitioned some products from plastic to glass, and made a refillable package for certain products.', 'SMASHBOX Removed tertiary carriers from finished goods to reduce packaging materials, launched holiday sets with FSC-certified paperboard platforms instead of plastic, and launched PCR in some packages.', 'AVEDA 80% of Aveda high-density polyethylene (HDPE) plastic bottles use a minimum of 80% PCR content and more than 85% of Aveda’s skin care and styling PET bottles and jars contain 100% post-consumer recycled materials.', 'In fiscal 2021, Aveda also launched: • A limited-edition shampoo bar in a 100% PCR FSC-certified fiber carton • A new 350 ml mono-material tube with 65% PCR content (PP plastic), which is the highest percentage we have developed to date in a mono-material tube.', 'ADVANCED NIGHT REPAIR: AN ICONIC PRODUCT NOW IN GLASS Aligned to our objective to reduce plastic use, in fiscal 2021 our Estée Lauder brand launched the Advanced Night Repair Synchronized Multi-Recovery Complex with the iconic bottle reimagined, housed in a new, expertly crafted, recyclable glass bottle.', 'Switching the Advanced Night Repair Serum bottles sold globally from plastic to glass avoids millions of plastic bottles per year.', '*Includes the following bottle sizes: 20 ml, 30 ml, 50 ml, 75 ml, 100 ml, 115 ml.', '92', ' SUSTAINABILITY PACKAGING', 'INCREASING THE USE OF RECYCLED PLASTICS IN LUXURY COSMETICS PACKAGING In fiscal 2021, we entered into an agreement with Eastman, a specialty materials provider to enable us to begin incorporating packaging solutions enabled by Eastman’s molecular recycling technologies and portfolio of Renew resins with up to 100% certified recycled content.', '* This is the first sustainability-based agreement between Eastman and a major prestige beauty house and will help drive the increased use of recycled and/or recyclable plastics in luxury cosmetics packaging.', '*The recycled content is achieved by allocating the recycled waste plastic to Eastman Renew resins using a mass-balance process certified by ISCC.', '“', 'We are proud to partner with The Estée Lauder Companies to help them achieve their ambitious sustainability goals.', 'Together, we can provide a shining example of what is possible today—not years in the future—to advance the circular economy.', '“', 'SCOTT BALLARD Division President of Plastics, Eastman', '93', ' SUSTAINABILITY PACKAGING', 'PRODUCT TAKEBACK PROGRAMS We work with our brands to develop takeback programs, where possible.', 'These programs are subject to local recycling laws and waste jurisdiction and are highly complex in nature.', 'BACK-TO-M·A·C More than 30 years ago, M·A·C created Back-to-M·A·C— a pioneering takeback program intended to help reduce the environmental impact of the brand’s packaging by recycling or recovering its iconic black (ABS) plastic packages where possible.', 'In locations where M·A·C has established its takeback program*, consumers return their clean, empty products to a participating M·A·C counter to be recycled; what cannot be recycled is converted into energy.', 'In regions like North America and EMEA, the brand partners with select vendors to help recover and recycle consumers’ clean, empty M·A·C product packaging.', 'In EMEA, our vendor can recycle select ABS plastic into new plastic that is used in the production of items including coffee machines and IT equipment.', 'In North America, our vendors support M·A·C with a closed loop system to recycle select ABS packaging into material that can be used for new compacts.', 'In North America, M·A·C has enabled the processing of more than 420,000 pounds of empty packages in fiscal 2021.', 'AVEDA FULL CIRCLE While a majority of Aveda products are recyclable at home, a handful of items—pumps, pouches, pots, small bottles (less than 150 ml), samples, tubes, and makeup— are not.', 'In fiscal 2021, Aveda launched its Full Circle Takeback Program in the United Kingdom and select markets in Europe.', 'This takeback program targets packaging that is not typically recyclable at curbside or through municipal recycling programs.', 'Consumers receive either points in Aveda’s loyalty program or discounts for each eligible product returned.', 'Aveda collects the empties and passes them along to its recycling partner.', 'The recycling partner recycles what they can, with any remaining materials being converted to energy.', '94', '*At participating M·A·C counters in select markets, excluding California.', 'SUSTAINABILITY PACKAGING', 'PARTNERING FOR ADVANCED SOLUTIONS We maintain a strong network of collaborators—companies, universities, and consortiums—to help further our collective approach to more responsible packaging.', 'For example, in fiscal 2021, students from Georgia Tech University produced a white paper comparing plastics used for mascara wands.', 'They have continued to conduct life-cycle analyses of the studied plastics in order to help us better understand the impacts of different materials.', 'WE ARE MEMBERS OF AND/OR PARTNERS WITH THE FOLLOWING ORGANIZATIONS: SUSTAINABLE

our consumers while conserving earth’s natural resources.', '95', 'COLLABORATING TO TACKLE DIFFICULT CHALLENGES Packaging tubes are often made of multiple layers of different materials.', 'Currently, there is no infrastructure in practice and at scale to recycle packages that use multiple materials.', 'As a member of Stina (formerly More Recycling), we engage with other member organizations to develop ways to advance recycling of packaging tubes.', 'Stina is a nonprofit organization that provides programs and tools to help accelerate the transition to a society that uses resources responsibly.', 'As a result of this collaboration, Aveda is developing plans to launch “recyclable ready” tubes.', '* These tubes will be made with one single material and developed in accordance with common recycling guidelines to facilitate more widespread recyclability.', '*Aveda tubes smaller than 38.5 mm in diameter will not be recyclable ready due to their size.', 'Check locally to see if
