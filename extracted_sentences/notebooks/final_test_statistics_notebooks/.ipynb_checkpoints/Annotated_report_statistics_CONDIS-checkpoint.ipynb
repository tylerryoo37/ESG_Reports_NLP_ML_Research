or other proceedings.', 'An example of current regulatory impact is the European Unionâs Single-Use Plastics (SUP) Directive.', 'As part of this directive, as of July 2021, the EU no longer allows certain single-use plastic items, such as plastic cutlery and straws, to be placed on the Member States market.', 'Specialist corporate and cross-functional teams on packaging are well established in the Company to identify and develop strategies to respond to such risks.', 'As a result of the SUP directive as it relates to single-use plastic items, McDonaldâs in EU Member States â which include, among others, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Portugal, Spain and The Netherlands â met this legislation with the removal or replacement of plastic straws, stirrers, balloon sticks, cutlery and some locally sourced plates as of Q1 2021.', 'Emerging Regulatory Risks Emerging laws and regulations are assessed regularly with feedback shared via the Government Relations team.', 'Specialist corporate teams exist within the Company that also identify actual or perceived risks relating to emerging regulation in areas such as climate, packaging and energy to support the development of mitigation strategies.', 'One example of a considered climaterelated risk is that of emerging carbon pricing regulation and the potential financial impact on restaurants operating in jurisdictions where carbon tax schemes are proposed for implementation, and the potential increase in raw material costs associated with production in jurisdictions where carbon pricing systems may be implemented by national governments.', 'Additionally, in the EU, the Government Relations team is actively monitoring and assessing the potential effect of the 2030 Climate Target Plan, the strategy on measures to increase the EUâs 2030 target for GHG emissions to at least 55% below 1990 levels to better achieve climate neutrality by 2030.', 'The team is also evaluating Farm to Fork, the EUâs sustainable food blueprint and a major component of the Green Deal, which includes an action plan with 27 measures aimed at greener food production, healthier and more sustainable diets and less food waste, among other emerging regulations.', 'Climate Risk & Resiliency Summary 2021', '12', ' Introduction', 'Governance', 'Strategy', 'Risk Management', 'Technology Risks Technology solutions and associated risks are evaluated as part of both restaurant and supply chain sustainability programs.', 'Our long-term business objectives depend on the successful Systemwide execution of our strategies.', 'We continue to build upon our investments in technology and modernization in order to transform the customer experience.', 'For Company-operated restaurants, this can include the substitution of existing products and services with lower emissions options, including but not limited to renewable energy, packaging or restaurant equipment.', 'If these initiatives are not well executed, or if we do not fully realize the intended benefits of these significant investments, our business results may suffer.', 'Legal Risks Our regulatory and legal environment worldwide exposes us to complex compliance, litigation and similar risks, including growing climate-related risks.', 'Many of our markets are subject to increasing, conflicting and highly prescriptive regulations involving, among other matters, product packaging, the safety of our food and other products, labeling and other disclosure practices.', 'Compliance efforts with those regulations may be affected by ordinary variations in food preparation among our own restaurants and the need to rely on the accuracy and completeness of information from third-party suppliers.', 'Our success depends in part on our ability to manage the impact of regulations and other initiatives that can affect our business plans and operations, and it has increased our costs of doing business and exposure to litigation, governmental investigations or other proceedings.', 'As such, legal compliance is assessed regularly across local laws to ensure our Company is in line with all applicable laws and obligations.', 'Metrics & Targets', 'Market Risks We regularly assess fluctuations in commodity markets in partnership with suppliers across different geographies to monitor raw material availability.', 'For example, the Company utilizes public commodity reporting to assess anticipated fluctuations in commodities that may impact future prices or assured supply.', 'Beyond direct crop impact, extreme weather incidents may impact manufacturing facilities, causing unplanned downtime and resulting pressure on pricing and/or supply.', 'We also monitor trends in consumer preferences and regulatory developments that may impact markets in relation to climate action to implement appropriate mitigation controls and minimize the impact on operations.', 'Reputational Risks Climate change and other environmental factors are included in the criteria we evaluate regularly for customer and external stakeholder feedback.', 'The Company conducts consumer and stakeholder surveys, interviews and stakeholder engagements that allow us to understand expectations and gauge reputation within the context of the food and beverage industry, as well as among corporate sustainability leaders.', 'These insights inform our communications and engagement on sustainability topics and are considered in our sustainability strategies including Climate Action, Forests, Responsible Sourcing, Sustainable Agriculture & Beef and Packaging & Waste, which are intended to demonstrate to customers, as well as internal and external stakeholders, that the Company understands the interconnectivity of environment, social and economic business drivers.', 'For example, Packaging & Waste has emerged as a top environmental concern for customers from recent multi-market customer research, which reinforces our work in this area as a priority for the Company.', 'Management Process Our Sustainability team partners closely with Global Finance to determine potential financial impacts to the Company and its Franchisees.', 'Climate, forests, water and other natural resourcerelated risks are assessed based on both breadth as well as depth of impact to the McDonaldâs System.', 'Each is measured distinctly depending on the topic, but may include impact on factors such as sales, price stability, competitive advantage, restaurants and Franchisees, customers and communities, supply chain commodities, suppliers, and producers and farmers.', 'Assessment of a riskâs substantive impact may include magnitude, duration and/or dependency.', 'We also assess impact based on existing crisis preparedness or the ability to develop such crisis preparedness, contingency and resiliency plans, and expressed external stakeholder concern or inquiry.', 'Identification, assessment and management of risk in our supply chain is overseen by the VP and Risk Management and Advisory Services, who reports directly to the Chief Supply Chain Officer.', 'This VP role is supported by a team of colleagues to lead the design, development and implementation of a comprehensive risk management strategy for our supply chain organization around the world.', 'They regularly assess supply chain

conclusion of an audit where it has been determined that corrective action is required, a Corrective Action Plan (CAP) is created and concerns are discussed by the auditors with factory management.',

months of the prior audit.', 'We expect that continuous improvement is verified during the re-audit.', 'Our general goal is that each reaudit demonstrates measurable improvement from the prior

address and resolve shortcomings in their operations, under extreme circumstances, we may conclude that our merchandise can no longer be produced in certain factories, or that they will be precluded from producing goods for us until they demonstrate that they have addressed the situation and have put management systems in place to prevent a recurrence.', 'Our preferred approach, however, is to work with vendors whenever possible to address and resolve issues identified during audits because improving working conditions in factories in underdeveloped countries is an ongoing effort and TJX, like other retailers, continues to face this challenge.', 'We believe this is preferable to ceasing use of these factories as it gives us the ability to influence positive change.', 'We believe that

third-party waste audits at a select number of stores and DCs to understand where we may have opportunities for increased diversion.', 'We are evaluating potential reduction and diversion programs by performing pilots in stores and DCs to establish a waste roadmap and assist in developing future waste-related goals.', 'THE CIRCULAR ECONOMY As we continue to analyze methods of increasing the recyclability of our materials and products, we are also searching for ways we can participate in the circular economy, like our paint recycling program in Canada.', 'In 2021, we began deploying pallet grinding machines at our U.S. regional distribution centers, which will enable us to transition wood waste into mulch, reusable wood products, or potentially in the future, back into pallets.', 'REUSABLE SHIPPING CRATES To reduce waste from packaging materials, we are working with manufacturers to introduce reusable crates for lawnmowers and windows.', 'These crates will be leased from a third party, who will be responsible for the manufacturing, collection and reuse of these assets, eliminating the previous generation of disposable, non-reusable crates.', 'NEXT FOR WASTE MANAGEMENT STEPS To accomplish our goals of reducing waste sent to landfills, we are investing in new materials with increased recyclability to replace current, difficult-torecycle materials.', 'We are currently investigating ways of recycling plastic film in the United States, which is traditionally sent to landfills.', 'In Canada, we are testing an artificial intelligence technology for our mixed recycling containers that would help optimize our recycling stream.', 'To reduce the amount of waste that is directed to landfills, we are also taking steps to sort our waste into distinct categories.', 'These better organized waste streams help us identify materials that may have value to others, find markets where we can send these materials and, occasionally, generate additional revenue.', 'To this

experienced together, itâs clearer than ever that, for our team, growing and winning start with care.', '2020 was a year in which our team wanted nothing more than to take care of those around us.', 'As an essential business in Americaâs response to COVID-19, we put our business operations, strategy and capabilities to work doing just that.', 'Taking care of our team, guests and communities is a natural result of the purpose that drives each of us at Targetâto help all families discover the joy of everyday life.', 'Guided by our values of inclusivity, connection and drive, this team steps up each and every day to make everyday life better for all.', 'Stepping Up Starts With Team Today, millions of families are turning to Target like never before.', 'As a result, weâre growing rapidly and delivering incredibly strong business results.', 'Weâve built enduring trust with our guests throughout the pandemic, in large part because of the investments weâve made for several yearsâin our stores, in technology, in same-day fulfillment services and supply chain innovation, and, most importantly, in our team.', 'These investments were intended to make Target the easiest place to shop.', 'As the pandemic unfolded, they also made Target the safest shopping experience for our team and guests.', 'Our team is the key factor in our continuing success.', 'The aspiration to serve all families starts with the family of 350,000 team members who gather every day to serve our guests and communities.', 'In 2020, we dedicated well over', 'a billion additional dollars to our teamâs safety and well-being, as youâll see detailed in this report.', 'And weâre going to keep investing in our teamâthrough access to opportunity; to training, development and equitable career advancement; to a culture where everyone can care, grow and win together; and to a $15 starting wage that led our industry and is well above the national minimum.', 'An Equitable and Regenerative Future', 'Confidence Comes From Our Team', 'After many months of global and social crisis, weâre more certain than ever that we can put Targetâs unique business strengths, our size and scale, purpose and values to work for all families.', 'As I look to the future, I couldnât be more confident in the contributions Target will continue to make.', 'And I couldnât be more grateful for our team.', 'Addressing Racial Inequity', 'Early this summer, we introduced Target Forward, the newest chapter in our enterprise sustainability strategy.', 'Target Forward builds on our decades of corporate responsibility and sustainable practices in a way that will influence every corner of our business and deepen our collaboration with community and business partners.', 'The significant commitments weâve made to racial equity also started with our team.', 'Our focused diversity, equity and inclusion (DE&I) strategy dates back a decade and a half.', 'We publicly release ambitious DE&I goals on a regular basis, against which weâve made good progress.', 'And last year we created our Racial Equity Action and Change (REACH) Committee to further accelerate progress for Black team members, guests and communities.', 'Initiatives created by REACH, like our pledge to increase representation of Black team members across our team by 20% in the next three years, are attempts to dismantle systemic inequities.', 'Other initiatives, like our full-team anti-racism trainings and immersions, are intended to support empathy, acumen and effective action for everyone at Target.', 'As youâll see in the pages ahead, the actions weâve taken to advance racial equity outside our company are also very substantial, and theyâre designed to have a lasting positive impact well beyond our core business.', 'They include our plan to spend $2 billion with Black-owned businesses by 2025, the creation of our Scholars Program in partnership with historically Black colleges and universities (HBCUs), and cofounding the OneTen coalition to hire, train and advance a million Black Americans without college degrees, to name a few.', 'And weâre not standing still.', 'In fact, weâre boldly organizing to help address global challenges and drive better outcomes for all people and the planet.', 'Each and every day, they come to work for all families.', 'They care.', 'They anticipate.', 'They adjust in any environment to keep delivering for our guests.', 'And in doing so they keep our business, our ambitions and our impact growingâmoving our company and all of our stakeholders forward toward brighter days.', 'Our ultimate goal is to co-create an equitable and regenerative future for all.', 'And to do that weâve organized our efforts around three key ambitions: designing and elevating sustainable brands; innovating to eliminate waste; and accelerating opportunity and equity.', 'Through Target Forward weâve articulated new goals, with transparent public measurements, and accelerated our progress on goals weâd already announced.', 'For instance, weâre committing to moving faster toward net zero emissions, which weâll now achieve by 2040.', 'As weâve seen for years, sustainability builds resiliency in our operating model and fuels growth and innovation.', 'So this is work thatâs important not just to our team and guests, our

another challenging year?', 'What makes me proud to work at Target is our deeply human approach to our business.', 'Thatâs always been true of this company.', 'And thatâs what guided us in 2020 as we worked to keep our guests and team members safe during the pandemic, use the power of our brand to address the effects of systemic racism and build a sustainability plan thatâs integrated into every area of our business.', 'You can see this in a number of ways: The $1 billion we invested in the health, safety and well-being of our team last yearâincluding accelerating our move to raise our minimum starting wage to $15 an hour, as well as adding new mental health and child-care benefits â¢ The financial and pro bono support we provided for Black, Indigenous and people of color (BIPOC) communities in the wake of the murder of George Floyd â¢ And how weâve continued to use Targetâs historic strength in great design to elevate our efforts in areas like sustainability and inclusionâwith stores, products and experiences that limit Targetâs impact on our environment and ensure that all guests feel welcomed, represented and respected when they engage with our brand.', 'â¢', 'Target is a big company, but weâre incredibly agile and responsive, and weâre committed to using our size and scale to make a difference for our team members, our guests and our communities.', 'What are the most important changes to sustainability at Target to come out of the last year?', 'At the highest level, I think one of the most important things weâve done over the last year is continue to create a culture where our values guide our actions.', 'Thatâs so important in corporate responsibility because when your strategy and tactics are consistent with what you are as a company, itâs much easier to embed that work into every area of your business.', 'For instance, weâve made sustainability a key pillar in Targetâs strategic roadmap.', 'And our new sustainability strategy, Target Forward, reflects that enterprise-wide commitment.', 'Focused on designing and elevating sustainable brands, innovating to eliminate waste, and accelerating opportunity and equity, Target Forward isnât owned by a single team, itâs owned by every team at Target.', 'Another example of this is the REACH Committee.', 'Target has a long-standing commitment to DE&I.', 'But in creating REACH, with leaders drawn from across the company, weâve been able to accelerate our efforts to dismantle the effects of systemic racism through initiatives focused on supporting our team, our business partners and our communities.', 'What are you excited about as the new sustainability strategy launches?', 'I believe a company can only make transformative progress when it measures performance.', 'Our new strategic framework has measurable goals thatâll inspire our teams across the enterprise and offer a clear foundation', 'for their work.', 'The Target Forward strategy will also showcase our bold ambitions for the future and offer greater transparency for our stakeholder groups.', 'Iâm also excited about the holistic way that the environmental, social and ethical pillars of sustainability are being integrated into our business.', 'That connection to the business is vital to keeping our work relevant with team members, communities and stakeholders.', 'And the success of our work is ultimately vital to Targetâs long-term success.', 'What have been the key challenges of the last year?', 'Iâve been so grateful for the Target team.', 'Their humility, their agility and their passion for their work has inspired me so many times over the last year.', 'Our team has shown a commitment to listening, building trust and living our values of inclusivity, connection and drive.', 'This has always been a part of what makes Target special, but in the face of historic challenges, our values have come through like never before.', 'For all of us, Iâll say that we know the issues weâre working on are too big to tackle alone and that success wonât happen overnight.', 'But being curious and open to new ideas makes us better.', 'Weâve come so far over the last year.', 'Weâve set bold goals, weâve pushed ourselves and weâve made incredible progress toward our sustainability ambitions.', 'We should celebrate thatâand be

data on actual consumption of direct emission sources is limited.', 'An estimation is applied to derive the scope 1 emissions, based on the 2019 Global Status Report for Buildings and Construction prepared by the International Energy Agency (IEA).', 'â¢ Scope 2 emissions are the indirect GHG emissions from the generation of purchased electricity, steam, heat or cooling consumed.', 'Energy-indirect emissions are accounted for both location-based and market-based emissions.', 'To calculate the total scope 2 emissions of our facilities, we estimate the electricity consumption for facilities for which no consumption data is available.', 'We estimate the electricity consumption based on occupancy rate, operational surface area, heating degree days and cooling degree days and the average electricity consumption from the facilities for which consumption data is available.', 'BOOKING HOLDINGS / 2021 SUSTAINABILITY REPORT', 'â¢ Scope 3 emissions are all other indirect GHG emissions generated within our supply chain, including both upstream and downstream emissions.', 'Per SBTi guidelines for a 1.5Â°C future, we included three of the GHG Protocol Scope 3 categories that have a total share of over 66.67%.', 'This includes: Purchased Goods and Services, Business Travel and Employee Commuting.', 'Third-party travel provider partner emissions are not included in scope 3.', 'To calculate our employee commuting footprint, we used the averagedata-method, which involves estimating emissions from employee commuting based on average national data on commuting patterns.', 'We did these calculations for 80% of travel and extrapolated the rest.', 'â¢ To calculate the emissions of our largest supplier, we made use of the supplier-specific method, meaning we collected allocated scope 1 and 2 emissions directly from the supplier.', 'For all other purchased goods and services, we used the spend-based method, which estimates emissions for goods and services by collecting data on the economic value of goods and services purchased and multiplying it by relevant industry average emission factors (average emissions per monetary value of goods).', 'For 2021, we extrapolated the 2019 and 2020 analysis to the Booking.com uncategorized spend for 2021.', 'We then extrapolated this to the rest of the company.', 'â¢ For a number of data centers, electricity usage

are fundamentally flawed.', 'To achieve acutely-needed change, ESG needs to evolve to measure realworld Impact.', 'Current environmental, social and governance (ESG) reporting does not measure the scope of positive impact on the world.', 'Instead, it focuses on measuring the dollar value of risk / return.', 'We need to create a system that measures and scrutinizes actual positive impact on our planet, so unsuspecting individual investors can choose to support companies that can make and prioritize positive change.', 'Individual investors â who entrust their money to ESG funds of large investment institutions â are perhaps unaware that their money can be used to buy shares of companies that make climate change worse, not better.', 'On the product front, companies should be required to use real-world data wherever remotely feasible and make it clear when estimates are provided instead of real-world figures.', 'An example of this is vehicle âuse-phaseâ emissions, accounting for the vast majority of lifecycle emissions.', \"Automakers' estimates on lifetime vehicle mileage and lifetime fuel consumption vary dramatically and almost never reflect real-world data.\", 'Automakers often have access to this data, but they donât disclose it.', 'An obvious example of this is measuring the impact of the automotive industry.', 'One might think that the more electric vehicles an automaker sells, as a percentage of total volumes, the better its ESG score.', 'However, this is not the case.', 'As long as a company continues to slightly decrease emissions of its manufacturing operations while churning out gas-guzzlers, its ESG ratings are likely to go up.', 'Vehicle use-phase emissions, which represent 80-90% of total automotive emissions (included in Scope 3 of ESG reporting), tend to be misreported due to the use of unrealistic assumptions or not reported at all.', 'Itâs easy to see why some oil & gas companies rank higher than Tesla on âEnvironmental Impact.â', 'âThe most striking feature of the [ESG rating] system is how rarely a companyâs record on climate change seems to get in the way of its climb up the ESG ladderâor even to factor at all.â ESG Mirage: Bloomberg Businessweek', '2', 'When it comes to a companyâs employees, it is essential that theyâre treated well, with a system in place to prevent discrimination of any kind, that they have a safe workplace and that they are rewarded appropriately, with significant upside if their employer does well.', 'Many ESG ratings evaluate: âDoes this ESG issue impact the profitability of the company?â We need a system that evaluates: âDoes the growth of this company have a positive impact on the world?â This evolution of ESG needs to be championed by institutional investors, rating agencies, public companies and the general public.', 'As the world needs to strive for a substantial positive impact, we wonât be referring to ESG in

to continue increasing our production volumes and the accessibility of our products.', 'In more concrete terms, this means that by 2030 we are aiming to sell 20 million electric vehicles per year (compared to 0.94 million in 2021) and deploy 1,500 GWh of energy storage per year (compared to 4 GWh in 2021).', 'If we were to achieve such a vehicle delivery milestone through a consistent growth rate, the total Tesla vehicle fleet would surpass tens of millions of vehicles by 2030, and each of those vehicles could save tons of CO2e emissions every year of usage.', 'Furthermore, each product we make must be continuously improved at each step of its lifecycle: from manufacturing to consumer use to recycling.', 'We must also improve every metric, including the energy and water used to make our products, how safe our customers and employees are and the affordability and accessibility of our products.', 'Each of these themes will be covered in this yearâs Impact Report.', '7', ' Making

and oversees the management of Teslaâs business â including reviewing the effectiveness of Teslaâs Impact priorities, initiatives and programs and this report.', 'With those responsibilities in mind, the Board sets high standards for Tesla and its employees, officers and directors; and we periodically add new, highly qualified independent directors to the Board, such as Larry Ellison and Kathleen Wilson-Thompson in 2018 and Hiromichi Mizuno in 2020.', 'Implicit in this approach is the importance of sound corporate governance.', '11', ' Corporate Governance Introduction', 'Sound corporate governance is critical to our mission.', 'We are committed to establishing an operating framework that exercises appropriate oversight of responsibilities at all levels throughout the company and manages its affairs consistent with high principles of business ethics.', 'Tesla aspires to be a âdo the right thingâ company.', 'Our Code of Business Ethics sets out basic principles that should help anyone working at or for Tesla avoid even the appearance of improper behavior.', 'Teslaâs Code of Business Ethics and our Corporate Governance Guidelines are available on Teslaâs website.', 'In addition, we believe in regular and transparent communication with employees.', 'We encourage Tesla employees to share their feedback openly (and anonymously, if they prefer), and provide easy methods to do so.', 'We also regularly conduct employee surveys to identify strengths and opportunities for improvement.', 'We have a robust action planning process to ensure we proactively address the concerns or feedback.', 'We also have a whistleblower hotline through which employees can report concerns at any time.', 'Tesla keeps information reported by employees in confidence, whether through the hotline or another channel.', 'Our policies prohibit retaliatory actions against employees for raising concerns or making complaints.', 'We are committed to maintaining an open and transparent culture where it is safe and acceptable for all employees to raise concerns about policy violations by their manager or colleagues or about the workplace overall.', '12', ' Corporate Governance Our Approach', 'Our unique business requires a unique approach to corporate governance.', 'And our mission requires a long-term focus that we believe will ultimately maximize value to our employees and our stockholders.', 'Our corporate governance structure has facilitated several key decisions which might have appeared counter-intuitive to some, but which have set up the Tesla to achieve long-term success.', 'Some examples include our decisions to: â¢', 'Manufacture all-electric vehicles (EVs) from the ground up rather than being a mere supplier of EV components', 'â¢', 'Establish an international network of our own stores, service centers and Supercharger stations despite regulatory hurdles and the significant capital outlay required to do so', 'â¢', 'Build Gigafactory 1, the largest lithium-ion battery factory in the world, so that we can scale most effectively', 'â¢', 'Expand into energy generation and storage through the acquisition of SolarCity Corporation in 2016 to create a vertically integrated sustainable energy company and empower individual consumers to be their own utility', 'â¢', 'Deploy FSD city streets beta software to our fleet to develop complete Full Self-Driving capability in the future', 'â¢', 'Compensate our CEO only if other shareholders realize tremendous value', 'These and other similar decisions were made due to our corporate governance structure and, ultimately, decisions like these are what differentiate Tesla from other companies and are a significant reason why the annualized stockholder return since our 2010 IPO until December 31, 2021 equaled 65%.', 'At the same time, the Board continuously evaluates our corporate governance structure, practices and policies, and weighs stakeholder feedback including proposals we have historically received at our annual meetings.', 'For example, at our 2021 annual meeting of stockholders, the Board proposed and recommended that stockholders adopt an amendment to our certificate of incorporation to reduce the term of our directors to two years.', 'However, our stockholders did not approve that proposal.', 'The Board is directly and regularly

startup origins.', 'We emphasize structuring compensation to reward our named executive officers based on performance, and equity awards weigh heavily in our named executive officersâ total compensation, including awards that vest upon the achievement of clear and measurable milestones.', 'Since these awards increase in value as our stock price increases (and in the case of stock option awards, have no value unless our stock price increases following their grant), our named executive officersâ incentives are closely aligned with the long-term interests of our stockholders.', 'Tesla has no cash bonus program for any of our named executive officers and generally does not provide any perquisites or tax reimbursements to our named executive officers that are not available to other employees.', 'No named executive officer has any severance or change of control arrangement, except as reflected in Elon Muskâs performance-based 2018 CEO Performance Award.', 'A change in control modifies the vesting requirements of the 2018 CEO Performance Award such that vesting of the Awardâs tranches would be measured based on Teslaâs market capitalization at the time of the change of the control, without regard to the operational milestones of the Award.', 'Elon Musk, our Chief Executive Officer, historically earned a base salary that reflected the applicable minimum wage requirements under California law, and he was subject to income taxes based on such base salary.', 'However, he has never accepted his salary.', 'Commencing in May 2019 at Mr. Muskâs request, we eliminated altogether the earning and accrual of this base salary.', 'Consequently, 100% of Mr. Muskâs compensation is at-risk.', 'Similarly, the compensation program for Teslaâs non-employee directors is designed to be consistent with our compensation philosophy for our employees, with an emphasis on equity-based compensation over cash in order to align the value of their compensation with the market value of our stock, and consequently, with the long-term interests of our stockholders.', 'Moreover, while we offer to our general employee population restricted stock units that will retain some value even if the market value of our stock decreases, the equity-based compensation to our directors has been exclusively in the form of stock options, which have zero initial value and accumulate value, if at all, only to the extent that our stock price increases following their grant, through the applicable vesting dates and until such stock options are ultimately exercised and the underlying shares are sold.', 'The remaining portion of our directorsâ compensation has been comprised of cash retainer payments that are relatively modest compared to peer companies and that may be waived at the election of each director.', 'Further, in June 2021, the Board adopted a resolution that all existing directors forego any automatic grants of annual stock option awards under our director compensation policy until July 2022 unless the Board determines otherwise.', '16', ' Corporate Governance Data Privacy and Cybersecurity', 'Tesla builds products with privacy and security at

substantial increases in manufacturing scrap globally.', 'We intend to tailor recycling solutions to each location and thereby re-introduce valuable materials back into our manufacturing process.', 'Our goal is to develop a safe recycling process with high recovery rates, low costs and low environmental impact.', 'From an economic perspective, we expect to recognize significant savings over the long term as the costs associated with large-scale battery material recovery and recycling will be far lower than purchasing additional raw materials for cell manufacturing.', 'Supply Chain Alignment with Best Practices', 'We have high expectations for our suppliers Tesla is committed to ensuring that our suppliers operate responsibly.', 'We do this by proactively identifying and addressing potential risks in our supply chains.', 'The Tesla Supplier Code of Conduct, Human Rights Policy and Responsible Materials Policy outline Teslaâs expectations for suppliers.', 'We established a responsible sourcing program based on international best practices Our responsible sourcing program is based on the OECD Due Diligence Guidance for Responsible Mineral Supply Chains.', 'Tesla collects

'98', ' Battery Supply Chain #1 The Tesla Approach', 'Prioritization of cobalt, lithium and nickel Given their unique significance to the success of EVs and energy storage, Tesla has a dedicated responsible sourcing program for three priority minerals in the battery supply chain: cobalt, nickel and lithium.', 'We prioritize these raw materials for the following reasons: 1.', 'Commercial importance: Cobalt, lithium and nickel are the key raw materials used in cathode production, represent about a third of the total costs of a battery cell and play an essential function in improving vehicle range and safety performance.', '2.', 'Potential environmental and social impact and scrutiny: Cobalt, lithium and nickel are also âmineralsâ â in that they are raw materials that are produced through different methods of mining around the world, often concentrated in countries that face socio-economic and environmental challenges.', 'As known global reserves are depleted, these minerals are becoming increasingly scarce, and companies look to access resources in more remote and challenging locations to meet global demand.', 'Cobalt, lithium and nickel are also classified as critical minerals by the United States, European Union and Canadian governments because they are essential in enabling a transition away from fossil fuels to a low-carbon economy.', 'As a result, the impact of mining activity on the environment and local communities lends itself to greater environmental and social scrutiny from civil society, policymakers and investors.', 'Mining has an important role to play in the transition to sustainable energy and we engage with suppliers to ensure mining is done in a responsible way.', 'This is one of the reasons Tesla joined the Initiative for Responsible Mining Assurance (IRMA) and uses the IRMA Standard as well as other internationally recognized responsible mining standards in our due diligence.', '99', ' Battery Supply Chain #1 The Tesla Approach', 'The unique Tesla approach: Going directly to the source The implementation of an OECD-aligned approach for cobalt, nickel and lithium is underpinned by the following two pillars: 1.', '>95% Lithium hydroxide sourced directly', '>50% Cobalt sourced directly', '>30% Nickel sourced directly', '100', 'Direct sourcing from mining companies: While cobalt, nickel and lithium go through multiple processing steps by different companies, some of the more important environmental and social risks in this supply chain are present at mine sites.', 'Direct sourcing from mining companies allows Tesla to engage directly in local contexts instead of having to rely on multiple midstream companies that typically sit between EV makers and mining.', 'It also enables more transparent and traceable supply chains and better environmental and social data.', 'In 2021, Tesla procured >95% of lithium hydroxide, >50% of cobalt and >30% of nickel for nickelcontaining (NCA and NCM) cells directly from nine mining and chemicals companies.', 'All nine binding contracts include environmental and social requirements.', 'As Teslaâs battery supply chain continues to scale, Tesla expects the proportion of directly sourced minerals to increase.', '2.', 'Direct local engagement: Building on direct supplier engagement, Tesla seeks to contribute to the continuous improvement of conditions in communities affected by operations in Teslaâs supply chain, informed by engagement with local experts, community organizations and civil society.', 'Battery Supply Chain #1 The Tesla Approach', 'Our diversified cathode strategy Teslaâs batteries today contain a variety of different cathode chemistries, including nickel-cobalt-aluminum (NCA) and nickel-cobalt-manganese (NCM) for higher energy applications and lithium iron phosphate (LFP) for lower energy applications.', 'Tesla will continue to advance a diversified cathode strategy for LFP, nickel-rich and manganese-rich cathodes to address various market segments for vehicle and energy storage products and provide future flexibility based on raw materials availability and pricing.', 'To put this into context, lithium only accounts for roughly 1.5% of the full battery pack weight.', 'Additionally, iron phosphate battery packs contain no cobalt or nickel.', 'While the relative cathode compositions and our overall demand of various minerals and battery-grade chemicals will continue to evolve, Tesla and the global battery supply chain will require significant quantities of responsibly produced lithium, nickel, cobalt, manganese, iron, phosphates and many other minerals for the foreseeable future.', 'While we recognize the critical role battery recycling will play in supplying a portion of these materials to enable a closed loop supply chain, global cell production will continue to rely heavily on primary, mined materials to meet the growing demand in the short to medium term.', 'The availability and affordability of these minerals and chemicals are key to advancing Teslaâs mission and accelerating the transition to sustainable energy.', 'We will continue to collaborate with our suppliers and upstream producers in providing visibility to enable the scale up of key battery minerals.', 'For cells containing NCA and NCM cathodes, we continue to work toward batteries that contain higher levels of nickel in order to improve vehicle range while lowering overall battery costs, without compromising overall cell performance, such as battery safety and lifetime, that is currently enabled by cobalt.', 'It is important to note that we expect our absolute cobalt demand to increase over the coming years because our vehicle and cell production growth rate is forecasted to outpace the overall rate of cobalt reduction on a per cell basis.', 'Nickel-Cobalt-Aluminum Cathode P', '101', 'Nickel-Manganese-Cobalt Cathode', 'Lithium-Iron-Phosphate Cathode', ' Battery Supply Chain #2

our supplier performance evaluation to key environmental and social impact metrics relevant to Teslaâs business.', 'This program extension was introduced at the time when Tesla was transitioning from a small automotive manufacturer to a company gaining recognition as the leader in electrical vehicle production.', 'We recognized that this growth came with an increased ability to impact positive change on the practices of our suppliers, but also with an increased responsibility to drive such change in line with our mission statement.', 'During the program pilot phase, we focused our efforts on suppliers that we deemed high risk based on their industry or the use of potentially dangerous processes and/or chemicals in the manufacturing of our parts.', 'We chose to utilize the Responsible Business Allianceâs (RBA) Validated Assessment Program (VAP) as the basis for our audits.', 'The RBAâs VAP is an audit protocol globally recognized for its breadth of topics and stringent requirements for supplier completion.', 'It covers nearly 200 checkpoints across labor, health and safety, environmental, ethical and management system topics.', 'Audits are conducted by independent third parties that are approved by the RBA, and all auditors must undergo training by the RBA on the audit standard and its implementation ensuring a globally and industry-wide standardized approach.', 'In any case where any priority non-conformance (the most significant type) occurs, our audit procedures require that suppliers undergo a closure audit.', 'These closure audits â which are a follow up to the original audit where the non-conformances were identified â allow suppliers to address all non-conformances in the earlier audits.', 'Additional audits, rather than an immediate suspension of the business relationship, are preferred to improve working conditions and reduce the risk of continued deficiencies.', 'As of the end of 2021, we had a total of 152 supplier locations go through our supplier audit at least once, representing 144 suppliers, or 10% of 2021 spend with our direct supply base.', 'As part of these audits over 4,000 supplier employee interviews were conducted.', '112', ' Responsible Sourcing Supplier Audit Expansion', 'Continuing to expand our audit program In 2021, Tesla redefined its criteria for determining which of our suppliers are subject to the Supplier Audit program.', 'While in its initial stages the suppliers subject to the audit were mainly located in China, and the updated criteria expanded the scope to include significantly more suppliers globally.', 'When we started our audit program, we had only just announced our plans for Gigafactory Shanghai.', 'We now have six factories across three different continents, and our production volume of vehicles has grown exponentially.', 'As our global footprint and manufacturing grew, so did our supply base.', 'Therefore, the expansion of our audit program was an important step to ensure that our supplier due diligence efforts continue to reflect the realities of our supply chain and can properly identify and address potential risks within our supply base.', 'The criteria on which suppliers are selected to undergo the Supplier Audit is based on an expanded risk assessment approach, looking at Teslaâs exposure to suppliers financially, as well as suppliersâ location.', 'This criteria determines which suppliers are obligated to undergo an audit, but additional suppliers can be nominated by our commercial and supplier industrialization teams where they see value in doing so or the potential to further mitigate risk.', 'With the expanded audit program scope, we are targeting to cover over 50% of our global spend with our direct supply base.', 'As part of our program expansion, we are building on our ability to influence supplier behavior in a positive way.', 'When a supplier is not meeting our expectations, they are obligated to implement corrective action plans to remedy any deficiencies or non-conformances found during the audit process, regardless of the severity.', 'In cases of the highest priority non-conformances, suppliers are required to undergo closure audits to ensure that their corrective action plans have been fully implemented.', 'In cases of less severe non-conformances, suppliers are still required to develop and implement corrective action plans as well as provide evidence to Tesla that those plans have been fully implemented within our expected timelines.', 'Furthermore, we defined a separate category called Zero Tolerance Violations, which, for example, include any violations related to the use of forced or child labor and inhumane treatment of workers.', 'In cases where such instances are discovered, our supply chain leadership will be informed, and a corrective action plan will be developed immediately, together with the supplier.', 'Tesla will transition away from the supplier
