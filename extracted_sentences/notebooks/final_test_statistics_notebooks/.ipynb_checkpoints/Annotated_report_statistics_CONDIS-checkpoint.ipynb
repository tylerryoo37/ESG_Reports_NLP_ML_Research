chicken, dairy, cheese, bakery and baked goods, logistics, produce, liquid products and potatoes.', 'It also included the top 80% of our fiber-based packaging and key equipment suppliers and additional selected U.S. suppliers.', 'These suppliers represented 79% of our annual global spend across food, packaging, logistics and equipment in 2020.', 'Use of lower-emission sources of energy', 'Medium term (2–11 years)', 'A primary climate-related opportunity driver for McDonald’s is the procurement of low-cost, clean electricity for the operation of restaurants.', 'This enables the Company and Franchisees to manage risks of increased operational costs due to clean energy policies and regulations in the short term, and enhance the long-term resiliency of our restaurants for the future.', 'For example, in 2020, McDonald’s completed three new virtual power purchase agreement (VPPA) transactions, with two wind farms and one portfolio of solar projects slated to be built in Illinois, Oklahoma, North Carolina and Ohio.', 'Once all the projects initiated in 2019–2021 are online, the energy generated by renewable energy projects is expected to be equivalent to over 8,000 restaurants’ worth of electricity and contribute to a 22% GHG reduction from our 2015 baseline.', 'McDonald’s portion of these renewable energy projects is expected to help prevent approximately 2,300,000 metric tons of CO2e emissions each year.', 'Accelerating sustainable and regenerative farming', 'Medium term (2–11 years)', 'The positive environmental impacts of regenerative agriculture practices, such as improving biodiversity and capturing carbon, are demonstrable.', 'The Company is working on a number of activities with the potential to increase climate resiliency in this area, including but not limited to: • I nvesting in soil and biodiversity in Nebraska, U.S.: With Cargill, The Nature Conservancy and Target, we support regenerative agriculture practices that help mitigate climate change and improve the resiliency of land.', '• Improving grazing techniques in the U.S.: We launched a partnership with the Foundation for Food & Agriculture Research (FFAR) to analyze the impact of Adaptive Multi-Paddock (AMP) grazing practices against continuously grazed ranches.', '• Regenerative grazing in the U.K.: We’re working with FAI Farms on a regenerative grazing system that focuses on how cattle are a vital part of the ecosystem on the farm, contributing to soil biology with the trampling of grass and addition of dung to feed microbes to create more and better soil.', 'Accelerating sustainable and regenerative farming', 'Long term (11–30 years)', 'The majority of our environmental impacts occur beyond our own operations, through the Company’s supply chain, and so McDonald’s journey toward sustainable sourcing begins with our suppliers.', 'Among other activities, the Company is focused on collaborative action and investment to address climate-related risks associated with our agriculture value chain and partnering to advance sustainable and regenerative agriculture practices to help protect our planet for communities today and in the future.', 'Given McDonald’s size and scale, we believe we have an important role to play in responsible sourcing.', 'We approach sustainable agriculture holistically and consider our impact on the planet, the livelihoods of the people who produce our food, the communities in which they live and the well-being of the animals we rely on.', 'We want to create positive impact, such as by boosting resiliency, improving biodiversity, maintaining native grasslands and capturing carbon, and rebuilding soils.', 'We have listed a number of activities in this area with a medium-term time frame, and we fully expect to continue working with farmers and ranchers over the long term on these projects while developing other such opportunities across the world.', 'Climate Risk & Resiliency Summary 2021', '07', ' Introduction', 'Governance', 'Strategy', 'Risk Management', 'Impact on Business, Strategy and Financial Planning McDonald’s corporate and markets assess and plan for the risks and opportunities related to climate change.', 'There are significant investments made to activate our strategies, including opportunities integrated into our financial planning to achieve our science-based target to reduce GHG emissions, or to implement resilience and adaptation plans and other actions to accommodate transitional and physical risks and opportunities.', 'Below are examples of important steps we have taken.', '• W  e have integrated building and equipment efficiency measures, and the associated cost savings (e.g., from energy efficiency) have been identified and incorporated into asset reinvestment plans in the short- to medium-term time horizon.', '• We have set an expectation for all McDonald’s globally managed suppliers to set climate targets, measure emissions and make reductions – particularly in Scope 3 emissions – in line with their broader sustainability strategies.', 'These targets include estimated impacts from land use change.', 'Through our climate data and insights platform, we know which suppliers and foodsourcing categories contribute the most to our emissions, as well as emissions from land use change such as deforestation, allowing us to work with these suppliers to create strategies that support our science-based target and reduce our impact on the climate.', 'As well as target-setting, we have an expectation that suppliers will instigate emissions monitoring and reduction programs, and report progress through the CDP Supply Chain program.', 'This partnership approach will help suppliers understand the impacts of climate change on our businesses – including deforestation – and enable us to tailor supplier-led reduction initiatives that are specific to our supply chain, as well as foster new supplier collaborations to advance our climate mitigation and resilience strategies and achieve an even greater impact.', 'Metrics & Targets', 'Investment in R&D As we decide how and where to pursue and scale innovation pilot programs, such as agricultural research projects or alternative energy technology and energy efficiency projects, we build on prior learnings and anticipate continuous future insights that will inform short-, medium- and long-term future investments in research and development (R&D) based on climate-related risks and opportunities.', 'Many markets are testing energy sourcing and reduction, water saving, and recycling and waste-related innovations.', 'In 2020, McDonald’s unveiled a first-of-its-kind net zero energy-designed restaurant at Walt Disney World Resort in Orlando, Florida.', 'The global flagship restaurant is designed to create enough renewable energy on-site to cover 100% of its annual energy needs, and will serve as a learning hub to test solutions for reducing energy and water use.', 'We take a holistic approach to sustainability, which includes exploring ways to help our customers reduce their own environmental impact.', 'For instance, in some markets, restaurants are offering electric vehicle charging points, whereas other markets are transitioning to more sustainable Happy Meal toys made from recycled, renewable or certified materials.', 'The Company is testing and deploying new packaging solutions in our restaurants globally, to learn how we can reduce packaging and switch to more sustainable materials while still delivering a great experience for our customers.', 'Additionally, the Company has two key commitments on Packaging & Waste: • S  ource 100% of our guest packaging from renewable, recycled or certified sources by 2025.', '• Recycle guest packaging in 100% of McDonald’s restaurants by 2025.', 'We understand that recycling infrastructure, regulations and consumer behaviors vary from city to city and country to country, but we plan to be part of the solution and help influence powerful change.', 'The Company is also engaged in a range of projects and initiatives that focus on impact in our supply chain.', 'For example: • We launched a partnership with the Foundation for Food and Agriculture Research.', 'We also committed to match up to $4.5 million in a research project with The ASU Foundation for A New American University.', 'The research is analyzing the impact of AMP grazing practices, which mimic the natural grazing patterns of wild ruminants against continuously grazed ranches across 10 ranches in the southeastern U.S. • We helped to establish project CAP’2ER in France, an environmental footprint calculator that evaluates the environmental impacts within beef farming, helping to identify where farmers can work to reduce their GHG emissions.', 'To date, more than 20,000 assessments have been carried out, and we have verified that 129,000 hectares of land is being managed to support biodiversity by French beef farmers who we source from.', '• We have developed a Deforestation-Free Beef Procurement Policy in priority countries where we aim to quantify and address the link between identified or projected deforestation and our supply chain.', 'We use satellite imagery of the area along with data analysis to determine whether supplying farms comply with our Deforestation-Free Beef Procurement Policy.', '• McDonald’s is engaged in efforts to halt conversion of ecosystems that host critical biodiversity, including forests, grasslands and savannahs, such as our support of the Instituto Onça-Pintada in Brazil.', 'Apex predators, such as jaguars, are a good indication of a robust and thriving ecosystem.', 'The Certificado Onça-Pintada, or Jaguar Friendly Ranch Certification, by the Instituto

'Operations In cases of extreme weather events, restaurant operations and deliveries have been disrupted in some geographies.', 'As we continue to pursue climate-related scenario modeling going forward, in the short to long term we will continue to assess the materiality of these impacts to the Company and its Franchisees and suppliers.', 'Energy and GHG-reducing technologies and approaches identified as opportunities are being implemented across our restaurants.', 'An example is McDonald’s digital Global Restaurant Building & Equipment Standard (GRBES), which is being rolled out to countries globally through 2021.', 'The GRBES platform is designed to provide building and equipment requirements for new restaurants and guidance on exterior and site LED lighting, energy management, building construction, refrigeration, HVAC, maintenance and servicing, local equipment, recycling bins and water conservation.', 'Our efforts to realize this opportunity are measured as part of our GHG and enterprise-level corporate sustainability tracking system on an annual basis.', 'Resilience of Strategy Reducing emissions and adapting to climate change is critical to the collective success and resilience of the McDonald’s System.', 'While taking action on climate change is challenging and requires significant investment, we believe it will drive business value in the long term by ensuring we are striving to manage operational costs in our energy supply, improve the security of supply of our raw materials and reduce our exposure to increasing environmental risks, regulation and taxes.', 'Based on globally developed and leading climate scenarios, the Company is conducting and analyzing scenario modeling to understand the transition and physical risks and opportunities for the McDonald’s System, including our supply chain, Company offices, and Company-owned and franchised restaurants.', 'The analysis will include the implications of carbon pricing mechanisms and waterrelated risks.', 'In line with our corporate sustainability tracking system, a data analysis platform was developed for assessing the potential impact of carbon taxes and water-related risks across all global locations, and on key commodities and sourcing regions.', 'Metrics & Targets', 'Physical Risk Scenario Analysis To assess physical risk, we chose the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) RCP 8.5 scenario that allows us to assess the implication of acute and chronic water-related risks to McDonald’s restaurants and suppliers in a “business-as-usual” scenario.', 'Our initial physical risk assessment is focused on water stress under the conditions of a rapidly heating planet and covers all Company-owned and franchised restaurants globally and our supply chain, including key agricultural commodities.', 'The time horizon for this scenario analysis is 2030 for restaurants and 2040 for supply chain, selected for its relevance to our organization due to the importance of water for our operations and supply chain, notably agriculture, and allows us to view medium- and long-term risks and opportunities in financial terms.', 'The results of the analysis will help us understand the potential financial impact to our business by: • Scenario; • Time period; • Directional focus in terms of priority locations; and • Commodities where further analysis and refinement is required.', 'Additionally, the results support the identification and scaling of best practices for mitigating such risks to help build a more resilient System.', 'Transition Risk Scenario Analysis To assess transition risk, we chose the Sustainable Development Scenario (SDS) from the World Energy Model of the International Energy Agency (the IEA).', 'In line with TCFD recommendations, we chose the IEA’s SDS model as a recognized and comparable thirdparty scenario that allows us to assess our resilience in a world where global temperatures are limited to well below 2°C.', 'The SDS outlines a major transformation of the global energy system by 2040 and is characterized by widespread adoption of clean energy policies and regulation.', 'Our initial transition risk assessment is focused on emerging regulation on carbon pricing mechanisms, specifically the carbon price exposure to the McDonald’s System in a lowcarbon scenario.', 'Our assessment covers all Company-owned and franchised restaurants globally.', 'We also assessed our key agricultural commodities that represent our main supply chain GHG drivers globally, with the ambition to expand this modeling in the near future.', 'The results of the analysis will help us understand the potential financial impact to our business by scenario and time period and directional focus in terms of priority locations and commodities.', 'Addressing the Largest Elements of Our Footprint Our scenario analysis and risk identification processes provide us with a clearer understanding of the short-, medium- and long-term risks to our business.', 'In collaboration with thousands of Franchisees, suppliers and producers, we use these insights and others from across our business to prioritize action on the largest elements of our carbon footprint.', 'We are also contributing to the development of GHG accounting methods to demonstrate the impact of factors such as preventing land use change and

executed, or if we do not fully realize the intended benefits of these significant investments, our business results may suffer.', 'Legal Risks Our regulatory and legal environment worldwide exposes us to complex compliance, litigation and similar risks, including growing climate-related risks.', 'Many of our markets are subject to increasing, conflicting and highly prescriptive regulations

developments that may impact markets in relation to climate action to implement appropriate mitigation controls and minimize the impact on operations.', 'Reputational Risks Climate change and other environmental factors are included in the criteria we evaluate regularly for customer and external stakeholder feedback.', 'The Company conducts consumer and stakeholder surveys, interviews and stakeholder engagements that allow us to understand expectations and gauge reputation within the context of the food and beverage industry, as well as among corporate sustainability leaders.', 'These insights inform our communications and engagement on sustainability topics and are considered in our sustainability strategies including Climate Action, Forests, Responsible Sourcing, Sustainable Agriculture & Beef and Packaging & Waste, which are intended to demonstrate to customers, as well as internal and external stakeholders, that the Company understands the interconnectivity of environment, social and economic business drivers.', 'For example, Packaging & Waste has emerged as a top environmental concern for customers from recent multi-market customer research, which reinforces our work in this area as a priority for the Company.', 'Management Process Our Sustainability team partners closely with Global Finance to determine potential financial impacts to the Company and its Franchisees.', 'Climate, forests, water and other natural resourcerelated risks are assessed based on both breadth as well as depth of impact to the McDonald’s System.', 'Each is measured distinctly depending on the topic, but may include impact on factors such as sales, price stability, competitive advantage, restaurants and Franchisees, customers and communities, supply chain commodities, suppliers, and producers and farmers.', 'Assessment of a risk’s substantive impact may include magnitude, duration and/or dependency.', 'We also assess impact based on existing crisis preparedness or the ability to develop such crisis preparedness, contingency and resiliency plans, and expressed external stakeholder concern or inquiry.', 'Identification, assessment and management of risk in our supply chain is overseen by the VP and Risk Management and Advisory Services, who reports directly to the Chief Supply Chain Officer.', 'This VP role is supported by a team

been determined that corrective action is required, a Corrective Action Plan (CAP) is created and concerns are discussed by the auditors with factory management.', 'A copy of the CAP is provided to

operations, under extreme circumstances, we may conclude that our merchandise can no longer be produced in certain factories, or that they will be precluded from producing goods for us until they demonstrate that they have addressed the situation and have put management systems in place to prevent a recurrence.', 'Our preferred approach, however, is to work with vendors whenever possible to address and resolve issues identified during audits because improving working conditions in factories in underdeveloped countries is an ongoing effort and TJX, like other retailers, continues to face this challenge.', 'We believe this is preferable to ceasing use of these factories as it gives us the ability to influence positive change.', 'We believe that this “continuous improvement” model is in

into a new city hall.', 'As I watched our associates and neighbors come together to build and strengthen a community so close to my heart, I was filled with an immense amount of pride for the way our company has made homes—and hometowns—better for those in need.', 'Brownsville’s new city hall is one of 100 community spaces across the country we revitalized as part of our centennial celebration.', 'These 100 Hometowns projects benefited more than 1.3 million people, yet only represent a fraction of the many lives our Lowe’s associates impact each year.', 'It’s humbling to reflect on how our company has grown in our first 100 years, and even more humbling to reflect on what we could accomplish in the next century.', 'Now more than ever, as we build what’s next, we’re committed to sustainability—of our people, our communities, our products and our operations.', 'Despite the persistent global challenges of the last two years, our associates delivered over $96 billion in sales and spent more than 300,000 hours volunteering in local communities.', 'In recognition of their tremendous work, we awarded $740 million in bonuses to our front-line associates.', 'Beyond financial recognition, we continued to focus on creating a culture that understands and values diverse perspectives.', 'We now offer eight Business Resource Groups to foster an inclusive culture where our

a deep sense of responsibility to protect the planet we all share.', 'Across our operations, we reduced absolute Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions by 42% over the past five years and achieved an 11% reduction in total energy consumption from 2020 to 2021.', 'For the third consecutive year, Lowe’s was included on the Dow Jones Sustainability Index for North America based on our sustainability, environmental and governance practices.', 'In the coming year, we will further our commitment with a science-based net-zero target to help inspire and guide our industry toward a low-carbon future.', 'The new target will include near and long-term greenhouse gas emissions reduction goals for Lowe’s full value chain, including Scopes 1, 2 and 3.', 'We’re also helping customers live more sustainably at home and reduce their environmental impact.', 'Our customers will see $17.7 billion in lifetime water and energy bill savings from the ENERGY STAR® and WaterSense® products they purchased from Lowe’s in 2021, and we’re developing buying guides to embed sustainability criteria into our product decisions.', 'We hold vendors to high standards for ethical business practices, human rights and environmental stewardship, as evidenced in our Human Rights Policy and Vendor Code of Conduct.', 'I firmly believe that it is not possible for a company to be great unless it is also a great corporate citizen.', 'Within this report, you’ll learn more about our commitments and progress to address the issues most important to our people and our planet.', 'We could not have achieved 100 years in

improving security and streamlining processes wherever possible.', 'We also participate in various privacy and retail industry groups to remain at the forefront of regulatory and policy trends and best practices, and to provide input to various privacy legislative initiatives.', \"We actively participate in and contribute to the Retail Industry Leaders Association’s Privacy Leaders Council, the National Retail Federation’s Privacy Working Group and other state privacy leaders' working groups.\", 'We continue to invest in our privacy talent by enabling and encouraging associates on our privacy team to pursue professional training and certification, including the Certified Information Privacy Professional designation.', '45', ' 2021 CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT', 'CEO LETTER', 'OVERVIEW', 'HIGHLIGHTS', 'OUR PEOPLE & OUR COMMUNITIES', 'PRODUCT SUSTAINABILITY', 'OPERATIONAL EXCELLENCE', 'INDICES', 'BUSINESS RESILIENCE Lowe’s takes a long-term approach to resiliency, focused on climate change, policy making and disaster preparation through continuity plans.', 'These interwoven issues are complex and require ongoing and constantly adapting management approaches.', 'Enterprise risk management (ERM) is integral to the strategic management of our company and is overseen by the audit committee of the Board of Directors.', 'BUSINESS CONTINUITY Our business resilience and continuity plans emphasize people, places and processes.', 'We currently have over 200 continuity plans in place and are continuing to add new ones annually.', 'In 2021, we started developing continuity plans for our operations in India and Canada and stress testing plans already in place.', 'We use continuity plans to improve our accessibility to customers and aid our associates in times of disruption.', 'In 2021, we also created continuity checklists for new director-level associates in relevant roles.', 'Developed in collaboration with Lowe’s University, these checklists explain each director’s role in terms of Lowe’s overall continuity plans, helping to streamline the transition of responsibilities, in addition to documenting and coordinating continuity planning.', 'GLOBAL SECURITY OPERATIONS CENTER In October 2020, we launched the Global Security Operations Center (GSOC) with the mission of protecting all Lowe’s associates, customers and assets through a centralized approach to the timely collection, analysis and dissemination of essential security information.', 'The GSOC leverages an Everbridge visual command center to communicate potential external threats to relevant stakeholders across the organization 24/7/365.', 'In addition to security operations, the GSOC intelligence team focuses on strategic threat intelligence operations, scanning the horizon for potential impacts from possible targeted activism, civil unrest, geopolitical issues, potential reputation impact and other threats, to provide a common threat picture.', 'THE NEXT 100 YEARS', 'In 2021, the GSOC conducted a pilot to expand its scope to include physical security incidents at our store locations.', 'This program was initially piloted in five United States store districts in September 2021 and two additional districts were added in December 2021, with plans to roll out to multiple regions in 2022 and beyond.', 'To better understand the needs of our district asset protection managers, in 2021, we administered a survey requesting feedback on the effectiveness and timeliness of GSOC’s communications.', 'We used feedback data to create a trigger matrix that identifies appropriate and effective responses based on particular events or scenarios.', 'This information is then used to identify what information needs to be disseminated while communicating what actions need to take place for a successful response.', 'LOWE’S COMMAND CENTER The Lowe’s Command Center (CC) was founded post Hurricane Hugo in 1989, to provide rapid response support to associates, customers and communities impacted by natural disasters.', 'At the outset of the COVID-19 pandemic, we refocused the CC to serve as a pandemic command center, guiding and supporting Lowe’s response and support efforts, while also coordinating our response to natural disasters.', 'In 2021, we transitioned our focus to address all hazards—anything that puts Lowe’s people or assets at risk.', 'This expanded focus includes an evaluation of what infrastructure, product and support is needed, how many locations are affected and where we should deploy our resources after a hazardous event, all with the intention of supporting the communities we serve.', '46', ' 2021 CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT', 'We also strengthened our natural disaster rapid response capabilities by expanding our staged inventory program in 2021.', 'This program places loaded and pre-positioned trucks carrying items such as generators, chainsaws, water and tarps around the United States for quick deployment after a major event.', 'From wind to flood to wildfire events, these trucks contain the range of products that communities need to either respond to, or recover from, a major event.', 'During Hurricane Ida, which struck the Louisiana coast in August 2021, nearly all these resources were deployed to support our customers and communities.', 'Rapid response doesn’t stop with our customers and communities.', 'To support our associates, throughout 2021, we deployed thousands of meal and hygiene kits, as well as our Lowe’s branded washer/dryer and shower trailers, providing our associates the support they needed as they took care of not only their families, but also our customers and communities after a major event.', 'CEO LETTER', 'OVERVIEW', 'HIGHLIGHTS', 'OUR PEOPLE & OUR COMMUNITIES', 'PRODUCT SUSTAINABILITY', 'OPERATIONAL EXCELLENCE', 'INDICES', 'BUILDING FOR RESILIENCE In 2020, we conducted our first formal TCFD analysis to assess our exposure to climate-related risks and better understand the impacts on our value chain.', 'To evaluate the potential impacts to our business, we identified possible stressors to our business model in accordance with various climate scenarios and reviewed these stressors with a cross-functional team to determine the risks and opportunities across our value chain.', 'Going forward, TCFD topics will be further integrated into the overall strategic direction of the company as climate-related risks continue to grow.', \"Lowe's will also increase alignment with TCFD to measure, manage and report our climate impact.\", 'For more details on TCFD, please see the TCFD reporting section at the end of this report.', 'NEXT FOR BUSINESS RESILIENCE STEPS We are committed to positioning ourselves to be prepared to respond and help our associates, customers and the communities where we live and work.', 'We will continue our commitment to help communities be “Lowe’s Ready” for extreme weather events by bolstering our response efforts and capabilities.', 'In addition, we are examining ways for the GSOC to develop an engaged crisis support team process to ensure complete coverage over all aspects of our business.', 'THE NEXT 100 YEARS', '47', ' 2021 CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT', 'CEO LETTER', 'OVERVIEW', 'HIGHLIGHTS', 'OUR PEOPLE & OUR COMMUNITIES', 'PRODUCT SUSTAINABILITY', 'OPERATIONAL

delivering incredibly strong business results.', 'We’ve built enduring trust with our guests throughout the pandemic, in large part because of the investments we’ve made for several years—in our

we’ve made to racial equity also started with our team.', 'Our focused diversity, equity and inclusion (DE&I) strategy dates back a decade and a half.', 'We publicly release ambitious DE&I goals on a regular basis, against which we’ve made good progress.', 'And last year we created our Racial Equity Action and Change (REACH) Committee to further accelerate progress for Black team members, guests and communities.', 'Initiatives created by REACH, like our pledge to increase representation of Black team members across our team by 20% in the next three years, are attempts to dismantle systemic inequities.', 'Other initiatives, like our full-team anti-racism trainings and immersions, are intended to support empathy, acumen and effective action for everyone at Target.', 'As you’ll see in the pages ahead, the actions we’ve taken to advance racial equity outside our company are also very substantial, and they’re designed to have a lasting positive impact well beyond our core business.', 'They include our plan to spend $2 billion with Black-owned businesses by 2025, the creation of our Scholars Program in partnership with historically Black colleges and universities (HBCUs), and

sustainable brands; innovating to eliminate waste; and accelerating opportunity and equity.', 'Through Target Forward we’ve articulated new goals, with transparent public measurements, and accelerated our progress on goals we’d already announced.', 'For instance, we’re committing to moving faster toward net zero emissions, which we’ll now achieve by 2040.', 'As we’ve seen for years, sustainability

safe during the pandemic, use the power of our brand to address the effects of systemic racism and build a sustainability plan that’s integrated into every area of our business.', 'You can see this in a number of ways: The $1 billion we invested in the health, safety and well-being of our team last year—including accelerating our move to raise our minimum starting wage to $15 an hour, as well as adding new mental health and child-care benefits • The financial and pro bono support we provided for Black, Indigenous and people of color (BIPOC) communities in the wake of the murder of George Floyd • And how we’ve continued to use Target’s historic strength in great design to elevate our efforts in areas like sustainability and inclusion—with stores, products and experiences that limit

actions.', 'That’s so important in corporate responsibility because when your strategy and tactics are consistent with what you are as a company, it’s much easier to embed that work into every area of your business.', 'For instance, we’ve made sustainability a key pillar in Target’s strategic roadmap.', 'And our new sustainability strategy, Target Forward, reflects that enterprise-wide

and civic affairs.', 'That focus was increasingly important in 2020, as communities across the nation grappled with a global pandemic and calls for racial justice during a national election year.', 'We believe cooperation is key to bringing people together and helping us all work toward our collective interests.', 'As one of the largest employers in the U.S., operating in all 50 states and the District of Columbia, we believe it is important to lend our voice and experience to the public policy issues that affect our business and the community.', 'That’s why it is—and has always been— important to us to work with government officials to shape equitable, effective public policies for our business and industry, our team members, our guests and our communities.', 'Some of the top issues in the last year included: The COVID-19 pandemic and related public policy issues • Tax • Employment policy • Trademark reform • Trade •', 'We adhere to applicable laws that govern our interactions with public officials and to our own company policies and disclosure practices.', 'We work with elected officials of both political parties to help shape constructive public policy solutions that benefit our business, team, guests and the communities we serve.', 'Our Approach Responding to the Pandemic As an essential retailer, we have been operating in all 50 states since the pandemic started.', 'As more businesses began to reopen, we recognized how difficult it could be for them and the considerable adjustments they would need to make to their business all at once.', 'We also recognize that communities and businesses are reliant on each other to create jobs and make communities the unique places that we’ve all come to know.', 'From that perspective, we developed the SAFE Retail toolkit.', 'The SAFE Retail toolkit is a resource available to any business that may be thinking about how to operate differently for some time into the future.', 'It includes the processes and tools that we adopted to continue our operations while prioritizing public health and employee and community safety, packaged into a 60-page resource.', 'It’s not only an overview of the changes Target made, but also offers general resources for other businesses to immediately use.', 'We shared the SAFE Retail toolkit with governors’ offices, business organizations and local- and county-level officials across the country.', 'We spoke at webinars to share these learnings directly with small businesses and made it available online for anyone to access at it at any time.', 'Our REACH Aims: Public Policy & Civic Engagement As part of our REACH commitments, Target will work with policymakers to address key issues such as safety and police reform, advancing education and economic opportunities for Black Americans and supporting nonpartisan efforts to encourage fair, accessible and safe voting.', 'We recognize that we’re coming into this work without having all the answers.', 'While our approach will focus on Black team members, guests and communities, we will be open-minded and collaborate with multiple community voices.', 'Read more about our REACH

engagement at Target and provide meaningful opportunities for civic participation.', 'To help do that, we recruit team members to shape and participate in our Citizens@Target network, which promotes nonpartisan, informed civic participation efforts that strengthen society and support our team and business.', 'The Citizens@Target network hosts information sessions, including an event series on civil discourse and encouraging conversations across political divides.', 'We have long offered paid time off to vote and introduced paid time off to work as an election judge for all team members.', 'We also offered employees free rides to and from polls through Lyft where permitted by law and provided information, tools and resources so our team members and guests across the country could successfully participate in elections.', 'We partnered with several national organizations to encourage voting, including the Civic Alliance, National Voter Registration Day, Vote Early Day, the League of Women Voters Education Fund and Time to Vote.', 'Our Political Advocacy As a retailer and employer of over 350,000 team members, we play a constructive role in informing policymakers about many legislative issues.', 'We advocate at all levels of government, sometimes through trade associations and policy-based organizations, to ensure that the impact legislative and regulatory issues have on our business, industry, communities and team members is understood.', 'We work with elected officials of both political parties to help shape constructive public policy solutions that benefit our business, team, guests and the communities we serve.', 'One way we do this is through contributions from our TargetCitizens Political Action Committee (PAC).', 'TargetCitizens PAC is funded through voluntary contributions by eligible team members and contributes in a bipartisan manner to federal candidates and organizations.', 'PAC contributions are based on policy and business

scope of positive impact on the world.', 'Instead, it focuses on measuring the dollar value of risk / return.', 'We need to create a system that measures and scrutinizes actual positive impact on our planet, so unsuspecting individual investors can choose to support companies that can make and prioritize positive change.', 'Individual investors – who entrust their money to ESG funds of large investment institutions – are perhaps unaware that their money can be used to buy shares of companies that make climate change worse, not better.', 'On the product front, companies should be required to use real-world data wherever remotely feasible and make it clear when estimates are provided instead of real-world figures.', 'An example of this is vehicle “use-phase” emissions, accounting for the vast majority of lifecycle emissions.', \"Automakers' estimates on lifetime vehicle mileage and lifetime fuel consumption vary dramatically and almost never reflect real-world data.\", 'Automakers often have access to this data, but they don’t disclose it.', 'An obvious example of this is measuring the impact of the automotive industry.', 'One might think that the more electric vehicles an automaker sells, as a percentage of total volumes, the better its ESG score.', 'However, this is not the case.', 'As long as a company continues to slightly decrease emissions of its manufacturing operations while churning out gas-guzzlers, its ESG ratings are likely to go up.', 'Vehicle use-phase emissions, which represent 80-90% of total automotive emissions (included in Scope 3 of ESG reporting), tend to be misreported due to the use of unrealistic assumptions or not reported at all.', 'It’s easy to see why some oil & gas companies rank higher than Tesla on “Environmental Impact.”', '“The most striking feature of the [ESG rating] system is how rarely a company’s record on climate change seems to get in the way of its climb up the ESG ladder—or even to factor at all.”

have a safe workplace and that they are rewarded appropriately, with significant upside if their employer does well.', 'Many ESG ratings evaluate: “Does this ESG issue impact the profitability of the company?” We need a system that evaluates: “Does the growth of this company have a positive impact on the world?” This evolution of ESG needs to be championed by institutional investors, rating agencies, public companies and the general public.', 'As the world needs to strive for a substantial positive impact, we won’t be referring to ESG in this report.', 'Instead, we’ll talk about

volumes and the accessibility of our products.', 'In more concrete terms, this means that by 2030 we are aiming to sell 20 million electric vehicles per year (compared to 0.94 million in 2021) and deploy 1,500 GWh of energy storage per year (compared to 4 GWh in 2021).', 'If we were to achieve such a vehicle delivery milestone through a consistent growth rate, the total Tesla vehicle fleet would surpass tens of millions of vehicles by 2030, and each of those vehicles could save tons of CO2e emissions every year of usage.', 'Furthermore, each product we make must be continuously improved at each step of its lifecycle: from manufacturing to consumer use to recycling.', 'We must also improve every metric, including the energy and water used to make our products, how safe our customers and employees are and the affordability and accessibility of our products.', 'Each of these themes will be covered in this year’s Impact Report.', '7', ' Making an Impact Mission and the Tesla

reviewing the effectiveness of Tesla’s Impact priorities, initiatives and programs and this report.', 'With those responsibilities in mind, the Board sets high standards for Tesla and its employees, officers and directors; and we periodically add new, highly qualified independent directors to the Board, such as Larry Ellison and Kathleen Wilson-Thompson in 2018 and Hiromichi Mizuno in 2020.', 'Implicit in this approach is the importance of sound corporate governance.', '11', ' Corporate Governance Introduction', 'Sound corporate governance is critical to our mission.', 'We are committed to establishing an operating framework that exercises appropriate oversight of responsibilities at all levels throughout the company and manages its affairs consistent with high principles of business ethics.', 'Tesla aspires to be a “do the right thing” company.', 'Our Code of Business Ethics sets out basic principles that should help anyone working at or for Tesla avoid even the appearance of improper behavior.', 'Tesla’s Code of Business Ethics and our Corporate Governance Guidelines are available on Tesla’s website.', 'In addition, we believe in regular and transparent communication with employees.', 'We encourage Tesla employees to share their feedback openly (and anonymously, if they prefer), and provide easy methods to do so.', 'We also regularly conduct employee surveys to identify strengths and opportunities for improvement.', 'We have a robust action planning process to ensure we proactively address the concerns or feedback.', 'We also have a whistleblower hotline through which employees can report concerns at any time.', 'Tesla keeps information reported by employees in confidence, whether through the hotline or another channel.', 'Our policies prohibit retaliatory actions against employees for raising concerns or making complaints.', 'We are committed to maintaining an open and transparent culture where it is safe and acceptable for all employees to raise concerns about policy violations by their manager or colleagues or about the workplace overall.', '12', ' Corporate Governance Our Approach', 'Our unique business requires a unique approach to corporate governance.', 'And our mission requires a long-term focus that we believe will ultimately maximize value to our employees and our stockholders.', 'Our corporate governance structure has facilitated several key decisions which might have appeared counter-intuitive to some, but which have set up the Tesla to achieve long-term success.', 'Some examples include our decisions to: •', 'Manufacture all-electric vehicles (EVs) from the ground up rather than being a mere supplier of EV components', '•', 'Establish an international network of our own stores, service centers and Supercharger stations despite regulatory hurdles and the significant capital outlay required to do so', '•', 'Build Gigafactory 1, the largest lithium-ion battery factory in the world, so that we can scale most effectively', '•', 'Expand into energy generation and storage through the acquisition of SolarCity Corporation in 2016 to create a vertically integrated sustainable energy company and empower individual consumers to be their own utility', '•', 'Deploy FSD city streets beta software to our fleet to develop complete Full Self-Driving capability in the future', '•', 'Compensate our CEO only if other shareholders realize tremendous value', 'These and other similar decisions were made due to our corporate governance structure and, ultimately, decisions like these are what differentiate Tesla from other companies and are a significant reason why the annualized stockholder return since our 2010 IPO until December 31, 2021 equaled 65%.', 'At the same time, the Board continuously evaluates our corporate governance structure, practices and policies, and weighs stakeholder feedback including proposals we have historically received at our annual meetings.', 'For example, at our 2021 annual meeting of stockholders, the Board proposed and recommended that stockholders adopt an amendment to our certificate of incorporation to reduce the term of our directors to two years.', 'However, our stockholders did not approve that proposal.', 'The Board is directly and regularly engaged with senior management and the Sustainability Council and participates in robust

Compensation Philosophy', 'Our compensation philosophy reflects our long-term mission and our startup origins.', 'We emphasize structuring compensation to reward our named executive officers based on performance, and equity awards weigh heavily in our named executive officers’ total compensation, including awards that vest upon the achievement of clear and measurable milestones.', 'Since these awards increase in value as our stock price increases (and in the case of stock option awards, have no value unless our stock price increases following their grant), our named executive officers’ incentives are closely aligned with the long-term interests of our stockholders.', 'Tesla has no cash bonus program for any of our named executive officers and generally does not provide any perquisites or tax reimbursements to our named executive officers that are not available to other employees.', 'No named executive officer has any severance or change of control arrangement, except as reflected in Elon Musk’s performance-based 2018 CEO Performance Award.', 'A change in control modifies the vesting requirements of the 2018 CEO Performance Award such that vesting of the Award’s tranches would be measured based on Tesla’s market capitalization at the time of the change of the control, without regard to the operational milestones of the Award.', 'Elon Musk, our Chief Executive Officer, historically earned a base salary that reflected the applicable minimum wage requirements under California law, and he was subject to income taxes based on such base salary.', 'However, he has never accepted his salary.', 'Commencing in May 2019 at Mr. Musk’s request, we eliminated altogether the earning and accrual of this base salary.', 'Consequently, 100% of Mr. Musk’s compensation is at-risk.', 'Similarly, the compensation program for Tesla’s non-employee directors is designed to be consistent with our compensation philosophy for our employees, with an emphasis on equity-based compensation over cash in order to align the value of their compensation with the market value of our stock, and consequently, with the long-term interests of our stockholders.', 'Moreover, while we offer to our general employee population restricted stock units that will retain some value even if the market value of our stock decreases, the equity-based compensation to our directors has been exclusively in the form of stock options, which have zero initial value and accumulate value, if at all, only to the extent that our stock price increases following their grant, through the applicable vesting dates and until such stock options are ultimately exercised and the underlying shares are sold.', 'The remaining portion of our directors’ compensation has been comprised of cash retainer payments that are relatively modest compared to peer companies and that may be waived at the election of each director.', 'Further, in June 2021, the Board adopted a resolution that all existing directors forego any automatic grants of annual stock option awards under our director compensation policy until July 2022 unless the Board determines otherwise.', '16', ' Corporate Governance Data

projects and investments in mining countries to have a positive environmental and social impact.', 'Tesla will then explore an expansion to manganese, graphite, copper and mica.', '111', ' Responsible Sourcing Supplier Audit Program', 'Tesla’s Supplier Audit program In 2018, Tesla initiated its Supplier Audit program with the objective to extend our supplier performance evaluation to key environmental and social impact metrics relevant to Tesla’s business.', 'This program extension was introduced at the time when Tesla was transitioning from a small automotive manufacturer to a company gaining recognition as the leader in electrical vehicle production.', 'We recognized that this growth came with an increased ability to impact positive change on the practices of our suppliers, but also with an increased responsibility to drive such change in line with our mission statement.', 'During the program pilot phase, we focused our efforts on suppliers that we deemed high risk based on their industry or the use of potentially dangerous processes and/or chemicals in the manufacturing of our parts.', 'We chose to utilize the Responsible Business Alliance’s (RBA) Validated Assessment Program (VAP) as the basis for our audits.', 'The RBA’s VAP is an audit protocol globally recognized for its breadth of topics and stringent requirements for supplier completion.', 'It covers nearly 200 checkpoints across labor, health and safety, environmental, ethical and management system topics.', 'Audits are conducted by independent third parties that are approved by the RBA, and all auditors must undergo training by the RBA on the audit standard and its implementation ensuring a globally and industry-wide standardized approach.', 'In any case where any priority non-conformance (the most significant type) occurs, our audit procedures require that suppliers undergo a closure audit.', 'These closure audits – which are a follow up to the original audit where the non-conformances were identified – allow suppliers to address all non-conformances in the earlier audits.', 'Additional audits, rather than an immediate suspension of the business relationship, are preferred to improve working conditions and reduce the risk of continued deficiencies.', 'As of the end of 2021, we had a total of 152 supplier locations go through our supplier audit at least once, representing 144 suppliers, or 10% of 2021 spend with our direct supply base.', 'As part of these audits over 4,000 supplier employee interviews were conducted.', '112', ' Responsible Sourcing Supplier Audit Expansion', 'Continuing to expand our audit program In 2021, Tesla redefined its criteria for determining which of our suppliers are subject to the Supplier Audit program.', 'While in its initial stages the suppliers subject to the audit were mainly located in China, and the updated criteria expanded the scope to include significantly more suppliers globally.', 'When we started our audit program, we had only just announced our plans for Gigafactory Shanghai.', 'We now have six factories across three different continents, and our production volume of vehicles has grown exponentially.', 'As our global footprint and manufacturing grew, so did our supply base.', 'Therefore, the expansion of our audit program was an important step to ensure that our supplier due diligence efforts continue to reflect the realities of our supply chain and can properly identify and address potential risks within our supply base.', 'The criteria on which suppliers are selected to undergo the Supplier Audit is based on an expanded risk assessment approach, looking at Tesla’s exposure to suppliers financially, as well as suppliers’ location.', 'This criteria determines which suppliers are obligated to undergo an audit, but additional suppliers can be nominated by our commercial and supplier industrialization teams where they see value in doing so or the potential to further mitigate risk.', 'With the expanded audit program scope, we are targeting to cover over 50% of our global spend with our direct supply base.', 'As part of our program expansion, we are building on our ability to influence supplier behavior in a positive way.', 'When a supplier is not meeting our expectations, they are obligated to implement corrective action plans to remedy any deficiencies or non-conformances found during the audit process, regardless of the severity.', 'In cases of the highest priority non-conformances, suppliers are required to undergo closure audits to ensure that their corrective action plans have been fully implemented.', 'In cases of less severe non-conformances, suppliers are still required to develop and implement corrective action plans as well as provide evidence to Tesla that those plans have been fully implemented within our expected timelines.', 'Furthermore, we defined a separate category called Zero Tolerance Violations, which, for example, include any violations related to the use of forced or child labor and inhumane treatment of workers.', 'In cases where such instances are discovered, our supply chain leadership will be informed, and a corrective action plan will be developed immediately, together with the supplier.', 'Tesla will transition away from the supplier relationship if the supplier is unable or unwilling to correct the identified issues and improve their operations within a reasonable time frame.', '113', ' Responsible Sourcing Identifying Priorities', 'How we identify and prioritize risks in our supply chain Our Supplier Audit program is an important part of our efforts to identify and address environmental and social risks within our supply chain.', 'These audits allow for a snapshot of a supplier facility’s programs and procedures, but also sets a baseline for future evaluations.', 'Additionally, Tesla utilizes other avenues to evaluate potential risks in our supply chain such as those detailed below.', 'We engaged with several third-party service providers allowing us to continually monitor our supply chain for emerging issues that may affect our suppliers.', 'These include issues related to labor relations, human rights and environmental degradation.', 'This monitoring allows our Global Supply Managers to be notified as soon as information about suppliers becomes public and act by engaging directly with the supplier to understand their plans for correcting the identified risk.', 'Tesla follows the OECD Due Diligence Guidance for Responsible Business Conduct when identifying risks within our supply chain.', 'We require suppliers to cooperate with our efforts and assist in identifying and removing practices within our supply chain that are contradictory to our policies.', 'Our responsible sourcing policies require suppliers to provide requested information regarding potential violations of our policies.', 'Furthermore, we continue to leverage our membership with the RBA to identify upcoming supply chain risks as well as understand industry best practices to address them.', 'We are actively involved with the RMI as well as specific action groups within the organization.', 'In addition, we have utilized many of the RBA tools, such as country risk analysis to understand inherent risks in our supply chain and RBA-Online to collect information on
