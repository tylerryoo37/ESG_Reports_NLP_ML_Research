      "This is accompanied by public goals for our most significant environmental issues–backed by internal audits, and in certain instances, receiving limited assurance by a third party.\n",
      "\n",
      "As always, we will approach new goals, like our recent net zero goal, with the same focus on transparent reporting and rigorous measurement that we have followed since we first began publicly reporting our performance on ESG topics over 15 years ago.\n",

      "Our commitment to impact Our annual Purpose Report holds us accountable to our stakeholders and society.\n",

      "Leading the way toward the future of work Technologists have predicted for years that hybrid work—in which employees split their time working from home, office, and on the go—is the way of the future.\n",
      "\n",
      "But no one could have predicted quite how 2020’s mass transition to remote working would unfold.\n",
      "\n",
      "After nearly two years in which students and office workers have operated mostly from home, we believe hybrid work is here to stay.\n",
      "\n",
      "In this still-being-charted territory, employers, including Cisco, have been forced to reexamine our notions of employee communication, safety, career development, work-life balance, and the future of the workplace itself.\n",
      "\n",
      "Innovating to make work more human We’ve seen some of the benefits of this new reality, such as more flexible schedules, less time and emissions spent commuting to an office, and career possibilities that are not dependent on one’s location.\n",
      "\n",
      "We have also discovered some of the challenges.\n",
      "\n",
      "Many organizations have concerns about security and business continuity now that their networks no longer start and end at a campus, branch, or data center.\n",
      "\n",
      "People have experienced profound isolation—as well as the challenges of sharing space with children and other family members during the workday.\n",
      "\n",
      "Video calls can be hampered by poor quality that diminishes engagement, and too many meetings can lead to anxiety and fatigue.\n",

      "Our journey to net zero Cisco has a long history of setting and achieving goals to reduce our environmental impact.\n",
      "\n",
      "In early fiscal 2022, we made our most important commitment yet: a pledge to reach net zero greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 2040, 10 years ahead of when climate scientists say the planet must reach net zero to avoid the worst impacts of climate change.\n",
      "\n",
      "This goal will cover all scopes of emissions, including those from our direct operations, our supply chain, and from the use of our products.\n",
      "\n",
      "We also plan to achieve net zero for our global Scope 1 and 2 emissions, which covers our direct operations, by 2025.\n",

      "Here are five ways we’ll work toward net zero in the years ahead: Continuing to increase the energy efficiency of our products through innovative product design.\n",
      "\n",
      "The largest share of Cisco’s emissions comes from the use of our products—and we are continuing to work to make these products more energy efficient.\n",
      "\n",
      "We are making progress through innovations like Silicon One, our programmable chip for high- performance networking, which can be found in our Cisco 8201 router.\n",

      "Accelerating use of renewable energy.\n",
      "\n",

      "Within Cisco, we anticipate a 20 to 30 percent decline in employee commuting compared to pre-pandemic levels.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fewer trips will decrease our Scope 3 emissions from employee commuting.\n",

      "In a pandemic-altered world, people exchange more information online than ever before as remote work becomes more commonplace.\n",

      "And while many organizations have embraced the benefits of remote work arrangements, businesses have also been exposed to new risks.\n",
      "\n",
      "For example, remote desktop protocols (RDPs) can be compromised through stolen credentials, “man-in-the- middle” attacks (in which an attacker puts themselves in the communication line between two parties), and remote code execution (where an attacker runs their code on a machine or server of their choosing).\n",
