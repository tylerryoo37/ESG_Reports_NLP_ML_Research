solutions, which include the transceiver CPO, switch CPO and AI/ML CPO, aimed at addressing next generation bandwidth and power challenges.', 'Our purpose-built switch CPO platform combines Broadcom’s leading-edge switch silicon and optics on the same package substrate to deliver the industry’s highest power efficiency.', 'Having the switch directly driving the optics significantly reduces the interconnect power and thereby increases the system power handling capability.', 'Compared to conventional discrete solutions, these switch CPO solutions are expected to deliver 30% power consumption savings while providing 40% lower optics costs per bit.', 'Broadcom is best positioned to lead CPO product development and help data center operators reduce their power consumption.', 'For more information, see our Co-Packaged Optics (CPO).', 'Enable Green Energy Systems As the world moves toward green energy systems and away from fossil fuels, Broadcom’s industrial products continue to help support these green energy systems.', 'Broadcom optocouplers are used in an array of green applications ranging from solar and wind inverters, energy storage, automotive electric vehicles, and charging and power supplies.', 'The popularity of Broadcom optocouplers in these green applications is due to their ability to drive inverters more efficiently, to reduce copper losses by providing high insulation voltage and to consume less power during current sensing and data transmission.', 'For example, Broadcom’s isolated gate drive and optocoupler products are used in renewable energy storage systems that store electricity when the demand is low and supply stored electricity when the demand is high.', 'This improves the energy efficiency of the power generation system and stabilizes operation of the electricity grid – both at a utility scale and a home scale.', 'For more information, see our Optocouplers and Opto-Isolators and Industrial Fiber Optics.', '12 BROADCOM

compensation (such as our annual cash bonus program, sales incentive plans and spot bonuses) and equity awards.', 'Broadcom is different from its peer companies because a vast majority of our employees receive equity awards that vest over time.', 'We grant equity to our employees because we want our employees to share in Broadcom’s success.', 'We believe that equity compensation aligns the interest of our employees with our stockholders, is a key factor in recruiting and retaining top talent and assists in the successful and rapid integration of our employees who join Broadcom through acquisitions.', 'Nurse Triage 24 Hour Program In 2021, we provided Nurse Triage 24 Hour (NT24) to our U.S. employees.', 'NT24 is a hotline that is staffed 24 hours a day and 365 days out of the year by highly-trained registered nurses.', 'NT24 gives our U.S. employees access to immediate medical guidance for non-emergency work-related injuries or illnesses.', 'NT24’s registered nurses help

internal data about the types of conduct matters we investigate and their outcomes.', 'Supporting and respecting the rights of all people Our commitment to supporting and respecting internationally proclaimed human rights is a common thread connecting our business and requires the support of our leaders, people and suppliers.', 'As stated in our COBE, we focus our human rights efforts where they are most relevant to Accenture.', 'For Accenture in Sweden that means for example; • Diversity and equal opportunity by eliminating discrimination in employment and applying our principle of meritocracy when we make decisions about our people; • Employment conditions and working practices and respecting the right to form and freely join legally constituted representative bodies and working in good faith with them; • Maintaining a respectful environment for our people, through COBE and Conduct Counts, by respecting the rights of our people relating to health, safety and security.', '• It also means protecting the privacy and security of personal data and using personal data responsibly.', '• Complying with all anticorruption laws without exception, regardless of local business culture or practices and respecting human rights in our supply chain in a manner consistent with our Supplier Standards of Conduct.', '• Our clients and other stakeholders increasingly look to us for visibility into our human rights commitments and policies.', 'Some of our key global policies are publicly available through our Modern Slavery Transparency Statement to show how we

been no significant findings during fiscal 2021.', 'We continually assess and refine our Ethics & Compliance program, including how we train our people.', 'Our approach provides a baseline of training to all Accenture people, including our part-time employees and contractors.', 'Individuals in higher-risk roles receive additional anticorruption and other compliance training.', 'Digital responsibility As technology becomes ubiquitous, trust becomes paramount.', 'To build—and maintain—trust in today’s digital age, businesses must use data and artificial intelligence (AI) ethically across customer information, product development and workforce training.', 'Security and AI are among the topics within our Technology Quotient (TQ) training available to all Accenture people.', 'In fiscal 2020, Accenture introduced TQ—a new training program to make tech fluency table stakes for everyone.', 'The more our people can discuss technology in plain language, the more our clients can, too—and the easier it will be for them to adapt to changes and explain them to their customers, shareholders and employees.', 'At the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021, approximately 91% of Accenture’s people in Sweden had started their TQ journeys.', 'By using technology responsibly, we are considering the extended consequences of each new innovation—both positive and negative— on

success depends, in part, on our ability to continue to develop and implement services and solutions that anticipate and respond to the rapid and continuing changes in technology and offerings to serve the evolving needs of our clients.', 'Facing the unique challenges created by COVID-19 and large employee populations working remotely, we took additional steps to protect sensitive health data while operating safely and effectively.', 'With a goal to stabilize, normalize and optimize our approach to the changing environment, we strengthened our processes and privacy controls already in place to enable a secure and safe mobile workforce, and enhanced information security and data protection training to include guidance on how to securely work from home.', 'For example: • Work-from-home users received specific guidance and job aids.', 'Advanced Technology Centers and Intelligent Operations Centers received increased levels of guidance.', '• Accenture quickly amended—and continues to update—our dedicated internal information security websites and communications with up-to-date work-from-home guidance and COVID-19 scam awareness.', '• We generated global awareness of our guidance around work-from-home security practices and increased participation in the Information Security Advocate program.', '• Accenture applied our Client Data Protection (CDP)

acknowledged through receipt of both Enterprise and Client Service Business ISO® 27001:2013 and ISO® 27701 certifications.', 'We take security seriously, with extensive training and learning assets.', 'All Accenture people regularly participate in required and targeted data privacy trainings.', 'Further, our global awareness campaign, Protecting Accenture: Live Smart to Stay Safe, equips our people with the latest best practice learnings and behaviors necessary to maintain safe hygiene of data security.', 'Beyond our required, comprehensive training tracks, 99% of our people in Sweden have completed one tier of our Information Security Advocate program, which is a set of self-paced courses, designed to strengthen employee awareness and adoption of secure behaviors.', 'Furthermore, over half of the people at Accenture in Sweden choose to expand their knowledge completing additional in-depth information security trainings.', 'Employees who complete the Information Security Advocate program are significantly less likely to contribute to an incident and outperform non-Advocates in identifying phishing email indicators and passing phishing tests.', 'In addition to keeping

business-as-usual, worst-case scenario climate emissions trajectory model and provides an upper-boundary condition to support our analysis and risk-management measures.', 'This preliminary analysis

proclaimed human rights is a common thread connecting our business and requires the support of our leaders, people and suppliers.', 'As stated in our COBE, we focus our human rights efforts where they are most relevant to Accenture.', 'For Accenture in Sweden that means for example; • Diversity and equal opportunity by eliminating discrimination in employment and applying our principle of meritocracy when we make decisions about our people; • Employment conditions and working practices and respecting the right to form and freely join legally constituted representative bodies and working in good faith with them; • Maintaining a respectful environment for our people, through COBE and Conduct Counts, by respecting the rights of our people relating to health, safety and

regularly engage with our suppliers and we are working to improve our multi-tier supply chain visibility.', 'In 2021, we undertook several initiatives to strengthen our human rights program within our supply chain, including: • Becoming a member of RBA • Updating our Supplier Code to reflect the RBA Code of Conduct and translating our Supplier Code into Chinese • Updating our supplier onboarding process to increase screening for human rights-related matters • Expanding our supplier monitoring program to screen for human rights issues, which includes over 90% of our current supply chain suppliers (based on our 2020 supplier spend) • Sending our first annual supplier expectations communication to reinforce our commitment to a responsible supply chain and provide suppliers with information on our supply chain human rights program, including our updated Supplier Code and access to training • Conducting an expanded human rights survey of our supply chain suppliers • Remediating human rights concerns raised in our 2020 supplier human rights survey—specifically four suppliers who used fines to discipline workers and one supplier who did not permit collective bargaining no longer engage in these prohibited practices • Offering human rights and forced labor prevention training to our suppliers • Providing human rights and forced labor prevention training to our employees • Requiring our larger manufacturing suppliers to certify adherence to our Supplier Code on an annual basis Annual Supplier Survey In 2021, we conducted our second annual survey of our significant suppliers for human rights-related issues.', 'We achieved a 100% survey response rate from our second annual survey.', 'We identified and surveyed our largest suppliers globally (based on 2020 supplier spend data) that were not part of our 2020 supplier human rights survey.', 'These suppliers, collectively with the suppliers surveyed in 2020, represent over 90% of our supply chain (based on our 2020 supplier spend).', 'We found no instances of forced labor, child labor, slavery or human trafficking among Broadcom’s suppliers.', 'However, we identified one supplier, who is located in Europe, who may use fines as a method of discipline for its workers.', 'While this practice is legal in the jurisdiction and the supplier has a well-defined written escalating disciplinary process supported by the local trade union, we have actively engaged with this supplier and requested that it discontinues this practice.', '27 BROADCOM 2021 ESG REPORT', 'Preventing Forced Labor Training In 2021, as part of our ongoing efforts to educate and raise awareness of forced labor and human trafficking issues, we required human rights awareness and forced labor prevention training

determined by its own Board of Directors.', 'To date, the Foundation has deployed $4.2 billion to support youth livelihoods and to advance financial inclusion and education in 72 countries, primarily in Africa, and this work has benefited millions of people.', 'In June 2021, the Mastercard Foundation launched Saving Lives and Livelihoods, a $1.5 billion initiative in partnership with the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC), with the aim of: ∙ Purchasing vaccines for more than 65 million people in Africa ∙ Enabling the vaccination of millions more individuals by supporting the logistics of vaccine delivery and administration ∙ Enabling vaccine manufacturing in Africa by developing the workforce ∙ S trengthening the Africa CDC’s capacity to oversee a historic vaccination exercise — and building the architecture for a health-secure future (additional information can be found here) Even before the arrival of vaccines purchased through this initiative, the Foundation’s support enabled the Africa CDC to deploy teams of rapid responders to countries to roll out vaccinations before their vaccines expired.', 'Starting in November of 2021, vaccines for 15 million people were distributed to countries across Africa, and more will continue through 2022.', 'The Africa CDC is working closely with ministries of health to set up and expand vaccination centers, train health workers and enable respected community-based leaders to promote vaccinations.', 'Progress also has been made in developing a continental vaccine- manufacturing strategy, and

business-as-usual, worst-case scenario climate emissions trajectory model and provides an upper-boundary condition to support our analysis and risk-management measures.', 'This preliminary analysis indicates that we could see increasing risk of chronic climate stressors (increasing temperatures, sea level rise) and acute climate events (flooding, drought, extreme temperatures) at a majority of the sites by 2060.', 'Such potential risks are not forecasts and are not necessarily indicative of future performance.', 'They also do not take into account potential risk-mitigation or adaptation efforts, and assume that such sites continue to operate through the dates specified.', 'Current opportunities include sustainable and resilient programs and services, such as the Priceless Planet Coalition; carbon calculator tools such as ours, which is powered by the Doconomy Åland Index; accelerated digitization of transactions; and resilience services, such as support for disaster needs.', 'Current transition risks include impacts to travel patterns and inequitable global growth.', 'We are using the results of the initial analysis to inform our key functions, including risk, strategy and government engagement.', 'Metrics and target We have made several notable commitments to combat climate change, including: ∙ Net-zero emissions by 2040 ∙ SBTi-approved GHG short-term reduction goals to reduce total Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 38% and Scope 3 emissions by 20% by 2025 from a 2016 baseline, which will be modified in 2022 as we work with SBTi to finalize our net-zero 2040 plans

take on only the toughest problems with the promise of the biggest impact, and where we can make a unique contribution.', 'In doing so, we direct the scarce talents of our people to advance computing to solve grand challenges in science, medicine, and industry.', 'NVIDIA accelerated computing has increased computational performance and scale by a million times over traditional methods in the past decade through a combination of chips, systems, and AI algorithms.', 'This lets scientists tackle problems that were previously impossible while saving huge amounts of cost and energy.', '> Decoding the COVID Spike Protein – A team led by uC San Diego’s Rommie Amaro used the NVIDIA-powered Summit supercomputer on a record- breaking, 305-million-atom simulation of the COVID spike protein.', 'The simulation doubled the state of the art in simulation size and remains the most comprehensive simulation of the virus performed to date.', '> Speeding DNA Sequencing for Same-day Diagnoses – Stanford, google, uC Santa Cruz, and Oxford Nanopore Technologies used rapid DNA sequencing to identify genetic variants and cut the time to diagnosis from two weeks to eight hours.', '> Predicting Extreme Weather – NVIDIA researchers, with scientists at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, created FourCastNet, a machine learning model that can predict the behavior of 1,000-mile-long atmospheric rivers tens of thousands of times faster than numerical simulations.', 'JENSEN HUANG Founder, President and CEO', 'Table Of Contents 2022 NVIDIA CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT MESSAgE FROM OuR CEO 3 NVIDIA’s technology has been instrumental for scientists, public health experts, and companies in addressing each stage of the COVID-19 pandemic.', 'Recent advances in accelerated clinical sequencing

societal goals.', 'I am proud that we took this action, and at Cisco, we value these principles and do all that we can to ensure that we consistently build upon the strong foundation we’ve created.', 'I’m incredibly proud of all that we’ve done this past year and how our focus on making a positive impact guides the work we do serving our customers, partners, employees, and communities.', 'Most recently, we’ve been especially focused on environmental sustainability, which is reflected in our recent commitment to reach net zero for all scopes of greenhouse gas emissions by 2040.', 'We are also continually exploring how technology can make even more possible—from enabling healthcare and education, to providing technology for governments to continue their critical work, to powering global commerce.', 'We have also learned, especially during the pandemic, that when communities lack access to technology, they can unfortunately get left behind.', 'This makes our purpose to Power an Inclusive Future for All more relevant than ever.', 'We must help bridge gaps of inequity by using our technology, extended ecosystem, and the expertise of our teams, while creating more opportunities for more people, and acting responsibly to drive change.', 'I’m excited that we’re tackling these imperatives at every level of the company.', 'Our desire to solve problems using technology and to help create a more inclusive world has led to important initiatives such as our Social Justice Beliefs and Actions; the launch of Skills for All by Cisco Networking Academy; and the Cisco Rural

operations and our supply chain is to: ● Benchmark and report operational water use and risks.', 'We use industry best practices and the World Resource Institute’s Aqueduct tool to understand how much water we use and where it comes from.', 'Our latest analysis revealed that 14 percent of Cisco’s water withdrawals are in water- stressed locations.', '● Conserve water in our direct operations, focusing on water- scarce and water-stressed locations.', 'We’ve implemented a number of water efficiency projects over the last few years, such as upgrading our irrigation controllers and installing high-efficiency water fixtures throughout our buildings.', 'We also continue to maintain a comprehensive water management system at our campus in Bangalore, India, that includes a rainwater harvesting system, an evaporative cooling system, and two sewer treatment plants.', '● Work toward setting long-term water goals at our major campuses.', 'In fiscal 2020, we met our first water neutrality target for our campus in Research Triangle Park (RTP), North Carolina.', 'We are evaluating water goals for our campuses in San Jose, California, and Bangalore, as well as opportunities to partner with organizations to develop more innovative water restoration projects around the world.', '● Advance water stewardship in water-stressed regions where our supply chain operates.', 'While water is not a significant input for our manufacturing partners, some of our component suppliers rely on water for production.', 'By engaging with suppliers, we can help drive positive outcomes within the communities where we source.', '● Promote reporting and transparency to better understand the water footprint in our global supply chain.', 'In fiscal 2021, 100 percent of our manufacturing partners and 93 percent of our top-80-percent spend component suppliers completed the 2020 CDP water survey.', 'Continued progress on waste reduction Cisco is committed to responsibly managing our waste throughout our direct operations and our supply chain.', 'We take steps to reduce the amount of waste we produce and divert the waste we do generate through recycling, composting, and donations.', 'Cisco also has programs to reuse and recycle e-scrap within our direct operations.', 'In fiscal 2021, we avoided sending approximately 73 percent* of the waste generated globally at our facilities to landfill.', 'COVID-19 continued to have a significant impact on the total waste generated at our facilities—with the majority of our sites closed, we produced significantly less waste than we did pre- pandemic.', 'Our next area of focus for our direct operations is to develop waste goals for our major campuses.', 'We have set internal waste targets for ISO 14000-certified sites and a goal to achieve zero waste to landfill at our RTP campus.', 'We are evaluating zero waste goals for our campuses in San Jose and Bangalore.', 'CHART 22: Percentage of waste diverted from landfill 2019 81%

'Building suppliers’ capabilities to conserve water Significant numbers of ICT supply chain locations are in parts of the world where drought, flooding, and other extreme weather events may put stress on water ecosystems.', 'In fiscal 2020, Cisco conducted a water survey of our suppliers that helped us identify supplier commodity types and facilities consuming high amounts of fresh water in water-stressed areas.', 'The results of the survey prompted us to engage with printed circuit board (PCB) supplier facilities based in the high-water-stressed Taihu water basin in China.', 'With the help of local environmental consultants, we identified water savings opportunities at a PCB supplier in nearby Suzhou.', 'Over the course of a year, with our guidance, the supplier completed two large water savings projects.', 'One of the projects involved installing automatic water feeding systems on their copper plating lines.', 'Now, the rinse process uses water only while parts are being washed, rather than running continuously.', 'This upgrade has allowed the supplier to save approximately 51,000 liters of fresh water per day—enough to meet the needs of a family of four for approximately six weeks.', 'Learn more about Cisco’s work to advance water stewardship within key water-stressed areas where our supply chain operates.', 'FUTURE INTRO POWER INCLUSIVE 2021 Cisco

our supply chain.', 'We work with suppliers worldwide to reduce their impacts on local ecosystems and protect the natural resources in communities where they operate.', 'To this end, we have an ongoing partnership with the Institute of Public and Environmental Affairs (IPE).', 'As a result of our work to mitigate environmental risk from supplier sites in mainland China, we were ranked #1 in the IT industry on IPE’s most recent Corporate Information Transparency Index (CITI).', 'Ongoing engagement with suppliers includes virtual training seminars and coaching to help suppliers correct pollution violations.', 'By building the capability of suppliers, we can influence better environmental performance and transparency further down in the supply chain and across our industry.', 'Protecting biodiversity with technology and investments Biodiversity is the variability among living organisms and the ecological habitats they occupy.', 'Cisco’s primary impact on biodiversity is the land we use for our facilities, a physical footprint we continue to shrink by reducing the demand for physical office space through our move toward hybrid work.', 'On a more delicious note, we host honeybee hives near our RTP campus to support healthy pollinator populations and local food systems.', 'Connected Conservation Since 2015, Cisco surveillance, data and analytics technology have
