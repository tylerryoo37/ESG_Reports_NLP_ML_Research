43012,00420057,We are committed to establishing an operating framework that exercises appropriate oversight of responsibilities at all levels throughout the company and manages its affairs consistent with high principles of business ethics.,Tesla,0
43013,00420058,Tesla aspires to be a “do the right thing” company.,Tesla,0

43015,00420060,Tesla’s Code of Business Ethics and our Corporate Governance Guidelines are available on Tesla’s website.,Tesla,0
43016,00420061,"In addition, we believe in regular and transparent communication with employees.",Tesla,0
43017,00420062,"We encourage Tesla employees to share their feedback openly (and anonymously, if they prefer), and provide easy methods to do so.",Tesla,0
43018,00420063,We also regularly conduct employee surveys to identify strengths and opportunities for improvement.,Tesla,0
43019,00420064,We have a robust action planning process to ensure we proactively address the concerns or feedback.,Tesla,0

43024,00420069,1 3 Corporate Governance Our Approach Our unique business requires a unique approach to corporate governance.,Tesla,0
43025,00420070,And our mission requires a long-term focus that we believe will ultimately maximize value to our employees and our stockholders.,Tesla,0
43026,00420071,"Our corporate governance structure has facilitated several key decisions which might have appeared counter-intuitive to some, but which have set up the Tesla to achieve long-term success.",Tesla,0
43027,00420072,"Some examples include our decisions to: • Manufacture all-electric vehicles (EVs) from the ground up rather than being a mere supplier of EV components • Establish an international network of our own stores, service centers and Supercharger stations despite regulatory hurdles and the significant capital outlay required to do so • Build Gigafactory 1, the largest lithium-ion battery factory in the world, so that we can scale most effectively • Expand into energy generation and storage through the acquisition of SolarCity Corporation in 2016 to create a vertically integrated sustainable energy company and empower individual consumers to be their own utility • Deploy FSD city streets beta software to our fleet to develop complete Full Self-Driving capability in the future • Compensate our CEO only if other shareholders realize tremendous value These and other similar decisions were made due to our corporate governance structure and, ultimately, decisions like these are what differentiate Tesla from other companies and are a significant reason why the annualized stockholder return since our 2010 IPO until December 31, 2021 equaled 65%.",Tesla,0
43028,00420073,"At the same time, the Board continuously evaluates our corporate governance structure, practices and policies, and weighs stakeholder feedback including proposals we have historically received at our annual meetings.",Tesla,0
43029,00420074,"For example, at our 2021 annual meeting of stockholders, the Board proposed and recommended that stockholders adopt an amendment to our certificate of incorporation to reduce the term of our directors to two years.",Tesla,0
43030,00420075,"However, our stockholders did not approve that proposal.",Tesla,0

43047,00420092,"We emphasize structuring compensation to reward our named executive officers based on performance, and equity awards weigh heavily in our named executive officers’ total compensation, including awards that vest upon the achievement of clear and measurable milestones.",Tesla,0
43048,00420093,"Since these awards increase in value as our stock price increases (and in the case of stock option awards, have no value unless our stock price increases following their grant), our named executive officers’ incentives are closely aligned with the long-term interests of our stockholders.",Tesla,0

43054,00420099,"Commencing in May 2019 at Mr. Musk’s request, we eliminated altogether the earning and accrual of this base salary.",Tesla,0
43055,00420100,"Consequently, 100% of Mr. Musk’s compensation is at-risk.",Tesla,0
43056,00420101,"Similarly, the compensation program for Tesla’s non-employee directors is designed to be consistent with our compensation philosophy for our employees, with an emphasis on equity-based compensation over cash in order to align the value of their compensation with the market value of our stock, and consequently, with the long-term interests of our stockholders.",Tesla,0
43057,00420102,"Moreover, while we offer to our general employee population restricted stock units that will retain some value even if the market value of our stock decreases, the equity-based compensation to our directors has been exclusively in the form of stock options, which have zero initial value and accumulate value, if at all, only to the extent that our stock price increases following their grant, through the applicable vesting dates and until such stock options are ultimately exercised and the underlying shares are sold.",Tesla,0
43058,00420103,The remaining portion of our directors’ compensation has been comprised of cash retainer payments that are relatively modest compared to peer companies and that may be waived at the election of each director.,Tesla,0
43059,00420104,"Further, in June 2021, the Board adopted a resolution that all existing directors forego any automatic grants of annual stock option awards under our director compensation policy until July 2022 unless the Board determines otherwise.",Tesla,0
